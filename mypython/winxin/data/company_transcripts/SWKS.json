This call is being recorded.", "At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.", "Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' second fiscal quarter 2017 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.", "Additionally, the results and guidance discussed today include non-GAAP financial measures, consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release at the Investor Relations section of our website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team produced another quarter of strong results in fiscal Q2. Let me begin with a few highlights.", "We delivered revenue of $852 million, up 10% year-over-year and above consensus, with gross margin of 50.4% and operating margin of 36.7%. We achieved earnings per share of $1.45, up 16% year-over-year and $0.05 better than consensus. And we continue to generate strong cash flow. Our operating cash flow in the first half of fiscal 2017 reached $732 million, up 46% as compared to the same period last year.", "In addition to our financial performance, we are aggressively expanding our design win pipeline. In mobile, we are extending our reach across all premier smartphone OEMs. Specifically, we enabled Huawei's P10 and P10+ models with low, mid and high-band SkyOne solutions, along with antenna tuner, carrier aggregation switching and power management devices.", "We powered Samsung's Galaxy S8 platform with proprietary DRx and SkyOne solutions, as well as GPS and DC/DC converters. And we secured reference design sockets across MediaTek's next generation architectures.", "In IoT, we supported Cisco's enterprise-grade MIMO gateways, delivered analog control ICs across Nintendo's gaming platforms, including the recently introduced Switch console, ramped audio solutions for Sonos' high-fidelity wireless speakers, captured Wi-Fi mesh networking wins at Google and Plume, deployed high-power smart meter devices for Itron, and we launched custom solutions for Fitbit, Garmin and LG.", "Finally, we secured strategic design wins at three leading automotive manufacturers, leveraging our advanced LTE modules supporting high-reliability connectivity, GPS and data transport capabilities. As our results demonstrate, Skyworks is capitalizing on powerful macro trends, diversifying across new markets and advancing our technology leadership. We support fast-growing mobile and IoT ecosystems, which are becoming increasingly more profitable.", "The stakeholders in these ecosystems are monetizing vast flows of data, while fostering entirely new wireless-centric business models. This dynamic is creating a new trillion-dollar economy, underpinned by e-commerce, mobile advertising, social media, and cloud-based services.", "High-speed, reliable, always-on connectivity is at the heart of this secular trend. With connected platforms requiring scores of complex devices working across dozens of frequency bands in an increasingly crowded spectrum. Skyworks addresses this complexity with a collaborative, systems-level approach, working closely with customers to create streamlined architectures.", "This demands technology breadth and depth, along with flexibility and configurability and showing the highest levels of performance. Our scale, innovative designs, robust quality and world-class supply chain provide us with significant competitive advantages.", "Within the mobile market, we facilitate the data creation and storage that allow today's smartphones to transmit and receive immense amounts of content, supporting multimedia streaming, social networking, gaming and virtual reality. We create highly integrated solution, leveraging our skills in amplification, filtering, tuning, power management and packaging, to continuously drive better performance.", "For example, our SkyOne and DRx platforms are gaining significant design traction, seamlessly delivering uplink and downlink carrier aggregation and global roaming capabilities. In addition to mobile, connectivity is proliferating into an adjacent set of IoT markets.", "Industry projections model IoT volumes to expand five-fold, reaching 75 billion units by 2025, with significant growth in areas such as connected home, smart grid, factory automation, wearables and virtual assistants. Skyworks' broad capabilities, spanning all major wireless protocols including Wi-Fi, GPS, LTE, Bluetooth and ZigBee, uniquely position us to capitalize on this immense opportunity.", "Looking ahead, we continue to address a growing set of vibrant end markets across developed and emerging economies, covering both mobile and IoT. At the same time, we are preparing for a significant 5G upgrade cycle, yet another catalyst fueling our business while leveraging our technology depth and systems expertise.", "As these powerful market forces accelerate, we are playing a leadership role in unwiring the planet, extending our reach across new markets and enabling billions of connected devices.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for an overview of our Q2 financials and outlook for Q3.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $852 million, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Revenue grew 10% compared to Q2 of last year. Gross profit was $429 million or 50.4% of revenue, with operating expenses of $116 million. As a result, we generated $313 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 36.7%. Our tax rate was 13%, driving net income of $272 million or $1.45 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.05.", "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $236 million, an increase of 53% year-over-year. Capital expenditures were $55 million, roughly 6% of sales. Dividends paid in the quarter were $52 million, and we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock for a total of $95 million. And, finally, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion and no debt.", "Now, moving to our outlook for fiscal Q3. For the third fiscal quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be $890 million. At this revenue level, we expect gross margin expansion within a range of 50.5% to 51%; with operating expenses of $122 million, as we continue to invest in grow initiatives, including our IoT business. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $0.5 million in other expense and a tax rate of 14%. We expect our share count do be approximately 186 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of our gross margin guidance, we plan to generate earnings per share of $1.52.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Kris. In summary, as our second quarter results and guidance illustrate, Skyworks is gaining momentum. Our outlook for Q3 reflects accelerating performance, with 18% revenue growth and 23% earnings per share growth on a year-over-year basis. We are clearly capitalizing on the highly profitable wireless ecosystem, underpinned by explosive growth in the new connected economy. Skyworks is leveraging these powerful macro trends, pushing the technology envelope and extending our product reach to enable the world's most exciting communications platform.", "In closing, we are well-positioned to create shareholder value while executing on our ambitious vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question will come from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please.", "Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. And congratulations on a nice quarter, guys. I guess my first question, maybe I'll just go right to China, what trends are you guys seeing there with the handset guys? Is there any sense of maybe any impact that you guys are or are not seeing from any excess inventory there? And then maybe part of that answer, if you could talk about sort of what you're looking for in terms of the content gains there, sort of in aggregate with your Chinese OEM customers?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Yeah. I mean, in the Q2 period, we did see the market demonstrate some weakness, specifically \u2013 again, in China \u2013 specifically in the Tier 2, Tier 3 guys. So we did see some of that. We had forecasted much of that in our plan. And at the same time, with the second and third tier guys falling down a bit, we saw some real strength with higher end players. Huawei being at the top of the pack with some great content, where we're now adding multiple bands of SkyOne, DRx technology, DC/DC technology, and platforms that are approaching $8 to $10 in value.", "And then the mid-tier players like Oppo and Vivo did okay as well. So the lower end of China was weak, the higher end was strong. Little bit of a correction there that we were able to model and come through, and we see that market getting better here as we go into the second half.", "Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. And then, maybe as a follow-up, if we could talk just a minute about Mexicali, sort of what the level of revenue that Mexicali can support for you guys today. Basically, what capacity I guess is today. And what kind of investments you guys have planned there to stay ahead of your top line growth? Thanks.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. We're running our back end operation pretty much at full capacity, but we have an ongoing CapEx investment to extend the capacity there in that facility. As you know, our CapEx is running on or about 7%, 8% of total revenue. And the vast majority of that CapEx goes into that back end facility.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. And one other thing to add, Rick, is that what we are seeing here and our strategy is driving is that we're selling more and more and building more and more integrated solutions. So what was a unit in Mexicali five years ago may have been a discrete PA, and now we're dealing with very complex integrated devices, whether it's SkyOne or DRx. It's actually, net-net, more favorable for us. We can control that production. We can control the actual build of those complex devices. It changes the dynamic a little bit on CapEx, but it's been definitely favorable for us.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Go ahead, please.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "Thank you for taking the question. The first question is just a clarification on the quarter. Nice to see the upside strength in revenues. Guys, where was the business a little bit stronger than you expected? And, Kris, can you give us the typical breakdown in segment revenues across the three businesses?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, Craig. I'll start with the Q2 puts and takes. Generally, a strong quarter for us, seasonal down period, but we're happy with our ability to upside our results. We saw some really good strength in our broad markets; let me start there. The broad market business on a year-over-year basis is up about 18%. That portfolio now is getting near a $1 billion run rate annually. So we're real pleased with that.", "We saw some nice uptake in some of our other mobile customers, specifically Samsung and Huawei, very good. China, we talked about. Open Market China, a little bit soft. And the balance of the business in good shape. So the big drivers really were broad markets, and then Samsung and Huawei as primaries.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. So the breakout was, broad market was slightly above 25%. As Liam just said, we continue to see nice sequential growth in the high-single digits, as well as really nice year-over-year growth in the high-double digits. And so, on the flip side, of course, mobile, which include integrated mobile in our PA business, was slightly below 75% of total revenue.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "All right. That's helpful. And then the second question is more of a longer term question, Liam. It's nice to see the business essentially back to double-digit top line growth. Can you talk about the visibility you have into sustainable levels of double-digit growth which was the company's hallmark for many years. And as we look at the longer term potential, can you just frame for us how you look at seasonality in the calendar third and calendar fourth quarter for the business, as it now runs? Thank you.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Well, I'll start with the high-level theme and then we'll hit the second half of the year. So we are absolutely convinced and have great deal of visibility into the trends around mobile and IoT and where the markets are going. I think it starts with this ecosystem that we've talked about with a tremendous cast of major, major players that thrive on a mobile economy, right? You look at the results from Amazon today, as an example.", "So we continue to see rich content, very complex architectures, road maps from our leading accounts that require more and more the kind of stuff that Skyworks does well. More integration, more creative designs, all about performance, all about performance. So we see that continuing. It's not a 2017 or 2018. This is a secular theme.", "At the same time, we're seeing IoT proliferate and we're seeing a Wi-Fi portfolio, our Bluetooth portfolio, our ZigBee portfolio move into more and more end markets and expand our customer set. So that is all real good, and it's all macro and we're looking forward to continuing to capitalize.", "More to the near term, in terms of the calendar year and the seasonality. We just went through our low point of the quarter in Q2 with good results. We guided up here in Q3. But the real big part of our year is the second half of the calendar, right?", "So Q4, Q1, we expect those numbers to continue to be up meaningfully, double-digits, into the mid-teens on both quarters. And getting into Q1, should be again a really strong quarter for us. So we're well-positioned for that. Our Q3 guidance reflects some of that. But as you start to look out over the next couple of quarters, we see accelerating growth.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Go ahead, please.", "Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah. Hey. Thanks, guys. Congratulations on tremendous results. Liam, with your Japanese filter sort of fab and factory completed and now you're generating tremendous amount of cash flow, have your goals for drop-through margins changed at all? And I think you guys had a $8 long-term earnings goal. Is that something you guys are willing to talk about or up it?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, Harsh, and I'll take that. First of all, when looking at the gross margin, I'm very pleased with the Q2 operational results. Gross margin came in at 50.4%. That was 20 basis points higher than what we expected and guided to. And so, looking ahead, as Liam just indicated, we are looking and expecting three quarters of strong sequential top line growth here in the June, September and December quarter.", "And we also expect three quarters of sequential gross margin improvements, as we benefit from the revenue growth, as we, of course, continue to drive further operational efficiencies, and as we continue to benefit from the filter in-sourcing. And so, all that will help us to make further progress towards our target model of 53% gross margin and 40% operating margin. And so, we continue to make good progress there.", "Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.", "Great. And then as my follow-up perhaps, may I ask you, Liam, you talked a lot about the IoT business. I was wondering if you could size it for us. Perhaps, maybe give us some color on what it's growing at and maybe what your margins are at in this business?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. So within our \u2013 our broad market business is on a run rate, as I indicated, of close to $1 billion. So we're not quite $250 million a quarter, but we're getting near there. IoT is about 70% of that revenue, roughly. So it's been a double-digit grower. It continues to be the leading catalyst for us in broad market. The customer set, as I noted, has expanded.", "The other thing that's a real benefit, and it's early now, but IoT is starting to move up in complexity. It's no longer just drop in a couple of Wi-Fi devices. We're starting to see filtering needs in IoT. We're starting to see LTEs with real cellular engines introduced into IoT. Our GPS technology is proliferating through IoT applications. So it's modeling content much like cell phone content was in 2002 or 2003, very basic, kind of lower connectivity. But then, as data needs increased, the performance needs within the phone expanded and we're starting to see that in IoT.", "So, today, it's a very long list of customers, provides a great deal of diversification and the content is continuing to creep up. And we're fortunate that our breadth in IoT, with all the different wireless protocols and some of the leverage that we have in our mobile business, we're in a great position to address and capitalize.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Go ahead, please.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hi, guys. Hi, Liam. Just a great quarter here despite all the worries on the China handset. So as you look at the second half, I know you guys mentioned high-teens growth and accelerating. Is that sequential growth that you are looking at for the September-December quarter?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. We're looking for sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, we're looking at the mid-teen numbers.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. It's on a year-over-year basis.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got it, got it. And as you look at Sony's marquee phones in the back half, do you expect your content share to go up, not just units, there's also a content gain story there?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. Our content story is really at the heart of our business right now. And as I mentioned, the requirements that are being driven by the leaders in the market continue to increase, and the demands are more and more challenging, the complexity is daunting. And very few companies can resolve it. We're one of them.", "We also have an advantage of being an incumbent with the leaders and understanding the nuances of calibration and tuning and working shoulder to shoulder with the engineering teams. So our position in the leading phones continues to be very strong. It will be, again, a tailwind for us in the second half of this year and even into the future.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Great. And the last question, who are the 10% customers on the quarter?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "So, during Q2, we had three greater than 10% customers. Obviously, our largest customer, which was slightly below 40% of total revenue, and then Huawei and Samsung, each of them which were slightly above 10% of total revenue. As Liam already indicated before, great traction with Huawei, expanding our product reach within multiple of their platforms. And as well with Samsung, Q2 was a great quarter, rebounding from somewhat a disappointing or a low Q1 quarter. But we really saw really nice sequential growth as well as year-over-year growth within that account.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead. Mr. Snyder, is your phone on mute?", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Sorry about that. Thanks. Last year, at your largest customer, you were pretty much exclusive on the Qualcomm platform. Do you see that as reoccurring again this year? (22:42) action with Intel? And then, if I could, how much of the revenue that you reported this quarter or you guided for next quarter was inorganic? I understand you probably picked up ANADIGICS product line from II-VI when they divested that. So just curious how much was organic versus an acquisition? Thanks.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, Ed. With respect to baseband, this isn't the first time we've seen share shifts here or any kind of diversification within the ecosystem; no surprises. And at the same time, we continue to gain great traction with both Intel and Qualcomm within our largest customer and globally.", "So, for Skyworks, baseband partnerships are really important and we are agnostic to that. The parts may change a little bit. Your calibration tuning and alignment with the chipset could be different phone to phone and baseband to baseband. But we're in very good position there, and we have excellent visibility on where that's going to play out over the next year or so. So we're in good shape. Yeah. The ANADIGICS opportunity, really it's minimal in terms of its impact on the business. So there's nothing significant there. Didn't have much of an effect on our overall performance at all.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Okay. And then, it's clear you're growing really well across a variety of different technologies. You can see it in some of the tear-downs sitting up here. Can you help us understand which of them are making the largest contributions, say, year-over-year of revenue growth, especially with regard to second half, but also this half. If you had to choose between DRx pads, LNAs, Wi-Fi, which of those are going to lead in terms of your year-on-year performance and growth? I understand DRx's are starting to move into more the mid and low-end phones, and you've got \u2013 dominate there. But then LNAs are showing up too. So can you help us with the breakdown?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, yeah. Well, I'll answer it and I'll kind of give you a little more color on it. So the SkyOne portfolio is really important, although on a year-over-year basis it doesn't have as much of a pop as a DRx, because SkyOne has been there. But I will tell you what we're doing in that product line is continuing to extend the reach of our frequency band. So we're getting into high-band. We've been in mid-band and we've been leading in low-band.", "And now, SkyOne is being adopted by more and more accounts. Accounts that a year ago may have done a multi-mode PA and had filters on the side, they're integrating. Companies like MediaTek that are going to create chipsets for Skyworks, we're starting to move those into SkyOne like architectures rather than multi-mode PAs and filters on the side. So that's a theme.", "DRx category is very powerful. We have premium technology that's defensible, that's market-leading. We've proven it in the most challenging architectures on the planet. And the compares on a year-over-year basis are very strong, because the DRX really hasn't been around too long. However, the way we do it, the way we craft it with our custom solutions, our ability to bring our own filters in-house, what we even do to craft our LNA technology and Mexicali as an integrator of all this in unique custom packages, is really special.", "So that product line has a great deal of upside. It has been lightly introduced. Every account that we've worked with, for the most part, we've been able to win, but there's a lot out there that haven't yet adopted the technology. So there is quite a bit of upside on the DRx family, and that will continue to evolve as that product gets upgraded year by year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.", "Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. and congrats on the good results and outlook. Maybe piggybacking that question, with these newer products like LNAs and DRx, GPS, can you help frame the dollar content opportunities for, say, premium, mid and, I guess, the lower end, at least what your served addressable market is in terms of dollar content per device?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Yes. So when we think about \u2013 just to frame it \u2013 the DRx category, we kind of created the name DRx and that whole segment, it really is \u2013 it's focused on downlink performance. So what we're trying to do is enhance the download speed of a device, whether it's a phone or eventually it could be an IoT device. So the traditional architectures may have been discrete with a single-chip LNA and maybe a few discrete filters and a few discrete switches. And you'd have quite a bit of lock in your system and you really wouldn't be able to harness or pull through that data fast enough.", "So we created a new category where we integrated \u2013 although similar to what we did with SkyOne moving from PA and filter and switch and brining it in with a single calibrated engine. Similar to what we did in SkyOne, we were able to craft that with our DRx product on the downlink side.", "So for us, at DRx is a $3, $4, could be $5 worth of content in certain phones. A competitor that may want to play in that area could attempt to work a discrete solution with lower content, but it just wouldn't get you the performance. And what we're been able to see and really test and measure is that our customers really value that efficiency that high efficient solution that brings in higher data rate, doesn't have the losses that you have in a discrete system. And Skyworks' doing all that calibration and harmonization work to deliver that in a simple solution. So that's kind of how it works out. And we have realized content and flagship products that's over $5 in value.", "Bill Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And maybe switching to broad markets. I guess if you were to exclude Wi-Fi, gateways or routers and consider design pipeline, how would you rank the next, let's say, fastest-growing segments in terms of content and revenue growth opportunities over the next year or so?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. There's a real wide list \u2013 a long list of proliferation across connected home applications. We mentioned a few things like Sonos, things like Nintendo, we've got Nest product, Google Nest portfolio with their Dropcam, with high-speed Wi-Fi. It may have Wi-Fi device, but it's a unique product. Whole series of opportunities there, factory automation, end-to-end with our ZigBee portfolio.", "So there's quite a few. And then if you want to move that into automotive as an adjacent market to IoT, we're starting to see really rich LTE systems that are driving all of what I said, but doing it at a bulked up level of performance to capture the kind of the needs that we see in automotive.", "Operator", "Thank you. We now have a question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi, thanks. This is Vivien on behalf of Tim. So my first question is a follow-up on China. I'm just wondering for CQ1, how much of the revenue is from China? And what is assumed for CQ2? Thanks.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "So it was approximately 25%.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "For both quarters? And...", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, yeah. Pretty much.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then my second question is that, for BAW, how much will it cost to fully develop or commercialize your captive IP? Should we think probably a few hundred million dollars?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "For BAW? For BAW, could you ask that question one more time?", "Operator", "Just a moment now, we'll reopen her line.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "I am sorry.", "Operator", "That's fine. Okay, your line is open again.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. So I'm wondering for BAW, how much will it cost to fully develop or commercialize your own captive IP? Should we think in the range of a few hundred million dollars?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "So bulk acoustic wave filter technology, it's an area that we understand completely. And what we've been doing to address the frequencies that today have been the domain of BAW, it's really about how do we address higher frequency. So we can do some of that with our TC-SAW, we can do some of that by enhancing our TC-SAW, and we could also work with partners to deliver bulk acoustic wave technology. And, certainly, the ability to do it organically is within our capability, as a company. It's difficult to assess what the value would be.", "One of the things I want to make clear to all of you is that we can address high-band solutions today in many ways. There's still a number of phones where we deliver high-band PAs and there's filters outside of the module, and there's plenty of opportunities. We've outlined a few today where we have a SkyOne solution that has fully integrated filter PA system that we're able to sell, and we use some of our foundry partners. So we're not excluded from that. But, yeah, I mean the opportunity to invest in organically is always out there on the table. We assess that all the time.", "Operator", "Thank you. We now have a question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you. Just a follow-up question on China. You mentioned it was weak, you had kind of expected that. Any signals or signs you're looking for from customers in terms of when that might inflect positively again for the China smartphone market?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, we're actually seeing it already, Craig. When we talk \u2013 or actually we probably didn't talk about it \u2013 but our coverage right now in the quarter is over 90%. We've got our China backlog where we want it to be for the quarter. We are continuing, as I said, to lead with the higher end players. Huawei being the top, and then go to Oppo and Vivo. That's becoming a bigger part of our revenue. The second and third tier white box market, less significant. So we're very confident in the recovery because we're already seeing it in our orders.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then a question for Kris on kind of inventory levels and how you think you're positioned given the expectation for strong growth into the back half of the year. Do you think you'd be in a position to be building inventory or you work off inventory? How are you managing that?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. So we did build a little bit of inventory in the second quarter. Inventory was up $22 million, but that's clearly in anticipation of the strong sequential revenue growth that we see in the next three quarters \u2013 the June quarter, the September quarter and the December quarter. And so, we expect to continue to build some further inventory in the current quarter in Q3, all in anticipation, of course, to the peak, which is in the December quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton", "Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on the progress. Liam, back to maybe BAW filters or maybe your TC-SAW products. With some of the high-band wins you've been getting, are you addressing most of those wins with TC-SAW or are these BAW-based products? I guess just what's the trend and what's your expectation?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. No, that's a great question. There's a lot of detail behind that. Well, there's a couple of ways to go. I mean, on one hand, we have an ability to deliver high-frequency products that don't have filters at all. There's still a market where we're selling multi-mode, multi-band PAs that are high-frequency, up to 5 gigs. So to be clear, that continues to be available. And filters could be outside of that.", "Then we have our integrated solutions, our SkyOne solutions. We can deliver our SkyOne to some customers by taking TC-SAW and enhancing that a little bit with tuning and getting to performance levels with good filtering and good PA technology, which again we have in-house. We have our own gallium arsenide fabs in-house. We can craft our recipe device by device. We're able to deliver that to certain parts of the market.", "Higher end or higher performing needs with certain OEMs we'll have to bring in BAW potentially from a third-party, a foundry partner that we've already engaged with and have a relationship with. So we've been that in some of our solutions. There's a number of ways to go.", "But another thing to think about here, as we move out into 5G, we talked about this in the last call, there are some technical changes in the way mobile systems will work. And in 5G, we see it move to time division duplexing from currently frequency division, FDD, frequency division duplexing. FDD, which is more or less the standard today, does require BAW duplexes at the higher frequencies.", "If you go to TDD, time division, you can actually deliver that performance with high-end TC-SAW; you don't necessarily need a duplexer. So a TC-SAW filter can be effective. So there's some changes there that will move in the favor of our current portfolio. But at the same time, we are not precluded from addressing high-band. We're doing it today. We have a number of paths to do it. And we're selling systems, not just filters. So that's really our story.", "Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton", "Thanks for that, Liam. And, Kris, your guidance for OpEx may be a little higher than I would've expected. You mentioned IoT investment. Is that the kind of the new base to work for forward, or just what are your thoughts for the next few quarters?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. So OpEx for Q2 came in at $116 million, which was 13.7% to revenue. And we are continuing to make the necessary investments to grow the business; grow the business in mobile, grow the business in IoT. Especially in IoT, we are adding some resources from an R&D point of view, as well as a sales and marketing point of view to address that diverse market segment.", "But the way to think about OpEx is that we target 13% of OpEx to revenue on a full-year basis. There will always be some seasonal situations where it's slightly higher and slightly lower. But on a full-year basis, the OpEx envelope is on or about 13% to revenue. And we are tracking very well within that envelope.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Burton with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Mike A. Burton - Longbow Research", "Hey, guys. And congrats on a great quarter and guide, especially relative to some of the China headwinds. Just wanted to drill into a little bit on the June guide. Your Korean customer obviously was a big ramp for you in Q1. They talked about some weaker unit trends in their June quarter in the low and mid-end and then stronger high-end. I'm just wondering if you're expecting that ramp in the high-end to continue for you, or are we still looking for more sequential growth out of that customer?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, Mike. Yeah, we actually, for us, the content gains that we're able to drive with Samsung are still sustainable and we still see some room here, and they will be up in Q3. Huawei is another one that we see nice sequential momentum here going into Q3, and broad markets again will be up. So those will be some of the major drivers.", "And, obviously, our largest customer is in a \u2013 we're in a period now with our largest customer where we're really readying for a pretty powerful second half ramp with their units in our content position. So those are kind of the puts and takes here. I think the big impacts here for Q3 and the upside on guidance is really relative to the big content moves that we have with Huawei and Samsung.", "Mike A. Burton - Longbow Research", "Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then also, Kris, how should we be thinking about gross margins versus revenue growth in the second half of the calendar year? Any puts and takes on mix, or how should we think about that from a contribution margin basis? Thanks, and congrats again.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "So as I stated before, we do expect three quarters of strong sequential revenue growth. And we also expect three quarters of gross margin improvements benefiting from that revenue growth as well, of course, as all the other operational efficiency that we continue to drive there.", "From a mix point of view, there's always some minor changes that works against us or in favor of us. Obviously, we continue to add more value, add more complexity. We continue to grow our IoT business, which had slightly above-average gross margin. And so, from a mix point of view, there is not a lot of movement there.", "Operator", "Thank you, again, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing remarks.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thank you all for participating today. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences and other events during the quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti ", "Thank you, Marla. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We'll then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected, as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, included, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time-to-time in our SEC filings. I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I am pleased to report that we delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2014, with fourth quarter results beating expectations across the board. The ongoing strength of our business performance reflects our success in capitalizing on the powerful underlying demand trends spanning our certain markets. And I'm particularly pleased with the broad-based nature of our business strength, highlighting the success of our diversification efforts with momentum spanning mobile, the Internet of Things and the expanding set of vertical markets. From our vantage point, we expect to continue to significantly outperform the broader semiconductor market throughout fiscal 2015 and beyond, driven by a combination of long-term secular growth drivers, share consolidation and consistent execution.", "Specifically, during the fourth quarter, we posted revenue of $718 million. That's more than a 22% sequential increase representing top line growth of 51% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. We produced operating income of $236 million. That's up 81% versus last year. We are at $1.12 in diluted earnings per share, and that's up 75% versus last year. And we generated over $200 million in cash flow from operations. We also completed our acquisition of Panasonic's Filter Division, making Skyworks the market leader in high-performance temperature compensated filters.", "Our fourth quarter performance closed another record year for our company. For the full year, we posted revenue of roughly $2.3 billion. This represents 28% in top line growth. We grew operating income by over 50%, expanding operating margins by 450 basis points. We generated over $560 million in free cash flow with a return on invested capital of 25%. And we returned over $200 million to shareholders in the form of dividend distribution and share repurchases. This represents 35% of our free cash flow.", "As a testament to our confidence in the ongoing strength of our financial performance, we're also pleased to announce that we are raising our quarterly dividend to $0.13 per share, representing an 18% increase. This increase highlights our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, as we continue to generate strong financial returns from the business.", "The combination of growth, profitability and cash flow that we delivered during fiscal 2014 is validation of our strategy of diversifying our market footprint, while investing in core analog capabilities to capture more value through integrated system solutions. We continue to see tremendous opportunity ahead as the world rapidly becomes more connected. By all measures, global demand for wireless data is skyrocketing. With each successive generation, device manufacturers are raising the bar on performance to more seamlessly integrated on-demand video, cloud-based services, enterprise data and e-commerce into the user experience. Operators are investing in networks and facilitating device upgrades to launch new services, to drive increased data traffic and provide better access to content.", "Skyworks advanced solutions are at the very heart of this technology shift. Our strategy is to capitalize on this unprecedented demand environment and it's threefold. First, we look to harness the growth and scale of mobile, capitalizing on increasing analog complexity by capturing more value through custom system solutions, while our customer diversification mitigates share shifts among OEMs. Second, cultivate the emerging Internet of Things opportunity, enabling the next wave of new connected devices through our industry-leading connectivity solutions. And third, aggressively expand into new vertical markets, leveraging our broad portfolio of precision analog solutions.", "And our Q4 design wins highlight the success we've had in addressing this new opportunities. Some of these include: multiple diversity receive module wins at a Tier 1 smartphone manufacturer; analog control ICs for GoPro for action video cameras; connectivity module supporting multiple Smartwatch platforms; custom front end solutions for streaming music platforms at Sonos and other leading wireless speaker providers; a suite of devices supporting Netgear's latest X6 Tri-band Gigabit router; dedicated short range communications, vehicle-to-vehicle solutions for GM's platforms; and finally, custom ASICs for Rockwell Collins' avionics platforms.", "Okay, for a more detailed outlook and commentary on the quarter, I'll turn it over to Don.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave. Thanks for joining for us, everyone. Our revenue for the fourth quarter was $718.2 million. That's up 22% sequentially and 51% year-over-year. Gross profit was $329.6 million or 45.9% of revenue, ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range and up 150 basis points from the year-ago period. Operating expenses were $93.9 million, consisting of R&D expense $58.2 million and SG&A expense of $35.8 million. Operating income was $235.7 million, translating into a 32.8% operating margin for the fourth quarter. Our cash tax rate was 8.4%, and that's ahead of our prior forecast as a result of fiscal year-end tax adjustments.", "Net income was $216.1 million or $1.12 of diluted earnings per share, $0.12 ahead of our original guidance. A $0.04 upside to our preannounced Q4 results consisted of a $0.01 from better-than-expected operating results and $0.03 from the more favorable fourth quarter tax rate. During the quarter, we also generated $201 million in cash flow from operations; invested $83 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $30 million; exited the fiscal year with $806 million in cash and no debt; and we repurchased 875,000 shares of our common stock.", "Moving to our product mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, power amplifiers represented 36% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 39% and broad markets was 25%. We saw a healthy growth across all product categories with the strongest being integrated mobile systems, which as a reminder, includes our integrated systems portfolio as well as mobile analog products like power management, Wi-Fi and GPS. It's worth noting that our broad markets product lines, which serve the connected home, networking, media, automotive and medical markets, grew at over 30% over the course of fiscal 2014, and that is significantly outpacing the broader semiconductor industry.", "For the fiscal year, we produced a total of $773 million in cash flow from operations, with free cash flow of $564 million. That's our second consecutive year with free cash flow yield of nearly 8%.", "Finally, our return on invested capital was 25% for fiscal 2014. That's over twice our weighted average cost of capital. During the fourth quarter, we closed the acquisition of Panasonic's Filter Division, paying $148.5 million for a 66% controlling interest with provisions to acquire the remaining 34% roughly 2 years from now. And we've now fully consolidated Panasonic's results in our financial statements. This venture makes Skyworks the performance leader in TC-SAW, with shipments approaching 100 million units per quarter, broadening our technology portfolio, enriching our systems capabilities and enhancing our financial returns.", "Turning to our first quarter 2015 business outlook, we expect revenue to be $770 million, our first quarter over a $3 billion annualized revenue run rate. We anticipate gross margin of 46.5% for Q1, and expect margins to continue to trend positively over the course of fiscal 2015, as we leverage a higher mix of integrated systems, improve volume utilization and realize the benefits of our joint venture with Panasonic. As a result, of all these positive factors, we now recommend modeling at 52% drop-through of incremental revenue to the gross profit line for the remainder of fiscal 2015 and beyond.", "We expect operating expenses to be approximately $94 million, which includes a full quarter of expenses from Panasonic. Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 13.5%. We expect our cash tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. And as a result, we expect the Q1 EPS of $1.18, using a base of 194 million shares. As Dave mentioned earlier, we raised our quarterly dividend payment to $0.13 per share. That's an increase of 18% and implies around 1% yield. Through the combination of our dividend plan and our ongoing share repurchase activity, we've returned roughly $200 million to shareholders over the course of fiscal 2014, representing 35% of our free cash flow. We continue to view an allocation of roughly 40% of free cash flow as an appropriate balance between internal investment for growth initiatives and shareholder returns.", "Many of the drivers of a strong 2015 are in place today. And that gives us a high level of confidence in our growth trajectory over the course of the year, putting us on a clear path towards $5 in annualized EPS.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on our market trends and growth strategy.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Don. Well, by all measures, we delivered a strong fiscal 2014, and that's a testament to the efforts of the entire Skyworks team. We're quite pleased with our financial performance, but I think more importantly, looking ahead, we see our track record of success continuing for the foreseeable future. And our corporate vision is very clear. We are enabling the global adoption of connectivity in all its forms, and across all applications and end markets. This powerful and secular mega trend is in the early innings, and it's spanning diverse markets like mobile, the connected home, media, computing, security, enterprise and networking across a number of communication protocols. These include 4G, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, GPS, Bluetooth and others. And as I outlined earlier, we have a threefold strategy in place to capitalize on these positive market trends.", "Now I'd like to take a moment to delve into each element of our strategy in just a bit more detail. First, harnessing the growth scale of mobile. Within the mobile device market, the combined impact of band proliferation and the adoption of advanced uplink architectures is causing a rapid shift away from discrete components and towards customized integrated solutions, which sweep in adjacent analog content. Customers are also increasingly focused on new ways to improve signal quality and download speeds, driving much more complex downlink architectures and creating entirely new growth avenues for us in the receive path. Now the net result is a rapidly expanding addressable market opportunities for Skyworks, significantly outpacing underlining unit growth with fewer qualified competitors.", "Second, cultivate the emergent Internet of things opportunity. We see numerous examples of connectivity expanding into entirely new device categories, including wearable electronics, security, lighting and automation opportunities across the connected home and enterprise. These all provide incremental new growth avenues for Skyworks technology and enhance our diversification. In fact, market analysts estimate that growth within the Internet of Things market will far exceed that of other connected devices over the next 5 years, some predicting as many as 50 billion connected devices by the year 2020.", "Third, we're aggressively expanding into new vertical markets. We're investing heavily to increase our market footprint in traditional analog segments like automotive, like medical and industrial. These are highly attractive markets characterized by longer product life cycles, far fewer competitors and higher margins. Skyworks participates in these markets by leveraging core analog and mixed signal design capabilities and a broad product catalog. As one example, in the September quarter, AT&T announced that it added more than 0.5 billion connected cars to its network, and predicted that there will be well over 10 million connected cars by the year 2017.", "We are winning numerous new content opportunities in the connected automobile today, not only in cellular and local-area connectivity, but also in telematics systems, infotainment, in navigation and climate control, collision avoidance, keyless entry and transponders. And in total, we're addressing well over $20 of content per car. We see these trends continue -- contributing to above-market growth for us in the foreseeable future. But equally important, we've established a solid track record of converting these strong top line growth trends into superior financial returns.", "In closing, we've created a unique business model combining strong consistent top line growth with the financial returns of best-in-class diversified analog company. And as our results show, we're delivering on that vision today.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's please open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will go to line of Rich Schafer with Oppenheimer.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "My first question is with front end or with mobile demand up so much of this year, do you guys see any constraints on growth now or as we look into 2015 for Skyworks? And as part of that answer, I'm curious what you're seeing on the pricing front as it relates to tighter supply.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Well, with respect to our ability to grow and growth constraints, we actually see today an expanding opportunity with our leading customers in smartphones. We talked a bit about it in the opening remarks, but we see increasing band count, more opportunities to lever our switching, levering now our new filter technologies and just a tremendous demand on the usage of mobile. So that's one side. And then broad markets, as we've outlined, we grew 30% year-over-year. We have tremendous traction now going in the IoT, early innings there. So we think the combination of our smartphone growth and then emerging markets within IoT and broad market categories will give us a great shot at additional growth into 2015.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. It doesn't sound like there's any constraints then, you don't see?", "Liam K. Griffin", "No.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And then my follow-up is just quickly, can you update us on your attach rate with China 4G reference designs? And I don't know if there is any way -- this might be a tough question, but is there any way to quantify sort of your average RF content in some of those local branded China phones?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Well, we have fortunately a balanced attack with respect to China. We have great partnerships with the leading global chipset providers. And we also do very well with some of the local brands like MediaTek and Spreadtrum. So we're seeing increasing attach there going from 3 mode to 5 mode phones. And so what you're seeing is a market that had been leveraged by 2G and low content, maybe $0.50, $0.60, moving to 3G, which is a 2x multiplier for us if not more. And now finally, 4G LTE rolling out and that's been a tremendous catalyst for us. And not only do we see the band count move up and our traditional amplifier and systems business go up, but we're seeing adjacent content and Wi-Fi power management and GPS, as these phones get richer and richer. So it's really important. And these are early innings for that upgrade cycle. So that's something we're going to see really play out into '15 and '16 as well.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley and Company.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Near-term question. Don, as we look at the guidance for the calendar fourth quarter up 7-ish percent quarter-on-quarter, what are some of the gives and takes as you look at the business across the power amplifier business, the broad market business and the multimode business?", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Well, thanks this is Dave. Thank you for the question. December is normally a very strong quarter for us, and that's certainly the case this year. We see -- the strength is very broad-based. It's across markets and it's across multiple applications. We are seeing an uptake of content-rich integrated mobile systems as these architectures get more and more complex. In fact, this was the highest growth segment for us last quarter. And I might add that we're seeing broad market business growth to be healthy in the December quarter and that was 30% up year-over-year last year. And of course, that's in a market that's up far less than that, perhaps single digits. We also -- I'd like to mention that we have a clearly stated goal to gain content in all flagship models with each successive model generation. And we've been successfully executing with higher and higher dollar content with each success of smartphone application.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "And then just a follow-up and it's related to comments in the press release. In the fourth quarter business highlights, numerous Smartwatch design wins, when would we expect revenues from that category to become material? And when it does, where will we see it? Will it be in the multi-markets group or will it be in another segment?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, Craig, this is Liam. We are seeing great traction in IoT, it's early innings as we've mentioned before. Some of the design wins we mentioned, for example, the GoPro camera. We have some new applications in automotive and wearable categories like watches. So a lot of these design wins will be -- some of them we'll be launching in the December quarter, but a lot of these will be 2015 through the year. And we expect to add to that roster, of course.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Harsh Kumar with Stephens.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Looking into the March quarter, can you remind us of seasonality? And are you thinking any differently about seasonality, given the strength in the September and December quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "It's a little early to provide specifics on March. Generally, the March quarter is down sequentially for the industry around 10%. We typically outperform, and that's a combination of our diversification efforts, which don't have the same market seasonality. And we are grabbing more analog content than existing mobile platforms. And share, in fact, is being consolidated across the industry; not only companies consolidating, but we're continuing to see more opportunities to bundle functionality and gain share through, if you will, industry consolidation around system providers, leaders like ourselves. So we expect March to be seasonal, but we also expect [indiscernible].", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "As my follow-on, I was hoping you could parcel out the impact of the extra week in terms of revenue in the September quarter?", "Donald W. Palette", "I will start with -- as far as the expenses, that's a good place to start. It was roughly around $2.5 million of expenses that we had. As far as revenue, we don't believe that had any material impact on the numbers because the focus is customer requirements and demands. And knowing ahead of time what that schedule was going to be, we were able to plan accordingly. So we don't believe it had any material impact from the top line, as far as where we ended up for the quarter.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum Capital.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Can you -- the $83 million you spent in CapEx this quarter, can you give us a sense of what your plans are for 2015? Are you missing or unable to land any further designs based on a lack of production? And then, lastly, Dave, I'd love to hear your views on your December guide, if you expect China to be up sequentially.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Tony, there's absolutely no issue as far as our ability to win share and grow based on having the right capacity. The hybrid model serves us quite well. When you see us spending CapEx and spending at the level is we have pretty good visibility to volume, and it's our goal to try and to keep that internal/external mix in line so that we get the right incremental margin answer. And that's the goal.", "David J. Aldrich", "Anthony, with respect to the December quarter in China, we have a great deal of experience in China. So we understand how to handicap that market. We're rather conservative in our guidance. We recognize there's historically been some volatility. But we see -- coming off a strong September quarter in China, we do see some growth in December. But more importantly, we're -- we believe we're at the beginning of a very early cycle of a very long upgrade cycle, multiyear. And as you know, we're highly diversified. We have a great position with the leading indigenous OEMs. We have an equally strong position with domestic brands, worldwide leaders that ship into China. And of course, if you look at the market leaders, the chipset providers, we have majority share with, really, the 2 or 3 leaders there. So we're well-positioned. We expect December to be up somewhat, and we think we've been very conservative in our guidance.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And I think you guys have done so well for so long that investors always want more, and they want to know what will take Skyworks to the next level. And specifically, as part of that, what is the company's M&A strategy to diversify the business away from mobile? So Dave, my question really is do you see enough growth within mobile? And then, what is the M&A strategy? Is that even important to think about now? Because you have been talking about it for some time, but we have not seen any follow-through on that. So just conceptually, how you think about the company and how you take it to the next level from here?", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Well, that's a lot of question, but thank you. If I look at '15 and beyond, we see a number of positive dynamics. And we're -- we think, we're very uniquely and strongly positioned. First, we're going to continue to see big content gains in mobile and in connectivity, particularly in 4G and 11ac. We see a smaller number of competitors, as I said earlier, a lot of industry consolidation and huge advantage from -- to local -- from discrete component providers to system providers because we are very broad in analog and RF domain. Our customer see the benefit of that, and we're obviously able to sweep in more and more content. And all of these factors, we think, play into future growth. And incidentally what we continue to double down in these vertical markets, we're excited by them. We're seeing growth in far and excess of the market, and all that's organic. But from an M&A standpoint, we did just close the Panasonic acquisition. So we have been active. We've been very selective, however. So we have -- it's part of our capital allocation strategy that Don mentioned. We have a high hurdle rate for M&A. It needs to be accretive to our EPS, our margins and accelerate diversification. So we're very active, but we're going to be very selective and look for the right deal. In the meantime, we have very strong organic opportunities.", "Donald W. Palette", "And Vivek, just to put a color on. I mean, we have spent over $700 million over the last 3 or 4 years on multiple acquisitions. So we have been able to pay cash for those. So we have been active in the market.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And then, as a follow-up, just a little more short-term question. You've had very good control on the spending side. You're also guiding to the 52% fall-through on the gross margin. Just wondering, Don, how we should think about the OpEx trajectory. And importantly, your OpEx is among the lowest, right, OpEx as a percentage of sales is among the lowest in the industry. I assume, you are spending where the spending is required, but how should we think about a business model that can sort of support the growth that you're looking forward to in 2015?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, we've talked to you about improving the margin drop-through, and that's a result of the focus we have and the things you need to do to expand margins, and that's the spending the CapEx and focus on yields and productivity. And then, what we're also seeing is we're getting this move from our power amplifiers -- standalone power amplifier business, the integrated mobile systems. That's going to continue to expand our margin. And that's a lot of what you can see. Plus, we've got a nice bump going forward now with the Filter acquisition and not stacking those margins anymore. So all that's going to continue to grow the margin, which is going to help the model. We will continue to grow OpEx and make investments that we believe are going to add value to shareholders. So we just guided to $94 million. I would say for modeling, you can add a $1.5 million a quarter is probably a good number. Could it go up a little bit here or there or maybe down? Absolutely. That's just a rule of thumb. But we'll continue to make the investments that we think are going to enable us to grow, to outperform the market. So we're very confident we can do that. And I think we have a track record of doing that, given our expense profile.", "Operator", "And then, we'll go to line of Sid Sinha with Canaccord Genuity.", "Siddharth Sinha - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "A quick question on the Android ecosystem. We\u2019re seeing share shifts from the leading Android OEMs towards the Chinese OEMs. I just want to see, longer-term these share shifts, what kind of implications they have on Skyworks sales into this market?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Well, our position in the market really is operating-system agnostic, so to speak. We certainly, we partner with the leaders and we also partner with a broad set of end customers and chipset partners. So our business in China, as Dave outlined, has been strong. We are very well diversified. We're also seeing, fortunately, a lot of the China brands move into additional emerging markets like India, like Latin America, which creates a second level. So the operating system environment doesn't change that much in terms of what we offer. We are -- with respect to chipsets, we have a strong position with partners like Qualcomm. We have a very good position with MediaTek. We're excited about their LTE launches. We have position with more of the true local brands in China like Spreadtrum. So I think we're -- we've got our bases covered with respect to that. And we have quite a bit of revenue in the Android ecosystem as well.", "Siddharth Sinha - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Just as a follow-up, a lot of focus on integrated mobile systems and on the SkyOne family. This portfolio has other products, too, like pads, transmit modules, et cetera. So within the integrated mobile systems portfolio, what would you say is the fastest-growing component of that business? And would it be fair to assume that pads are still the largest piece of that business?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Well, I mean, by definition, it really is a systems based portfolio. So there are elements of pads. We also have some very, very interesting devices that don't have any amplifiers in terms of transmit chain. We have diversity of receive technology. We have highly advanced Wi-Fi and GPS technology that are often woven together into system solutions. The pad portfolio is exciting for us. We've done a lot of innovative things. We are now able to leverage our temp comp assets with Panasonic. I think that's not only helping us win new business, but really, as Don outlined, giving us a bit of room in margins as well. So we're excited about that. And I think you should expect more and more from us when you look at some of these new bands and frequencies that we've been talking about.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I'd add, we're seeing a very high attach rate in addition to SkyOne and pads, a very high attach rate with our Wi-Fi solutions with our power management and our lighting and display. So as I mentioned earlier, we've moved the business kind of from a transmit module into transmit filtering, advanced switching, and then capturing more and more of the overall content. And by virtue of our system sell and the relationships we have with many of our customers, we're able to sell the entire footprint, increasingly selling the entire footprint.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I'm wondering now that the full year is complete, if you can give us an idea of what you're greater-than-10% customer mix looks like. And as we roll forward here with the strength in China, are some of these Chinese OEMs getting large enough, such that your customer concentration risk is going down? Or do you think rolling forward here, it roughly remains the same?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Alex. I'll just give you the -- I mean, we haven't published it yet, but it's -- there were 2. There'll be 2 top-10% customers for '14, and that's Foxconn and Samsung.", "David J. Aldrich", "And we are -- you're absolutely -- I think the nature of your question is spot on. We are seeing more diversification as these indigenous OEMs within China -- which we're selling to all, virtually all of them. As they continue to increase their market share, we're seeing more and more customer diversification, and as we continue to sweep in more content, we're seeing more technology and product diversification within those customers.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And as a follow-on with regard to the product diversification, you mentioned mobile payments. It caught me by surprise there. I'm kind of wondering what you're attachment is to mobile payments. And then also, you seem incrementally more upbeat on Bluetooth, ZigBee, Internet of Things, while at the same time, your gross margin profile is looking very strong. Can you help me understand how defensible you see those Internet of Things applications and what those means to your gross margin profile?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I think mobile -- I'll tag team this with Liam. I think mobile payments was really just for us an example, kind of the ecosystem and following the money and what's driving more of the need for performance and the need for more investment in mobility, both through the Internet of Things, mobile devices as well as the infrastructure. So it's just another driver behind -- that validates the economics of having high-performance mobile devices.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, exactly. And I think, as we go forward, Alex, you see things like GPS technology becomes part of mobile payments. But the real theme here is just the richness of content and kind of the user-model changing to the point where a smartphone is a must-have device. It represents an enterprise device. It's a device for e-commerce. It's a device that fuels many of the social media companies with their advertising dollar. So it's our job to make those products better and faster. And with our OEMs and our relations with chipset providers, we have very good insight into what the next-generation architectures look like, and fortunately, it dovetails quite well with our R&D investments.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Dave, just wanted to ask, a very strong second half, I think, driven by broad markets increasing content in some of the major smartphone platforms. But on the smartphone ramp, as you look at customer forecasts, have you seen any indications that might suggest that the smartphone guys are building the inventory here ahead of year end, and that could come back and cause, perhaps, greater-than-normal seasonality in the March quarter? Or do you think that these guys are selling about as -- they're selling them as fast as they can build them?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, that's a great question. Let me answer it from inventory visibility since we ship to virtually everybody, and we look at the sell-in and sell-through of our distribution partners, contract manufacturers and the like. And it's very lean, very lean in the component channel and in the chipset inventory channel. So there is no -- at that tactical level there is no evidence at all that anything is being built in excess. We also look at the -- and we constantly look at the inputs we're getting from our customers and try to handicap those to be realistic with sell-through from the carrier. We think we've got that right. And we do -- when I've mentioned earlier that we model, particularly emerging markets, China specifically, conservatively, that's what I mean. We handicap all those inputs. And then we try to come up with kind of a common denominator that make sense to us, given sell-through at the carrier level, and I think we're going to be fine.", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then just for Don, you raised incremental gross margin to 52%. Wondering is that really just a fiscal '15 phenomena as you bring in the Panasonic JV and you no longer have to share the margins? Or is 52%, is that a good level to use beyond fiscal '15?", "Donald W. Palette", "No, that's -- we're telling you to model that for your foreseeable future. I don't know how many years you're modeling out. But it's absolutely -- part of it's Panasonic, but also this mix shift. And it\u2019s also, when you look at more and more systems complexity that's being -- the complexity of the phones, our ability to design and win share with the right systems, all that has accretive margins. So that's really what you're seeing in '15 and beyond. So 52% is the number to use in your models, it's not just a 1-year phenomena.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, it's real simple. Less discrete PAs. More integrated mobile within our mobile business and then, more vertical markets and broad markets which have longer product life cycles and consistently higher margins.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I had a question. So you're obviously growing 28% year-over-year, good growth. But as you look at 2015 with a quantum growth with LTE and receive side integration, what's the dollar content opportunity you see on LTE-Advanced versus LTE?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Well, we are seeing -- just to kind of backtrack a bit, as I outlined before, 2G to 3G in China could represent $1.50 incremental for us. When you get into 4G, you have opportunities, whether it's 3 mode 5 mode, to go into the $3 to $4 range. And some of the richer global Tier 1s, those numbers are 2xed. So we see in a high-volume kind of diversified opportunity in China, which we talked about, lot of good opportunities there. We're getting design wins. We're laying it out with our amplifier technologies, our system technology switching, GPS, all of those devices and technologies we mentioned. But with a larger global Tier 1 we saw -- again, there's a tremendous reach there that we can see. So we see the opportunity to grow share and continue on a growth rate consistent with what we've outlined.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And as you look out, where are you adding capacity? And actually the top line is growing so fast, do you still intend to keep capacity flexible there with the foundry?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, part of the reason that we're ramping capacity is based on market demand and our visibility to that demand. Vijay, what we always try to do is we try to balance the hybrid model. So that when we're adding capacity, again, we're trying to keep that mix between what we outsource and what we manufacture ourselves at the right kind of percentages that gives us the best answer. So that's what you're seeing when we're expanding the capacity.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Don, how much revenue is Panasonic in the December guide? Are we talking 10 to 15 or more than that?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, less than that. About $1.5 million.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Okay. Great. And then, in terms of capacity, how do you feel about your TC-SAW capacity at Panasonic now? How much of the CapEx that you announced would be going into the filter fab versus GaAS? And are you selling the product outside of the company or are you consuming it all internally? And then Dave, is the use of debt off the table for acquisitions or it is something you'd consider?", "Donald W. Palette", "I'll start, Ed, with the CapEx question. And while we haven't specifically guided CapEx, again, any CapEx level for 2015 is going to be based on the demand that we see. So we would expect it to probably be at a level similar to '14. And there will be a piece of that, that's tied to CapEx for filter expansion. So it's going to be a part of that. Very little to date, obviously, we just closed the transaction, but it's going to be a piece of that in Q1 and Q2 of 2015.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. Let me just add to that, to Don's comments. And we see the appetite for our TC technology to be incredible. I mean, we're very pleased with what we've seen so far with this JV. And when we look at designs that will launch this time next year, we fully expect additional TC content and expanding customers.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Liam, is all that appetite inside? Or do you have -- are us selling it on the outside yet and do you plan to?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Well, for the most part, we're looking at TC as a enabler for some of our system solutions. If opportunities come out, outside of that, that's a potential. But right now we're focused on the higher-end, higher-grade, performance-rich integrated systems.", "Donald W. Palette", "And just, Ed, as a comment on the revenue. That's why, when you're modeling us going forward, that $1.5 million at that, our contractual requirements are done, and so for the rest of '15, at this point, we are assuming it's all internal. There's no external revenue.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to Mike Burton with Brean Capital.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "First on SkyOne, I was wondering if you could give us some progress on SkyOne. How many customers like this, where the good competition is? And how big can this integrated approach become as a percent of industry designs or percent of Skyworks revenues? And what kind of impact would that have on Skyworks' growth and operating margin?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Well SkyOne, as we exited Q4, we now have 7 platforms in production with SkyOne today. So that number has moved up through the year, and it will continue to grow into 2015. And Mike, as we've talked about in the past, and if you think of SkyOne as a platform approach, it's highly configurable and customizable. We are seeing an increasing appetite for integrated systems across our customer base. So this type of solution has really worked well. And again, we think of that flexibility, and our applications and engineering teams work to truly configure a device that works for a specific customer; one-at-a-time has been a real differentiator for us, and we expect it to grow into '15. And back to our last comment, technologies like TC-SAW now will be readily available for us to populate SkyOne. And I think that, that's been missing link in some cases, and it takes us to the next level of performance. We're excited about that opportunity, which we should see, again, for several years to come.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the margins on SkyOne? And then also, you mentioned broad-based strength in both the preliminary September results and now for the December guidance. I believe you generally see an inventory correction at your largest Korean customer. Can you confirm if both of your 10% customers were up in September, and your outlook for them in December?", "David J. Aldrich", "They were both up in September quarter, and we expect an increase in December quarter as well.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, and we've -- as Dave outlined, comments about handicapping the outlook, I mean, that goes for all of our customers. We don't anticipate any impact of inventory connection with any of our lead customers.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I was on a couple of calls, so I apologize if I ask something that was asked already. One of the things you mentioned in your press release was, I think, on 802.11ac going to something like 9 streams. And I was hoping you could lay out for us what that opportunity looks like in terms of dollar content, in the same way that you might say from a 3G phone to 4G, you're doubling dollar content. How many of the routers you've shipped to so far are sort of older lower stream count? How many are higher? And what's that sort of jump there?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Steve, yes, I mean, so what you're seeing now is 11ac is a technology that rapidly expands data rates. You're seeing it in routers and you're now seeing it in smartphones and tablets. For us, what it is, it's a MIMO technology: multiple in/multiple out. So actually you can triple or 6x or 9x the number of streams. So there are devices today that we've noted, design wins that have just launched into production that are now available in some of the retail stores that have Skyworks content that can go to $6 to $8. It's a big part of our story now in Wi-Fi. These are solid margin, above-corporate-average accretive margin parts. And the 11ac access point market is still in its infancy, so that's an upgrade cycle that will go on for years. We're going to benefit from that.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Perfect. And then, as I look at pricing in the industry, obviously you're talking about much better margins here, and even some of your competitors are looking at much better margins. As I look at pricing, can you talk a little bit about what that might have looked like historically, as you had more intense competition. Was it -- you'd see 10% annual price declines? And how that looks as we move more to a SkyOne solution, where it seems like that would be more of just a custom win versus any really price competition?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes. I can give you that. Historically, we run usually anywhere from 7% to 8% on an annual basis. And I think -- I'll let Liam talk to the systems. It's certainly going to be below that on the integrated systems piece.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes -- no, absolutely. I mean, I think, clearly, moving to these integrated solutions, they are not replaceable and they're not commodities. I mean, they're far from it. And I think customers value not only the device itself, but our ability to architect these solutions, uniquely wrap it up with technical support, just a complete sale and engagement. And I think we've seen our ASPs benefit from this.", "Donald W. Palette", "And Steve, to your point, the one thing is that, when you talk about competitors' margins and the increase we just guided to and the increase increment, it just points to a much healthier overall market dynamic that you're seeing.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy.", "JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC", "Just one more follow-up question, really, on that pricing issue. As you go to integrated, you're replacing discrete parts. Does the combined trade-off leave you with higher content? Or is it more that you may sacrifice a bit of content, but you have a much stronger position because those are harder to replace? How do you see that moving forward as the industry has become more consolidated?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, thank you. The way to think about it is that if you look at the band count, if you look at these complex switching architectures and so on, what we're able to do is we're able to consistently add more content. So our ASP per phone in each successive model over the last few years, and projected in the next few years, is going up. But we're providing a lot more functionality. So the play for Skyworks is that we see fewer competitors competing for components because our customers aren't sourcing their architectures that way. They're looking for a system. So we were able to, first, facilitate more bands, more complexity, more switch arms and so on, get more dollar content while providing a great deal more value to the customer. And then, as we're architecting the system in the transmit side, we move to the receive side. We sweep in Wi-Fi. We sweep in lighting and display, buck-boost type power management devices, and the entire performance of the system becomes highly dependent on Skyworks and the overall system becomes very sticky to the customer.", "JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC", "Great, that's helpful. And then that's leading into the follow-up question. So clearly, winning a lot of analog parts in the smartphone or in wireless equipment. Can you separate out and describe your strategy and your opportunity right now, your size of opportunity for analog beyond those things connected to mobility, whether it's on the equipment side or on the device side? And what your strategy is going forward to that perhaps diversify in that direction?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, JoAnne. Yes, I mean, we do have our growing analog portfolio in markets like infrastructure. Okay. So we're seeing a rollout, specifically in China right now, with Huawei and LTE building out the wireless infrastructure ecosystem that's supporting all this data that we been talking about. So that's one market. We're looking at markets and now have design wins in automotive. We think that's a real attractive market for Skyworks. We have a lot of technology that's applicable and we're starting to win. We have a little bit of business in military and avionics, and so those are markets that we're going to continue to pursue. And the benefit for us is that core analog technology is scalable. It doesn't require a whole reinventing of the wheel for us to participate, and we're starting to see more and more leverage with what we've already done and what we've learned in our traditional markets and bringing that to the next level of verticals.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, thank you very much, everyone, for participating today.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Ferranti, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti ", "Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Second Fiscal Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with the business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions. ", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings. ", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP. ", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report another strong performance for our second fiscal quarter 2012, in which we exceeded prior guidance, and we outpaced seasonal trends. Our second quarter results demonstrate how our diversification strategy, our flexible business model and ongoing focus on operational execution contributed to healthy financial returns in the seasonal trough, but more importantly, positioned us to outperform through the remainder of the year. ", "Specifically during the second quarter, we posted revenue of $365 million. That's ahead of our guidance of $360 million and is up 12% year-over-year. We maintained best-in-class margins, producing second quarter operating income of $84 million. We earned $0.42 in diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.02 better than our guidance. And we generated cash flow from operations of $117 million. ", "And looking back at the first half of our fiscal year, despite a product transition at one of our key customers and despite March quarter seasonality, we maintained strong profitability, producing a cumulative $189 million in operating income, we earned a combined $0.92 in diluted earnings per share, and we produced $194 million in cash flow from operations. These accomplishments demonstrate Skyworks' differentiation and highlight the sustainability of our business model. And we see our momentum strengthening in the current June quarter and accelerating in the September quarter based on strong first half design win activity and a robust opportunity pipeline. ", "At a higher level, the global megatrends of mobile computing and ubiquitous connectivity will provide powerful growth engines for Skyworks in the coming years and are fundamentally reshaping the world around us. As an example, wireless is becoming the next strategic pipe for content delivery. Upcoming smartphone and tablet platforms feature multi-core processing, high-definition displays and lightning-fast data speeds, making them the ideal third screen for consumers and blurring the traditional boundaries between televisions, PCs and mobile devices. ", "Cloud-based services are expanding at an incredible pace. Content providers like Google, like Microsoft, HBO, Amazon and many others are building out massive libraries of cloud-based on-demand content. And the result is an exploding demand to be connected to the cloud. ", "And also, mobile is displacing landline broadband. Today, the capabilities of LTE can exceed equivalent wireless services like DSL to a point where mobile broadband is becoming a viable alternative to wireline. This is especially the case within the emerging markets where virtually all of the growth in new broadband subscriptions is from mobile devices. These megatrends are in the early stages, and they'll play out in the span of the next decade. But there is some very tangible offshoots that were strengthen -- that we see strengthening our business today. ", "During 2012, LTE devices will hit critical mass. A recent forecast by Strategy Analytics suggests that LTE shipments could grow by nearly ten-fold in 2012. As demand for global roaming expands, smartphones and tablets that incorporate only 1 or 2 regional LTE bands will begin to adopt additional LTE frequency, along with full backward compatibility to 3G and to 2G. Also during 2012, smartphone adoption will skyrocket in developing countries. According to recent market research, smartphone growth in China and India could nearly double this year and approach 200 million units. The embedded base of 2G subscribers is tremendous, creating a massive upgrade cycle that will play out over the next few years. ", "And finally, wireless connectivity will expand into even more consumer devices. By 2016, analysts forecast that there will be over 10 billion connected devices. Wireless attach rates are exploding in traditionally unconnected devices like gaming platforms, like televisions, appliances, set-top boxes and many others. ", "So as an enabler of wireless connectivity in all its forms, Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends. We see all of these driving substantial growth in our TAM, driven primarily by 3 factors. First, the average dollar content will continue to rise within our RF front-end market. As smartphones replace feature phones, our core TAM will grow at around a 15% compounded rate, as band count and complexity rise with the adoption of new LTE bands. Second, on top of all this, we are capturing incremental -- the incremental new dollar content within mobile devices with our growing portfolio of antenna switch modules or ASMs, wireless networking front-end solutions, a GPS low-noise amplifiers, and now power management and display and backlighting solutions. And I think it's worth noting that none of these products were in our portfolio just 18 months ago. In fact, today, we find ourselves pursuing as many as 7 or more addressable sockets per device as compared to 1 or 2 PA sockets just a couple of years ago.", "And finally, we're leveraging the core competencies from our mobile segment to expand into entirely new high-margin vertical markets. For example, within our high performance analog products, we're seeing a tremendous amount of activity in wireless networking and wireless networking solutions. Wireless connectivity is becoming a critical link to access content in the cloud or to stream video and other rich media content. And next-generation technologies, like 802.11ac, utilize multiple transmit and receive chains, dramatically ratcheting up RF complexity. Much like the cellular market, performance requirements are becoming more critical, complexity is going up and overall RF dollar content is rising. ", "And Skyworks has established a strong early-mover leadership position, and we've already secured over 20 design wins across a variety of 802.11ac-enabled devices including routers, set-top boxes, netbook PCs, USB dongles and others. And we expect to begin high-volume product shipments later this year in support of late 2012 product launches. ", "Okay, now, turning to our second quarter in our mobile internet business, we secured new design wins on Samsung's Galaxy S3 platform with an entire suite of Skyworks products. This include multi-mode transmit modules that include high-efficiency LTE amplifiers, wireless LAN front-end, GPS LNAs, antenna switch modules and power management products. In addition, during quarter, we captured new socket wins on a host of new smartphone and tablet platforms from Huawei including the LTE-enabled MediaPad and Ascend smartphone lineup. We ramped our integrated multi-mode engine on the HTC 1 smartphone platform. ", "And finally, we entered into high-volume production with our SkyHi family of ultrahigh-efficiency amplifiers in support of several major platform launches for 2012. These are the highest efficiency amplifiers in the market today, and we're seeing tremendous design and activity across our customer base. ", "Now within our high-performance analog business, we captured new design wins in the quarter across a number of very diverse applications. These include connectivity sockets in Sony's high-end gaming platform, custom switch modules in a military avionics applications for ITT systems, a 16-channel backlighting controller for high-definition LED televisions from LG and others, a next-generation leadless implantable defibrillators with our portfolio of optocouplers, and remote gas meter reading solutions with Aclara. Increasingly across all of our markets, we see a narrower pool of competitors with the engineering capabilities and the full technology portfolio of Skyworks. Looking ahead, we see this trend accelerating. With the advent of more sophisticated RF signal processing and more complex modulation requirements to support higher and higher data rates. ", "So in closing, our second quarter marked another strong performance for Skyworks. We believe that our strategy of continuing to diversify our business, expanding into new vertical markets, while maintaining a laser focus on operational execution, is clearly working. ", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Don for his financial review.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us, everyone, today. I'll first provide a summary of our second quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. ", "Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $364.7 million. That's up 12% year-over-year. Gross profit was $157.5 million or 43.2% of revenue. Operating expenses were $73.7 million, consisting of R&D expense of $45.4 million and SG&A expense of $28.2 million, which yielded $83.9 million of operating income and a 23% operating margin. ", "Cash taxes were $3.8 million, translating into a 4.5% tax rate, slightly better than our prior guidance. Net income was $79.8 million or $0.42 of diluted earnings per share, $0.02 better than our guidance, including a $0.01 tax benefit. ", "Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We generated $117 million in cash flow from operations. We invested $26 million in capital expenditures and had depreciation of $18 million. We expect capital expenditures to remain above depreciation levels through the remainder of fiscal 2012 as we increase capacity across all of our facilities in preparation for second half product ramps. These investments -- these CapEx investments consist of equipment add-ons within our existing facilities which have a very quick payback. That expands our product margins and our return on invested capital. And finally, we exited the quarter with $307.3 million in cash. ", "I wanted to briefly highlight for you how the strength of our business model has translated into strong earnings and cash flow, and that's enabled us to significantly improve our balance sheet and capital structure. Since the beginning of fiscal 2011, we've generated a cumulative $560 million in cash flow from operations. We retired the remainder of our convertible debt in favorable terms and without any equity dilution. That makes us debt-free for the first time in Skyworks' history. We completed strategic all-cash acquisitions, which significantly expanded our addressable markets, and we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price in the low $20 range. ", "Now for our third quarter 2012 business outlook. We are guiding third quarter revenue to be a 5% sequentially. So assuming revenue of $383 million, we suggest modeling gross margin in the 43.5% range. Looking ahead, we do see gross margins continue to improve as revenue growth accelerates through the remainder of the year and as we realize synergies associated with our recent acquisitions. We expect third quarter operating expense to be roughly $76 million. Below the line, we expect $300,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses. And we now expect our cash tax rate to be around 7% for the remainder of fiscal 2012. And as a result, we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $0.44, and that's on a base of 192 million shares. ", "So that concludes the prepared remarks. So, operator, why don't you go ahead and open up the line for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "The first question is there has been -- I mean, there had been some shortages of baseband from Qualcomm on 28-nanometer products. Just wondering if that shortage has impacted your results or the outlook for the next quarter, and by how much.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Parag. This is Dave. We have seen some demand pushout based on shortages. It's been factored into our June guidance. And I'll just add that diversification in our end markets and diversification among the -- our customer set within our mobile business is helping us -- it always helps us to minimize the impact of these kinds of swings. But it's all been factored into what we talked about in our Q3 guidance.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay fair enough. And the second question is that you are leaded to a strong second half starting from the September quarter. Just I'm not asking for a specific guidance, but do you think the strengths in your business will be better than seasonality in the second half?", "David J. Aldrich", "I do, and it's really driven by specific program ramps across both our high-performance analog and our mobile business.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Anne Edelstein", "It's Anne Edelstein calling in on Vivek's behalf. We just had some questions about your diversification strategy. It seems like you guys did a good job with that last quarter. We were wondering how exactly your strategy is going to change as the top 2 players, Apple and Samsung, continue to concentrate smartphone handset customers, and as your competitors seem to steadily gain share at those platforms, how you can differentiate yourself?", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay well, that's a pretty broad question. Let me kind of break it up a little bit. The way we are able to deal with customer concentration is the best way possible, which is to try to be a strategic partner and aligned with all of the customers, with all the major customers. We've done a very good job of being able to do that. Furthermore, we focus on our chipset and baseband partners. And by being lined out with virtually every chipset in the market today, we are able to address those swings. So as OEMs look to bring forth a new platform and they begin with a reference design, we're on that reference design, and we're well positioned with their chipset partners. So I think those 2 things allow us to be as diversified as one can be within the mobile business. It has some inherent concentration. Beyond that, we look to diversify into new markets. Logically, we have a high-end performance analog business. We have a strong, robust catalog business, so we're able to address markets like wireless infrastructure, automotive, we talked today about medical, so we have a diverse set of markets we address, which also gives us an opportunity to have less volatility.", "Anne Edelstein", "Okay. And then can you just tell us how many, and if so, which ones are your 10% customers, 10% or greater, and if any of them are over 20%?", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure, Anne. We had 3 10% customers for the quarter, and they were Foxconn, Samsung and Nokia. And -- but we don't break it out beyond who is the top 10% customers in a quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question Blayne Curtis with Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Maybe just for reference, if you could just, in the March quarter, breakout RF and linear. And then when you look at the strength you're seeing in June, I mean, clearly, one of your competitors had a customer that was down in June. You seemed to be able to offset that. Any color on where your offsets are coming from would be helpful.", "Donald W. Palette", "Blayne, I'll just take the housekeeping question first. The -- for the quarter, we were at 35% linear HPA and 65% handset smartphone, which is consistent with the percentage we were at last quarter. There really wasn't a change in it.", "David J. Aldrich", "And to explain the second part of your question, we're seeing some strength in our Korean customer base, we're seeing strength with some of our Chinese customers like Huawei, our HPA portfolio is performing very well, the catalog business is strong, and we're seeing WiFi and some of the connect rate with gaming and some of the home automation markets doing very well for us. It's a combination of those things.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then maybe just following up on the WiFi, I mean, you highlighted 802.11ac. You talked about late year ramps. I was wondering if you could just frame -- I know it's a high content, maybe just from the unit opportunities this year, and next is sort of the adoption curve there.", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure. Yes, I think this year, we have right now, just to give you a little bit of a backdrop, we have a very strong position with the leading chipset provider, and by virtue of that, have a fairly strong insight into the OEMs and the ramp that we'll see late 2012 and into 2013. So we believe that's going to be a pretty aggressive phase in. We're bringing ac up in 11, and we'll roll out. You see gigabit speed with 11ac, you see MIMO, we have literally multiple screens, so you'd double or triple your RF content. We see that playing out late 2012 as a ramp and then into 2013 and beyond. We're really excited about it. And as I said, we have very good visibility into the chipset in the OEM side.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk about your Nokia exposure, that it's greater than 10%, how is that revenue trending for you? I know you can't get into too much detail, but with regard to the upgrade cycles with some of the legacy exposure, how should we think about that as a risk factor for you or an opportunity?", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Alex. Liam?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Certainly, Nokia, as Don indicated, are 10% customer for us, and we have a very broad footprint from 3G, very high-end, even LTE-enabled phones, and in this year, down to the lower-end 2G business. We continue to work very hard to gain share. I think one of the things that you should expect from us, as we get into 2013, is to go beyond the power amplifier space. We're currently working with them on GPS products. We have a great opportunity for the antenna switch modules. And quite frankly, the power management IP that we bring forth today could be a real driver for us into 2013.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think, just to add onto that, Alex, it really is, again, part of our diversions -- our diversification strategy. Nokia has been a great customer of ours. They build a lot of phones. And as we see, shares move and the strategy has changed. We just always want to make sure that as we see our OEM share shifts, we're there to address the entire base, and we do a pretty good job with that.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Yes and a follow-up on that, could I ask -- you mentioned Huawei earlier. Are there any other players getting close to that 10% mark? I know HTC has been important to you, Huawei, how are those second tranche customers doing? Anybody knocking on the door at 10%?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. Huawei and ZTE both -- they're not 10% customers, but I think that they are really the big guns that they are in, in China, of course. And what we like is, unlike some of the challenges that you see with 2G business in open-market China, Huawei and ZTE really have been playing up with 3G and LTE ramps. We also like the infrastructure opportunities there. As you start to see subscribers increase in China, more smartphone adoption, and that's predicated now by our ramp in infrastructure. We play there as well, so that's the story we like.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the either 2011 ac activity that you're seeing. Liam, when we look at applications like notebooks or home routers or dongles for TVs, how should we think about the dollar content for Skyworks in those types of applications?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Craig, thanks. Well, we actually are seeing a couple of  things. First of all, on a unit-per-unit basis, the 11ac product is much more complex. You're driving 256K QAM versus 64K. The channel bandwidth virtually doubles versus 11n. So on a part-by-part basis, this is a more complex device, higher ASP, higher value. But now when you bring in MIMO, multiple in/multiple out, you could take 2, 3 or 4 screens. So you have an individual power increase, and then you have the multiplication factor of MIMO. So this is a substantial TAM pop for us.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And can you put any numbers to that, Liam? Is it from $1 to $2 up to mid-single digits or any further quantification there?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. I mean, it's certainly a multiple of 2x to 3x what you'd see in 11n.", "David J. Aldrich", "And in the routers -- in the MIMO routers, the dollars are huge.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes the dollars are huge because that's certainly you want a screen, and you also look at extended range. So we're really pleased by it. And I will say that we've had the benefit of early engagement with the leading chipset provider, and that's put us in a great leadership position.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then just related to that business, but at a higher level, for Don perhaps, as you look at the deals that you've done, how do you look at the integration progress and any positive or negative surprises now that we've got 2.5 to 3 quarters of SiGe underneath the belt and a fourth quarter of AATI underneath?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, Craig, this is Liam. With respect to the integration with both of these franchises, we're very pleased with what we've seen. Certainly, SiGe we've had under our wing here for a little more time. And I think what you're seeing now is the benefit of our customer engagements, the Skyworks sales force and the relationships we forged. With AATI, we love the product, we love the technology, and I think you're going to start to see real benefits again as we roll that out to Tier 1 accounts that had not been addressed in the past.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes so I think and when you think of it, Craig, it's a timing thing. And as Liam said, SiGe, we've just had to integrate it longer, so we're starting to look [ph] at the benefits curve a little faster. But we fully expect AATI to be there as well. This is just a question of timing, but they're going very, very well. They're very -- going very, very well.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. Maybe, Liam, if you could talk about the China market a little bit more in detail. We've been hearing that, of course, the 2G market, there has been a pricing war between all these guys. But trying to get a sense of how you view the 2G market going forward in China. Is that a market you want to continue to play in? And how do you think pricing will look like? Secondly, in terms of 3G, can you give us a sense of how we should think about the 3G market for you guys in China market share-wise and in pricing?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Yes, the 2G market in China, as we indicated earlier, it's really a very broad open market portfolio of small OEMs and a number of chipset providers. We have a very good position there. We had been a partner with MediaTek for quite some time. But that portfolio now, in general, as the market is compressed, the ASPs have come in a little bit, and the overall share of China's overall demand is lessened in 2G. Now having said that, we are excited with the 3G ramp. We're starting to see that being led by the 2 main players I mentioned before, Huawei and ZTE. We have a very good position there. They tend to use chipset and baseband providers that we know well. Very often, we lead with a reference design. And those accounts are also more willing to leverage the complexity and the value and add additional components, ASMs, et cetera.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I'd add to that, that we have -- we've established a product lineup, everything from CMOS devices, an acquisition we did a couple of years ago with ultra low-cost, and it's very high-performance, very low-cost HPT devices for the next tier of that 2G market. And so the way we think about this is, while the ASP pressure has been felt in that part of the market, we are convinced that we have by far the lowest cost structure, we have the scale, and we've got the right -- and positioned on the right reference design. So for us, it's points of market share, and we leveraged that volume to continue to drive down the cost curve in our factories and drive our utilization higher. So we like that business, but we're careful with it to make sure that it continues to have a positive contribution and that we maintain our overall worldwide market share because that's very important to us.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Can you give us -- I want -- Dave, I want to go back into your comments about TAM. Just started going through the 3, 4 opportunities that you see ahead for yourself. And you've talked about, if I'm not mistaken, the opportunity in your core cellular business of 15% CAGR. Correct me if I'm wrong.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, no, you're right. You're right, Ittai.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "If we layer that in, and assuming that we add the other things that you've talked about, which are the antenna switch modules, GPS LNAs, displays, power, and also the 802.11, like the high-margin markets that you've talked about, is that the assumption we need to take, that your business starting 2013 and thereafter will grow north than 15%? Is that the conclusion here?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I'll say it a little bit differently. The market is going to grow for the core RF TAM by more than 15%, and as you know, we've been very clear that we intend to gain share. And so, that 15%, by the way, is looking at the -- looking at multiple bands of amplification, it's looking at the complicated switching and conditioning and filtering that occurs, that needs to occur, and fortunately, for us, all that complexity is creating real problems with size, with shielding, with interference. And so we've spent a great deal of time and effort working with our customers to solve those problems for them. And as a result, we were able to, not only take points in share, but really work through a real issue that they have right now which is hitting the current consumption battery talk time with all of this -- as they try to add more functionality into these devices. And so it's really a great time for us.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "So in short, is that a yes?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And, Don, it's been a while since you've kind of -- you've gone through the 2 acquisitions in the last couple of quarters. Clearly, you've been working internally to strengthen those out, as they say. But can you give us a little bit more color now, and have you given some thought on how do you think then longer-term your margin profile needs to look like? And now with the addition of these 2 businesses, what are sort of like the margin profile we need to think about, let's say, 24 months out, that is something aspirational?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, clearly that there's been no change in our aspiration to have a 30% operating model. That's still where we're focused. And the best way for you is to step back and look at our businesses. We're still -- and we've talked about this a lot, we're still dropping through our incremental revenue on a gross margin line 48% to 50%. So you start with that. Okay, we are going to be making some targeted investments in OpEx in future opportunities. You see that in our Q3 guidance. Those aren't going to be material, but there will be something there. So you're still going to see leverage. And as you layer in this revenue and drop it to the 50%, you get a real good feel as to when that 30% target is doable. That is really, Ittai, the best way to do it. But that goal is clearly in front of us. We're going to continue to expand product margins, and there's a tremendous amount of leverage in the business. There is no doubt in the short term that the acquisitions have stalled that a little bit because as we -- we're synergizing them and incorporating them into the business, they've had a little bit of a diluting impact on the incremental returns. But we're going to go through that, and as the revenue ramps, you're going to see the leverage in the model. That's for you to do that, just to run those scenarios and you see it.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "A couple of questions, if I could. First off, on the high-efficiency PA, SkyHi, you're one of the very few people that -- companies that have this. Who else are you seeing when you compete for these sockets? Can you give me a rundown of maybe who else you think your competition is on that? And then, Don, the linear business seems to be doing particularly well. Any color on what your aspirations are for growth in the next quarter, and maybe for the full year? But you've added a couple of new companies. That's giving you a lot more traction. I know part of the rationale for that was to port their products into your much larger client base. How is that going, and what can we expect for growth on it? And then I have a couple of questions on pricing.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Ed, the SkyHi PA, as you said, that's a product line that's really tailored to our ultrahigh-efficiency amplifiers, LTE bands and the like, and the difference in our model over the last couple of years is we see different competitors when we sell PADs, when we sell discretes, multi-mode devices, ASMs, we tend to see a different customer set. To answer your direct question about SkyHi, we'd probably RFMD more than anybody else today.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. And Ed, with respect to high-performance analog, we certainly expect to be at least growing as fast as our mobile business. But by benefit of some of the new product categories we have and design win traction that we're pursuing right now, we hope to do even better than that getting into 2013.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Cody Acree with Williams Financial.", "Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Maybe you can go back to the dollar content question, I think, was asked earlier, and look at it on an incremental PAs as we kind of grow band into 3G and 4G, and then also as you're layering in things like the antenna switch modules and the power management, can you talk about maybe the percentage growth that you expect over the years or just dollar content growth as you get into these new markets that -- and how those might offset just typical ASP decline?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I think that's -- Cody, maybe I misunderstand the question. I think that's the 15% answer. What we -- the way we get to 15% is we increase the number of bands the way we think the market will morph over years. We've -- typically, we take the 2G market, which, of course, has the lowest ASP, and that is now in decline, a fairly rapid decline as a matter of fact. It's not going to go away, but it's in decline. And then we look at the mix of high-end, mid-tier and low-end smartphones, those that may be addressing local or regional content, and therefore, have fewer bands. And when we do that, and then factor in ASP on a phone-to-phone basis over time, we think that 15% for the next few years is a good number. In fact, we've come at that in many ways, we'd seem to come to that -- close to that answer, cut lots of different ways. And then of course, the other products we're talking about that we didn't previously address, that expands beyond that. So -- and you're going to begin to see in 2012, as you look at teardown reports and so on, you're going to start to see it -- lots of examples of Skyworks having a front-end, having a PAD, having filter and PA technology, ASMs, GPS products, multiple modes of WiFi, and you're going to see that being not an atypical lineup for Skyworks in teardown reports.", "Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "But some of these markets are relatively new for you, so would you expect that wowed [ph] maybe 15% CAGR over a longer term that you actually have an acceleration of that growth in the shorter term as you start to get into some of these new markets?", "David J. Aldrich", "That's absolutely the intent.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Matt Thornton with Avian Securities.", "Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you guys break out, I guess, in the March quarter, 2G versus 3G? And then as we look out too to the June quarter and beyond, if I kind of understood you correctly on some prior comments, should we continue to think about 2G as in continuous decline here, and then the HPA piece, then the 3G, 4G piece kind of growing in step with one another over time here? Is that a fair way to look at that?", "Donald W. Palette", "Matt, I'll just give you the statistics real quick. The 2G was roughly 25%, and EDGE, WEDGE, with WCDMA was roughly 75% for the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think the answer to the second part of the question is yes. You should see 3G and 4G continuing to displace and become a bigger percentage of our business, as it will become a bigger percentage of the market as well.", "Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got you. And then one follow-on, if I could, on the next-gen Samsung Galaxy products, it sounds like -- I think I probably lost count, but there's at least 5 sockets that you rattled off there. Do you care to throw a content -- a dollar number around that? And would that be the global variant? Or is that a CDMA-only variant or any color you have there?", "David J. Aldrich", "It would be the global variant. And I really rather not get into the specific dollar content. That's a little proprietary. And our customer probably wouldn't appreciate that. But it is high, and I think you're doing the part count right.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, I mean, it's one that's -- one real good case study of about seeing that diversification. You see our product in their traditional product. You see switch product, wireless LAN, GPS, and even some other technologies, so I think it's a great example of what we're capable of doing now at this full suite in technology.", "David J. Aldrich", "It's also -- I'll add on to what Liam said. It is also a case, if you look at a lot of products, we've talked over time about their being discrete, high-dollar content, high-performance and then much more highly integrated, and even those sockets where the amplifiers themselves are highly integrated, there's a lot of opportunities. So I think it kind of -- it reverses this notion that when you put lots of bands in a multi-mode device, all of a sudden you TAM-drops it. That's really not the case. We're not seeing that.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Dale Pfau with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Let's talk about your antenna switch modules. As I look at the competitive landscape out there, that seems to be one of the areas where you're really beginning to differentiate yourself from -- there's always been only a handful of guys really good in switches. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there in the competitive landscape? How many people there that might really be able to address some of these multi-throw switches and even the multi-throw that we're going to see in wireless LAN? And then how fast do you think that TAM could actually grow? I think that could grow much faster than your 15% CAGR?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Dale. Yes, I mean, so a couple of things. As you know, Skyworks has been a major, major supplier of switch for many years. I mean, we ship over 0.5 billion devices here, primarily out of Woburn. So we understand that business, but what's been great is, as you move into these multiband phones, you always need to be switching among bands, right? So you need to basically be communicating across bands, you need isolation, you need low insertion loss, and we've been masters of that for quite a while. The beauty now is that the throws are going up. The number of bands that we need to interact with are going up substantially. And our technology and our IP and our R&D team here is well-equipped to do that. We also have the unique advantage of working very closely with the RF amplifier team at Skyworks, so we can build solutions that work in concert. So with having said all that, we're seeing an opportunity now in some of these handsets where the ASM value could be over $1, in some cases $2 dollars, and we're starting to enjoy our first taste of those design wins in the second half of this year.", "David J. Aldrich", "And, Dale, one of the reasons why we steered away from that market in the past is why we did a lot of switches, mode switches, TR switches and the like. And as the antenna switch module in a simple dual-band phone, for example, it's more about the filter device, and the switching was done in pin diodes, and it really wasn't that complex. The ASPs were low. What's happening with the complexity is it can no longer be done with a pin diode matrix on a hunk of LTCC and some ceramic. It is really now requiring some pretty sophisticated signal processing and multi-throw switches. We do a lot of that SOI, for example. We don't need to do that in gallium arsenide, where we can integrate some logic and functionality. And so it's now become semiconductor-heavy, so it plays into Skyworks' strength.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And to my question there, is the TAM on that growing at faster than a 15% CAGR?", "David J. Aldrich", "For us, yes. And I think for the market as well because of the complexity.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So I wanted to just dig a little bit more in something you said in your opening remarks about your platform wins, the Huawei and the Samsung Galaxy 3 and the HTC 1. Could you just talk a little bit more about which products you're selling into those? Because those are 3 sort of -- aside from Apple, those are probably the 3 leading smartphone platforms out there. I want to get a better sense of what your content there is -- sort of looks like?", "David J. Aldrich", "It's a little different curve, but it is -- in all cases, it's fairly broad. It has amplifications, so transmit amplification. And in some cases, it's more functionality, where we're sweeping in things like ASMs. So amplifiers in all cases, but ASMs, GPS LNAs, WiFi devices, and I think maybe WiFI [indiscernible].", "Liam K. Griffin", "And some power management. And I think in some cases, Jay, we have some really customized multi-mode, multi-band engines in our apps, so we noted those as kind of marquee wins that reflected the customer but also some of the newer technology that we're releasing.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Those are substantive, meaningful dollar contents in each -- in all of those?", "David J. Aldrich", "In each case, yes.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, each case.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jaeson Schmidt with Craig-Hallum.", "Jaeson Schmidt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Just 2 quick questions for me. Don, what's your backlog coverage to your guide? And then just wanted to get your thoughts on channel inventory.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, our backlog coverage, as we do typically when we provide an outlook, is we're pretty much 100% booked at this point in time, and that's a combination of hard purchase orders and also the humbles [ph]. It's a combination of both forecasts that get us to that level.", "Jaeson Schmidt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "And then just kind of your thoughts on current channel inventory?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think current channel inventory is normal. I don't see any areas where there is excess inventory. So I think it's pretty normal for this time in year.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sujee De Silva with ThinkEquity.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "In terms of -- just under a year ago, you guys pulled up 2 big acquisitions. I want to understand today, sitting here, maybe the conditions that are different in terms of thinking about more acquisitions, or whether there are any holes you still need to plug to do more acquisitions?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, our strategy has been pretty clear. We look for acquisitions that are very quickly or immediately accretive, and that have an opportunity for us to add a platform that we can grow from. So this on bolt-on, wedge fillers, we're really looking for growth engines and -- so we don't see any technological -- technology gaps per se today, at least not major ones. So you have -- but you have to think of us looking at it that way. We opportunistically look for a cultural fit, something that we could integrate very quickly, and something that would be immediately accretive.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then a follow-up to the Samsung Galaxy 3 questions. Across the variant around world, are you sole source to -- on the PAs for those, or is that shared through the variance?", "David J. Aldrich", "It's not typically -- we're not sole source on the platform, although on the models, it would be sole source, so the custom per model, but not on the platform. We have company on the platform.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to catch up on the mix in the 3G, what was it? And how did it grow Q-on-Q?", "Donald W. Palette", "The 3G mix -- well, 2G was 25%. And as I said, our EDGE, WCDMA mix was 75%.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And then what was the -- when you look at this switch side -- switch -- antenna switch module, what was the revenues in the March quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "What sort of revenue was this ASM?", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "David J. Aldrich", "It was a few million dollars, below $10 million. It's really just beginning. But it ramps pretty -- it ramps solidly in the second half.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Don, just a quick question. You talked about acceleration in revenue growth based on the new platform ramps. Just wondering if that is a comment you're talking about in calendar year or fiscal year? And then was just wondering, Don, you talked about the -- I'm sorry, Dave, you talked about the customer diversification at prepared comments. Is there a way you can quantify that maybe, say, looking outside of your top customer, what the next, say, numbers 2 to 5, I mean is there some metric you can give us about how you're spreading it out over the customer base?", "Donald W. Palette", "As far as the growth opportunity, I really -- refers to the fiscal quarters for us through the calendar year as well. We just see what's the design pipeline and the wins that we've had in place earlier in the year. We just see some really nice growth opportunities. For the balance of our fiscal and the calendar year as well.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think it's quite -- it's a little tough to answer that question because it really depends upon how the market evolves. In the case of we're about 65% in the mobile space, 35% in our diversified HPA business, and within the high-performance analog. And within that 65%, our goal would to be as diversified as we possibly can be with the products that we address. In which case, a really good strategy would be implemented such that we mirror the customer concentration of the market. And that's as good as we can do it. And we're not exactly there today, but we're pretty close. So when you look at who's beyond the top 2 or 3, it really is a who's who among OEMs. So you'd look at LG, you'd look at ZTE, you'd look at Huawei, Motorola and others, almost stacked as if you would see them in the market.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Right. And within HPA, you can expand that suite beyond mobile, so you can start looking at gaming opportunities. You can look at the wireless infrastructure space. And there's a lot of things now with our power management suite that we can expand. So you've got customer diversification across the major Tier 1, but there's also a whole another's opportunity base now with newer products coming in through acquisition and organic growth, and also newer verticals that we're penetrating.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to you, Mr. Aldrich, for any additional or closing remarks.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, thank you for participating on today's call, and we look forward to seeing all of you in upcoming conferences.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference.

At this time I would turn you over to Tom Schiller - Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Schiller, please go ahead.", "Tom Schiller", "Good afternoon everyone and welcome to the Skyworks Solutions\u2019 Fiscal Fourth Quarter  and Year-End earnings conference  call. With me today are Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief  Executive. Officer, Don Palette, our Chief Financial  Officer, and Liam Griffin, our Senior  Vice President of Sales and Marketing.", "Dave will begin today\u2019s call with a business  overview followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook. We will then open the  lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include  statements related to our future results.  They are forward-looking statements as defined in  the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and  adversely from those projected, as a result of certain risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those  detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to  remind everyone that results and guidance we will discuss today are from  non-GAAP income statements consistent with the format we have used in the  past. Please refer to our press release  within the Investor Relations section of our company\u2019s website for a complete  reconciliation to GAAP.", "I will now turn over  the call over to Dave for his comments for the fourth quarter in fiscal year  2007.", "Dave Aldrich ", "Thanks Tom and welcome everyone. Today we announce our fourth fiscal quarter  and 2007 year-end results, and I am very pleased to report that Skyworks team  delivered strong year-over-year and strong sequential profit improvements. Our performance this quarter and throughout the  year helps to demonstrate our progress since exiting the baseband business a  year ago. At that time, you may recall,  we outlined a four-prong strategy.  First, to intensify our focus on areas of competitive strength and  differentiation, and this is squarely in the analog and in the RF domain. Second, to diversify our business into  non-handset linear applications that have high gross margins and have  annuity-like revenue streams. Third, capitalize  on content growth in 3G multimode applications, supporting all key OEMs. Fourth, to generate sustained higher financial  returns.", "Our results reflect  progress along each of these fronts. Skyworks  today is a stronger, a more competitive and profitable company. We have increased research and development investment  in highly-focused areas, while simultaneously partnering with the leading  chipset providers. Now this is something  we were frankly unable to accomplish when we were competing with the very same  companies in the baseband arena just one year ago. And by increasing our internal manufacturing  capacity, in addition to developing external second sources for foundry and for  assembly services, we are well positioned today to economically capture the increased  demand for our linear products and our front-end solutions. In short, the Skyworks team remains committed  to delivering profitable growth.", "Okay, now let me take  you a moment to specifically address some fourth fiscal quarter and year-end highlights. First for the quarter, we increased our  revenue by 9% sequentially, we have expanded our gross margin into the mid-39%  range with diluted record EPS at $0.14, and this is $0.01 ahead of consensus,  and we generated a record $30 million from cash flow operations.", "Now at a higher level  during the quarter, we continue to gain momentum with our linear products  business by, during the year, introducing over 100 new analog products, as we  continue to round up our catalog. We  strengthened our position with existing handset customers as well as securing  important new ones. With our latest high,  average selling prices are high, ASP multimode front-end modules and radio solutions.  We captured several reference designs with the industry\u2019s top baseband  providers, which will translate into meaning revenue for fiscal year 2008.", "Most recently in the intellectual property front, we have acquired Freescale Semiconductors\u2019 proprietary GaAs power amplifier and front-end module design and related intellectual property. We have purchased 16 fundamental HBT and RF MEMs patents developed by Rockwell Science  Center. At the same time, we divested some non-strategic bulk order pads. In the case of Freescale, I would also like to add that we can now count them among our growing list of reference design partners, a core part of our strategy.", "Finally, during the year, we have also expanded our capacity in both our domestic gallium arsenide fabs, both of them PF HBT, and implemented a hybrid manufacturing model with multiple external foundries, with the goal of capturing additional share.", "Now at Skyworks, we have developed an operating model which allows us to maintain high internal capacity utilization, by creating second sources for high fixed cost services. Services like foundry and assembly. Successful implementation of this approach provides us with a great deal of supply chain flexibility. It lowers our capital investment and it provides us with the ability to meet outside demand. We\u2019re convinced that this approach will improve our gross margin and help us lower our capital spendings.", "Okay, now I would like to further elaborate a bit on a few specific accomplishments during the quarter and our two product areas. First, linear products. We have ramped up the volume production through remote meter reading solutions for utility and industrial applications. When you consider that there are an estimated two and a half billion households and businesses worldwide that still require manual gas, water, power meter readings, there is clear demand for an economic RF solution that could provide these real-time logistics. We\u2019re ramping some of those into production now.", "We have now reached the high volume production levels with multiple, high performance receivers in support of several top-tier base station LEFs. These receivers are providing more RF content, more dollars to Skyworks, and at the same time they are lowering our customers\u2019 building material costs, and by reducing the size of the overall base station. A win-win. We have sampled our first both filter plus power amplifier module in a wireless LAN access point manufacturer. This is now augmenting our existing volume b/g and n wireless front-end module business. We continue to be very encouraged by the growth prospects of this business, our linear products business, which now represents nearly one fourth of our revenues. In our participation in an addressable market that is nearly four times, four times the size of the wireless cellular handset industry.", "Okay now turning to our handset business. The transformation from voice-centric phone to 2G phone, voice-only, to multimedia EDGE, WEDGE, Wide LAN and CDMA platforms continues to accelerate and it continues to gain momentum. With this trend, the complexity in the front-end module increases as each new operating frequency band requires additional amplifiers; additional filtering and switching and control. This is now expanding our ASPs by as much as threefold from the 2G design. At the same time, there is a narrowing of the competitive landscape, given the requisite degree of technical and manufacturing breadth, particularly when compared to the less challenging 2G power amplifier market.", "A special note during the quarter: we began multimode front-end modules shipments to get another Tier 1 listed OEM, and we are absolutely delighted to be entrusted with business spanning all of the industry-leading manufacturers today. At the same time and not to be underestimated, Research In Motion (RIM) and MediaTek in China are quickly becoming two of our fastest growing customers, given RIM\u2019s strong growth among enterprise users, and MediaTek\u2019s success in delivering low-cost platforms for emerging markets. Given that the number of suppliers today who possess the breadth and technology and the available capacity to address these needs is decreasing, we believe Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capture share for front-end content that will grow from roughly $1 to $2 in 2G and CDMA and GSM cellphones to nearly $6 in 3X and multimode handsets. This is an incremental opportunity that our company measures in the billions of dollars over time.", "Okay so in summary, the Skyworks team continues to focus on building an increasingly diversified business, with stable earnings growth driven by defensible competitive advantages in linear products and in handset RF end markets. With our strong market position and our dedication to operational fundamentals, we believe we can outgrow our addressable markets. We believe we will further expand our gross margins and operating margins.", "Okay now, I would like to turn this over to Don for his review.", "Don Palette", "Thank you, Dave. Before I provide my overview of our results,  I would like to say that as Skyworks\u2019 new Chief Financial Officer, I am excited  about the company\u2019s financial outlook. Skyworks  is very well positioned, as Dave has  underscored. One of my areas of focus  would be to ensure there are growth opportunities to deliver earnings leverage  and maximize our return on investment. Based  on our product pipeline, I believe we have a business model capable of  delivering higher returns. Specifically,  at a $250 million quarterly run rate, I see the path to generating operating  margins approaching 20%. At the same  time, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet.", "Now for  my comments for the quarter just completed.  Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter was at $190.5 million, up 9%  sequentially and at the higher end of our guidance range. Gross profit for the quarter was $75.1 million  or 39.4% of revenue, a 65 basis points sequential expansion.", "Our  continuous improvement in gross margin reflects the following: delivering on yield improvement initiatives,  higher equipment efficiency and factory utilization, and enhanced product mix,  as multimode FEMs and linear products become an increasing part of our  business.", "Operating  expenses were $52.4 million, of which R&D expenses total $31.8 million and SG&A  costs were $20.6 million.", "Our  operating income for the quarter was $22.7 million, generating a return of  12%. Net other income for the quarter  was $388,000 while taxes were at $128,000, which did exclude a non-cash tax  benefit of $3.5 million reported in our GAAP results.", "Net  income totalled $23 million, up 36% sequentially and 120% on a year-over-year  basis. Earnings per share was a record  $0.14, one penny ahead of consensus estimates, and reflecting a 2x improvement  over the $0.07 reported this time last year.", "Now  turning to the balance sheet. We exit  the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term investments,  of $254 million, which is up $90 million from the prior quarter. More specifically, we generated a record $30  million in cash flow from operations, recorded $10 million in depreciation, and  invested $12 million in capital expenditures primarily on fab and assembly and  test capacity.", "Now to our business outlook for the  first fiscal quarter. Given strong  order visibility and the ramp of our newest analog and front-end module  designs, we once again anticipate top line growth approaching 10 percent on a  sequential basis. Assuming revenue of  $207 million, we would suggest modeling a gross margin of between 39.5 and 40.0  percent, and operating expenses of $54 to $55 million, yielding a 13% operating  margin.", "For the line, we are forecasting interest expense of $200,000 and a cash tax  rate of 3% or $800,000 which translates into a $0.15 to $0.17 earnings per  share, based on a 162 shares outstanding.", "As a reminder, we currently have NOLs in tax credits on our balance sheet,  which will shield approximately $250 million in earnings and taxes. For  financial modeling purposes, you should assume a cash tax rate of 3% for your  2008 and 2009 model years as we continue to use our NOLs.", "That concludes our prepared comments, and Operator, please open the lines  for the question and answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Due to time constraints, we ask that you have one question and one  follow-up.", "We will go first to Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Cody Acree -  Stifel Nicolaus.", "Congratulations guys on a great quarter.  Don, welcome.", "Don Palette", "Thank you.", "Cody Acree -  Stifel Nicolaus.", "Don, just one brief clarity. Did you  give a share count guidance? I was  brushing through there?", "Don Palette", "Yes, 162 million.", "Cody Acree -  Stifel Nicolaus.", "162, okay great thanks. You mentioned  a ramp of leading Tier 1 OEMs this last quarter. Can you give any quantification of  contribution, material, non-material, meaningful expectations for Q4, and  expectations of maybe that OEM ramp through 2008?", "Liam Griffin", "Great question, we appreciate that. Now as you know, we have been diligently  working with each of the top five OEMs over the last year and even now and in  \u201908. We have made a tremendous progress  along the way, specifically, around WCDMA and EDGE, as we move into the multimode  arena. But there are some specific  accounts that we cannot get into the details on here, as you know. But again, we look forward to grow among the  top five. We are pleased that we have  been able to secure each one of these with a highly sophisticated multimode  design, and we expect a report on future gains as we move through the year.", "Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus", "Then lastly, if I may, could you go through  just a view of inventory health. OEM  versus what is happening in the distribution channel?", "Dave  Aldrich", "Cody, I do not see any significant  inventory overhang issues. It you mean  of the end products or the components that we make, it seems to be quite  stable. From my perspective, there is  some tightening of supply of some components out there that we have been able  to secure multiple sources. It is not  going to be an issue for us, but there is some tightening of the supply chain  but we do not see an inventory overhang impacting the business.", "Operator", "We go next to Amit  Kapur with Piper Jaffray.", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "Given your recent announcement of the conversion  from 4 inch to 6 inch, can you walk through some of the potential gross margin  impacts of that transition, and how are you working to maybe minimize some of  those impacts?", "Dave  Aldrich", "Sure Amit, I will take that one. If you look at our business model, when we  talked about it in the prepared comments, we have done a lot of work over the  last couple of years to provide copy examples for our critical processes, PHEMP  and HBT being two of them. So we now  have partners who are able to build, not only surge demand, but a significant  amount of our demand. We are doing that  in assembly and tests as well. As a  result, we do not have to do a bricks and mortar expansion. We have already acquired most of the  equipment over the years that are capable of doing 6 inch. We are in the process of cutting that  equipment over, qualifying new processes, and buying some new gear. But since this is not a bricks and mortar  play for us, it will fit pretty comfortably in the capital expenditure profile  we have had for the last several quarters.  So it is going to be a different model for us. We have already increased capacity. We are leveraging that now and beginning to  fill the capacity we have throughout 2007 in our boundaries. We are exercising and working closely with  those second tiers. It is different. You  should think of it as being a similar capex quarter over quarter number that  you have seen from us in the last few quarters.", "Amit Kapur - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great, that is helpful. Maybe as my follow-up, could you update us on  the transition that you are seeing from PA modules to front-end modules, and  give a sense on how you see the WCDMA front-end module end market trends in the  coming quarters?", "Liam  Griffin", "Yes, we are seeing a pretty aggressive  acceleration, specifically at the higher end, EDGE and WCDMA and so as  integrated FEMs, adding either a switch or a filter, in some cases, both. So we are seeing the adoption occurring quite  rapidly. We are also seeing the trend  toward multiple PAs in phones happening now.  We are seeing European phones with band 1 and band 8, and WCDMA made it  with an EDGE device that may have a nine 9 trough switch. We are seeing US phones with a band 2, bands  5 and an EDGE device. So all of that is  materializing and we feel pretty good about it.  As you know, Skyworks is uniquely positioned to have normally the  GaAs/HBT technology for our PAs, but also have strength in TM switching and  assembly testing. So we are bringing  that all together and it is definitely a trend that is going to play well for  us.", "Operator", "We go next to Mike  Burton with ThinkEquity Partners.", "Mike Burton - ThinkEquity Partners", "Hey, thanks guys, great quarter. How many 10% customers did you have in the  quarter and for the year?", "Don  Palette", "As for the quarter, we have three, Sony  Ericsson, Samsung, and Motorola.", "Mike Burton - ThinkEquity Partners", "And then also for the year as well?", "Don  Palette", "Yes.", "Mike Burton - ThinkEquity Partners", "Okay, thanks. Can you break down the percentage of sales  that you are currently selling to radios, perhaps as a bundle with the PA, and  then maybe just the radio portion of those revenues?", "Don  Palette", "Our revenue for standalone transceivers and  handsets is in the mid single digits. Right,  none of those are sold at standard standalone price, so they are all bundled.", "Operator", "We go next to  Jeroen Bos with UBS Equity Research.", "Jeroen Bos - UBS Equity Research", "Yes, thank  you. A quick question, one of your  customers at MediaTek this morning made some comments about shortages in the  power amplifier side. Maybe you can  comment what you are seeing there, and if this is related to, maybe, better  than expected ramp with your new large OEM?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, great  question. As we noted in the prepared comments, MediaTek is a very important customer for  Skyworks. If you are following that  company, tremendous year over year gain, and their businesses is largely driven  by gains in emerging markets with SoC Solutions and GPRS. We are alongside MediaTek in a significant  number of the platforms here. We gained  market share. Quite frankly, the  shortages that you are speaking about right are creating opportunities for Skyworks. Our supply chain has done quite well on  delivering these products. We have been  a welcomed partner with MediaTek and we do not see any problem in our food  chain at all in supporting them.", "Dave Aldrich ", "Let me be more specific. The shortages that they referred to are not  to Skyworks. It is creating an  opportunity. We are picking up shares as  result of those shortages.", "Jeroen Bos - UBS Equity Research", "Okay, great, and maybe you will follow up,  maybe I missed that. Can you comment on  what the linear growth revenue was sequentially? And if you see any negative impact on  slowdown with the infrastructure side of the revenue?", "Dave Aldrich ", "The linear products have been hanging in  there at about a fourth of our revenue.  So, that did not prove material at all in this quarter. We did see some softening of the  infrastructure business as an account.  However, we were offsetting that with some strength in some of our more  diversified catalogue business, some wireless end products, and some of the broad-based  standard products mix that we talked about.  Yes, we did see some softness, we offset it, and it remained roughly one  fourth of our revenue.", "Operator", "We will go next to Ed Snyder with Charter  Equity Research.", "Ed Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Thank you very much and good quarter,  guys. Regarding Freescale. So you are picking up Freescale\u2019s  business. What exactly are you getting  for them? Will the acquisition be  diluted or accreted near-term or long-term?  What does this do to your share at Motorola or any other vendors? I know they sold to RIM and Sagem also. So  does the share play and expect maybe a little better pricing because of it?", "Dave Aldrich ", "Sure, thanks Ed. As you are probably are aware, Freescale has  elected to get out of the power amplifier business and to focus on their core  strength. So, as a result, we have  acquired their intellectual property. We  have acquired their patents. We have  acquired the rights of their designs and reference design. Frankly, we are really quite pleased to be  able to add Freescale to our list of baseband partners going forward, something  that we are very interested to continue to expand and something that we really  could not do when they competed with us in the power amplifier and front-end.", "By the way, Ed, I do not know if you caught  the fact that we also acquired about 16 pretty fundamental RF LANs and HBT  patents from Rockwell while at the same time divesting a few of the bulk order  pads. We did not acquire any  assets. We did not acquire people. To answer the question \u201cWill it be  accreted?\u201d In the very short term in the  next couple of quarters, it is an insignificant amount of revenue. However, as we move beyond the next couple of  quarters as these new reference designs go into production, and as we begin to  frankly take some of that terrific IP and apply it to our base business, we  think this will be quite accretive. The  next couple of quarters are insignificant, but quite accretive to revenue and  profit as we move over out in time.", "Ed Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "How does it work in Motorola now? I know Freescale is applying some of the FEMs  and PAs to Motorola\u2019s phones. Would they  continue to build the legacy products and you will just take over all the new  stuff, or how does it work?", "Dave Aldrich", "At Motorola, I  cannot divulge too much of the specifics. But suffice to say that for the next  couple of quarters, it will not be a significant driver of any revenue at  Skyworks. It would be a diluted driver.  But now at Motorola, wherein the CDMA RAZR series where in the EDGE, EDGE RAZR  2, where smothered now across all of the wide-band CDMA platforms were across,  virtually all of their low-end W series, the ODM channel. So right now, we are in their top, their mid,  their low end, and as we move throughout our way, we will have the vast  majority of Motorola share.", "Operator", "We will go next to  Jeff Kvaal of Lehman Brothers.", "Jeff Kvaal - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, thanks very much. Obviously, this is returning to the theme of  component tightness in the industry for a minute. Do you feel like the overall component  tightness is not necessarily yours, or someone else is contributing to  restraining unit volumes for you in the fourth quarter?", "Dave Aldrich", "I do not think so. If we look at our  visibility, we see that the visibility is quite strong right now. The market looks very strong from where we  sit, from an overall unit volume in our share as our prepared comments had  described. So I would say that while  there are component shortages, I have not seen direct evidence that any of  customers can not build phones because they cannot somehow acquire those  components. Liam, want to add to that?", "Liam Griffin", "Oh, I agree, I agree with that and I think our supply changes well. It is pretty sophisticated in managing the  sourcing side of the equation and they are working to insure that the demand  can be realized.", "Jeff Kvaal - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. In general, I think of the  seasonality in the fourth quarter. It  has been up up approximately 10% in an environment where the market is healthy  and you guys clearly are gaining some market share. One might think that there will an  opportunity for you folks to outperform, maybe not in the December quarter but  perhaps seasonally would be even less down in March as well. Does that piece make sense?", "Dave Aldrich", "We have, as when I made a comment that we have a  strong visibility, that means we are largely hooked to this guidance, and we  are very comfortable with the guidance and I agree with assessment that the  December should be a seasonal high quarter.", "Operator", "We are going next to George Tai-Won of CIBC World Markets", "George  Tai-Won - CIBC World Markets", "Thanks for taking my questions. Don, could  you follow-up on your comment about reaching 20% operating margin at the $250  million run rate level? How do you get  there? What type of gross margin and  opex are you expecting?", "Don Palette", "I sure will. We are very much focused, as I said in our  comments. We see a path from our new  business models standpoint at $250 million to generate operating margins close  to 20%. It is really focused on in two  areas, and that is in gross margin and the leveraging of our operating expenses  from a gross margin standpoint. Given  our diversified product mix and are demonstrated operational focus. And I really think you can see that if you  look at the margin improvement that we have pegged into this model over the  last several quarters. It is really a  result of driving product yields, equipment efficiencies and we really focused  on material costs. We have done an  excellent job of being focused and executing in that area. We believe we can generate margins at the  revenue level in the low 40s. Then when  you look at our operating expense base, there is not a lot of incremental cost  that we have to add to generate that revenue.  So we expect some leverage and we would expect that number to be  something below 25%. So you can do the  math and you could see that we would start approaching that 20% return.", "George  Tai-Won - CIBC World Markets", "Can you give us an idea of the timing you  are looking out over this to reach this type of numbers?", "Dave  Aldrich", "We do not provide guidance outlook for any  more than a quarter. However, I must say  that again we believe that the unifying growth of the overall industry is going  to be strong. We believe that multimode,  where we are quite well positioned even relative to 2G. But higher dollar content is going to become  a disproportionate percentage of the market, and linear products is  growing. So, we do not provide guidance  for more than a quarter, but this is not a number we just pulled out of the air  either.", "Operator", "We will go next to Aaron  Husock with Morgan Stanley.", "Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I am just following up on the opex  side. R&D was a little bit higher  than what I was expecting in the September quarter. Can you confirm what drove  that sequential increase, and whether the same factors would drive it up again  and/or down in December?", "Don  Palette", "In our fourth physical quarter, it really  was just the timing of some of the investments we are making on projects. We had some higher material costs associated  with specific projects and just some timing associated with mass and some other  variable expenses in R&D. We have  been making some capital investments, they are really focused on improving our  order development cycle and some of that depreciation started to hit in the  fourth quarter. So that is really what  was driving the increases.", "Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, the R&D dollars, did they go up  again in December? Or do you see a  little bit of a decline? Will some of  those mass costs fall off maybe?", "Don  Palette", "I think it is going to be relatively flat  based on the program profile that we are seeing right now.", "Operator", "We are going next to Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.", "Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank ", "Hi, guys, a couple of questions. First, you had other income of $3 million  that contributed $0.02 to your bottom line.  What was that and is that part of your guidance for the following  quarter?", "Don  Palette", "Well as I talked about, we talked a little  bit about the approach to take for our tax rate on a go forward basis. And as I mentioned we have NOLs and tax  credits on the balance sheet that are adjusted by a valuation allowance,  okay. And the accounting rules require  that we look at that quarterly; and when you get to a certain level of  assurance of profitability, you have to adjust the valuation allowance. We actually did that in the fourth  quarter. So some of that was a balance  sheet entry; a portion of that actually benefited the tax expense which was  about $3.5 million in the fourth quarter.  That is on a GAAP basis. Now, we  adjusted that on the non-GAAP basis back to our cash tax rate which is 3% so  that is what you saw on the fourth quarter.", "Dave Aldrich ", "So Brian, when we provided our guidance and  then we delivered the earnings per share this quarter, it was, as I have said,  above guidance. We did not take  benefit. We backed out that credit. So it is not correct that benefited our pro  forma results.", "Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank", "So you are saying the other income was in  tax adjustment.", "Dave Aldrich ", "Yes, that we backed out for pro forma  purposes. And so consistent with our  guidance, we backed that out.", "Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank", "And then RIM is  going to be launching some white band front-end modules that Nokia and the Bose  will have next year. That will collapse  the number of PAs used in the device from five down to two. Are you prepared with technology that can  compete with that one day when they come out with that product?", "Dave Aldrich ", "Yes.", "Operator", "We will go next to James  Faucette with Pacific Crest.", "James Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities", "Thank you very  much. Most of my questions have been  answered. Although I am wondering if you  could comment a little bit about what level of engagement you have been able to  achieve thus far with some of the up and coming baseband providers specifically  ST and Infineon and Broadcom?", "Liam Griffin ", "Yes James. We thought we have actually been doing quite  well along the baseband front here. Some  of the names you mentioned and some others like TI. We are right now working with just about  everyone, I would say the top five or six market share players in baseband.", "ST was some of the  changes that we are seeing in some of our major Tier 1 accounts. It is now becoming a new and emerging focus  for us right now.", "Infineon, we have  been working with for quite some time and have some engagements with them in Korea.", "Broadcom, lot of  things happening there, and our power amplifier technology gets very well  across the whole suite of suppliers that you mentioned.", "Another one here  that I definitely see as a being a big part of our story 2008 is Texas  Instruments. We have been a strong  partner with them on a low cost of platforms and a low cost GPRS world. We have several engagements with them in  EDGE. Not only power amplifiers but also  with our Helios FEM radio solutions and I think you are going to hear more  positive comments about TI and the other names that you mentioned as we move  through the year.", "James Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities", "So on a relative  basis, would you expect, as those people particularly the STs, Infineons and  Broadcoms as they generally take market share over the next few years? At least  that is expected. Would you expect your  positioning within them to allow you to also take share? Or is it more of a trade-off where your  positioning within those suppliers is likely to be not in line with your  overall market positioning?", "Liam Griffin ", "Actually, I think  these changes that we are alluding to here are very positive thrusts in terms  of gaining share. Those names that you  mentioned are going to gain share, and I count that right now, we have plenty  of head room there. We think they are  going to facilitate our ability to really take it to the next level with  certain key customers so we are very excited about it. We are engaged with everyone that you mentioned  and we think that it is not a trade-off for us.  It is an upside.", "Operator", "We have one follow  up question from Ed Snyder with the Charter Equity Research.", "Ed Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "In terms of your  business with the largest OEMs, we can kind of touch them a little there. Are you seeing upside demand from the top  tier OEMs? I know you are in the 3G  business, that is kind of a recent addition. But has it expanded beyond that  until, like, EDGE or 2G business also?  Because we are hearing about material weakness won the competitors there  and it seems like a number of your competitors are picking up shares there and  it also seen in your business.", "Dave Aldrich ", "Yes. And thanks Ed.  As you appreciated it, I cannot be terribly specific here so I am going  to broaden the question a little bit. We  do see increase in demand, believe it or not, even though it consolidated a  great deal of share among the top several OEMs and so we absolutely see that. We see it continuing the trend of consolidation  of share on the back of the brand strength scale and so on. So as we see our demand profile moving  throughout not only this quarter, but throughout 2008. We think that demand will remain healthy and  there is a little bit of an interesting spin on that. We talked about MediaTek. We also think that those indigenous and many  of the emerging markets are now being serviced by sort of a reference design  approach that lowers their overall building materials and time to market. And so we were able to address a large swath  of the market by addressing a couple of baseband partnerships.", "With respect to  second half of the question, Ed, it is typical for us to bundle a solution on  the front end domain that includes the multiple bands of wide band CDMA frequency. I think it was an earlier question that was I  was maybe trying to get at that", "along with EDGE. Because if you look at, let us say a design  that may have quad band EDGE with band WAN for year for wide band CDMA, there  is a pretty complicated filter bag, a multi-trough switch with maybe a six or  nine trough switch. There is a lot of  control and logic that goes into that and increasingly what we see is a system  that goes from the transceiver drives most of the control logic and the  filtering and switching from a front-end module that encompasses quad band  EDGE. It would then output to multiple  bands or wide band CDMA. So it is more  typical than not that with our customers, we sell both the wide band CDMA and  EDGE at the same time.", "And incidentally, we are selling wide band  CDMA and EDGE to all the top OEMs.  Though even though it is not always the case that they are bundled, it  usually is and we sell both to across the border.", "Operator", "And we will take a follow up with Aaron Husock with Morgan Stanley.", "Aaron  Husock \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "As you think about the December quarter,  should we expect that your RF sales and your linear sales to grow at roughly  the same rate? Or should there be a  disparity, which group would grow faster?  And then also on the linear side, I think that you are getting some more  Wireless LAN traction alongside Broadcom.  When then should we expect a material ramp up in there?", "Dave  Aldrich", "I think with respect to the mix, I think it  will be similar in December. You are  right, we alluded to a little bit of a mix shift away from, at least for the  short term, a little bit of the infrastructure business. Although we got some new products ramping  there as well. We talked about that in  our prepared comments. They are in the  press release. But we do see linear  products being up quarter over quarter with a little bit of a different mix. So  I do not think it is going to vary much from that three quarter, one quarter  frankly in the short term.", "Liam Griffin ", "Right.  And with respect to your question relative to Wireless LAN and Broadcom,  we are ramping those products right now.  We got more than eight different designs in production with Broadcom  that is band b/g platforms up to 11n.  There are several other wireless band OEMs and ODMs that we are working  with us as well.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions  at this time. Mr. Aldrich, I would like  to turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.", "Dave  Aldrich", "Thank you very much. This concludes our call today. On behalf of the entire Skyworks team, thank  you for participating. We look forward  to updating you on our performance next quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tom Schiller, Investor Relations for Skyworks.  Mr. Schiller, please go ahead.", "Tom Schiller", "Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks Fiscal First Quarter of 2008 Conference Call.  With me today are Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Palette, our Chief Financial Officer and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing.  Dave will begin today\u2019s call with the business overview followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook.  We will then open the lines for your question.", "Please note that our comments today are statements relating to future results that are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to those noted in our earning\u2019s release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.  I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our pro forma income statement consistent with the format we have used in the past.  Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.  I will now turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "Dave Aldrich", "Welcome everyone.  Today, we announced our first fiscal quarter 2008 and I am pleased to report that we delivered solid performance in the December quarter with our team\u2019s focus on operational execution translating into improvements in profitability.  Our increasing diversification in the new markets, coupled with content gains in the handset front-end modules fueled double digit top line growth and expanding margins as well as both record earnings per share in cash flow generation.", "Specifically during the quarter, we grew our top line 11% sequentially to over $210 million.  We expanded our gross margins to nearly 40%.  We have posted $29 million of operating income, this is up 26% sequentially.  It represents nearly a 14% operating margin.  We delivered EPS of $0.17 and we have generated $55 million of cash flow from operations.", "At the highest level, our performance continues to reflect the fundamental shift taking place in our business.  Frankly and based on many of your recent many investor comments, I do not believe we have adequately communicated to investors just how significantly Skyworks has evolved over the past couple of years, so as a result, I would like to spend just a few minutes today outlining the transformation that is occurring within our company.", "Now, for many of you, if you have followed us at the time of the launch of Skyworks or at the time of the merger in 2002, Skyworks was at that time a digital-base pan and primarily a 2G CDMA and GSM power amplifier company.  Since that time, we have aggressively focused on four initiatives.", "First, we are continuing to diversify Skyworks.  We are leveraging our catalog business, our world-wide distribution network and we are expanding into a broader set of end-market including broadband, industrial, medical, computing, wireless networking, cellular infrastructure and to give you just a sense for the scale of our business, we are not supporting around 1000 customers.  And we have a little over 2500 skews.  And in fact, in 2007, we introduced well over 100 new analog solutions.", "At the same time, we are expanding our customer footprint in existing key accounts via forward analog integration.  In applications like satellite set-top boxes, notebook computers, cellular base stations, wireless routers, and this is just to name a few.", "And even within our handset business, we are also aggressively diversifying.  Now back in 2005, we were supporting three of the top five cellular OEMs with custom products.  Whereas today, we are shifting higher value EDGE, wEDGE FEMs to each and every one of the top five handset suppliers.  So in other words, we have been diversifying our business within both our linear products and handsets.", "The second initiative is that we have been delivering and developing higher margin products.  With the introduction of a host of new innovative solutions, we have created a portfolio that is not characterized by not only longer product life cycles and in some cases annuity like revenue streams, but also higher contribution margin.  This transition is occurring on multiple fronts, first, standard catalog products, high margin, and diverse-stand catalog products; second, custom analog and RF solutions in multiple markets and obviously multi mode front modules in handsets.", "Just as a marker in fact, our linear products application specific products typically carry contributions above 70%.", "Now across the board, both our handset and newer linear product customers place a high value on architectures that help them reduce size, that help them resolve noise problems in many applications, in many cases, they are looking to reduce the bill material complexity and otherwise, enable their competitive differentiation.  So just another way, we are delivering higher margins in both our linear products business and in our handset business.", "Now our third initiative, we have been capitalizing on the increase in handset front-end module content.  The migration to 3G multi-mode whether it is EDGE, wEDGE, wide band CDMA, wireless phones and platforms from voice centric phones just a couple of years ago is accelerating.  With this trend, the complexity in the front end significantly increased, and this expands our addressable content by as much as three times or threefold.  And the reason for this content growth in front-end modules, I think is relatively straightforward.  A couple of examples, multiple bands are typically required ot facilitate backward compatibility to multiple standards.", "Now, data services are simply not available in all areas, as an example, in London, if you drive just a few miles outside of the city, you will lose 3G signal.  These phones therefore handoff from an EDGE to a GSM signal, multiple bands.  The simultaneous transmission of voice and data may not sound like a big deal and it is a new requirement in more and more handsets, the issue is even while in data mode, the phone is required to negotiate with a base station on an ongoing basis for potential incoming calls.  The receiver is always on.  The receiver is always drawing current.  This is not the case in the 2G.", "These newer phones by their very nature require true broadband access for applications like music, data, and video.  Signal integrity therefore is essential and it is essential in all forms of data communications, signal integrity.  And this is no small feat in a mobile environment.", "So the integration of these various bands for reliable high-speed access requires very complex modules which must remain at the same time physically small, they must remain very power-efficient as more features are crammed into the same volume.  And they need to be obviously cost-effective that needs to be valued.  They need to deliver value to our customers.", "And this complexity is creating an incremental RF market opportunity measured in the billions of dollars.  And at the same time, because of the complexity, the competitive landscape is narrowing with fewer and fewer suppliers able to support both the technical requirements and the manufacturing scale required by the leading handset OEMs.  Now this dynamic is in stock contrast to 2G, as the very real side benefit of stabilizing the industry\u2019s pricing environment.", "Now, our fourth and final initiative is we are executing and we are extremely focused on operational fundamentals.  Our manufacturing team is intensely focused on continuous improvements in our product yields, the utilization of our equipment, our equipment efficiency at all times and in return on all invested capital.  Towards these end, our established hybrid manufacturing model and that is multiple external boundaries, allows us to maintain very high internal capacity utilization by creating second sources for high fixed cost services like boundary, like assembly.", "And this approach provides us supply chain flexibility, it provides us with lower overall capital investment and the ability to meet to our customer\u2019s outside demand.  I think most importantly, this model gives us a gross margin advantage and is enabling us further improvements in helping our financial returns.", "Okay, to recap, the four initiatives that are transforming our business is that we are driving to further diversify across both handsets and linear products.  We are delivering more and more high margin products.  We are capitalizing on the increasing content, and we are focusing on operational fundamentals to improve higher margins.", "And just to switch gears for a moment and looking a bit further into the future, you are going to begin to see Skyworks expand into additional new markets, adjacent markets, new opportunities, while leveraging the very same core technologies.", "As an example, we have intensified our focus on the emerging energy management space.  Considering that there are 2.5 billion households and business world-wide that employ manual gas, water, power and meter readings, there is pent up demand by many service providers for an economic RF solution that can provide real time usage reporting, and just recently, we have developed a product and we have been awarded a strategic win with a custom-solution with one of the largest energy service providers in the United States.", "Next is another example that we have now introduced 4G WiMAX in FEMTO.  FEMTO sells solutions with Samsung as our lead customer.  FEMTO cells are small cellular base stations designed for residential and small business.  Now these small base stations provide better coverage and solve very real time signal coverage and capacity issues.  Now this an interesting and I think an exciting opportunity for us given that there are some estimates that world-wide FEMTO cell subscriptions are expected to surpass a hundred million end-users over the next several years.  This represents a market opportunity for FEMTO cell devices in the measure of billions of dollars.", "Another example where we are especially excited by our growth aspects within the highly diverse automotive sector.  Here we are seeing a dramatic rise in addressable opportunities is cars increasingly come equipped with keyless entry systems, with global positioning, climate control, engine and tire sensors, Bluetooth, digital receivers as well as after market toll tags, and this content increases in hybrid vehicles.  Given our 6949 quality certification, we have began to capture several wins with customers and some of those customers today include DELFI, Siemens, Johnson Controls and garment.", "Now each of these three examples represent the intersection, and I think hopefully quite simple, the intersection of high growth, high margin market opportunities with what we do well in the analog and RF domain.", "So in summary, the Skyworks team is intensifying focus on our areas of strength, namely linear products and handset RF end-markets.  With our innovative product portfolio, with our strong customer engagements, and with our dedication to operational fundamentals, we believe we could continue to outgrow our addressable markets.  We believe, we will continue to further expand our gross in our operating modules.", "I would like to now turn this over to Don for his financial review.", "Don Palette", "Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $210.5 million dollars, up 11% sequentially and $3.5 million dollars better than our guidance.  Gross profit for the quarter was $83.8 million or 39.8% of revenue and 40 basis points sequential expansion and 130-basis point improvement year over year.  Our continuous improvement over the last four quarter reflects the following:  Enhanced product mix is multi mode, FEMs and linear products become an increasing part of business, higher equipment efficiency and in fact, utilization, progress on yield improvement initiatives and double digit year-over-year material cost reductions.  You may not realize this, but at Skyworks, each and every function, department and operating location has monthly, weekly and in some cases, daily improvement initiatives with very specific metrics that aggregate to our profit growth targets.", "We have structured these metrics to clearly tie to incentive plans and align with shareholder value creation.  We believe this attention to detail is helping to drive our margin improvements.", "Going back to the income statement, operating expenses were $55.2 million of which R &D expenses totaled $32.9 million and SG&A cost were $22.3 million.  As a result, our operating incomes for the quarter was $28.6 million, up 26 % sequentially and representing a 13.6% operating margin.  Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was $158,000.00 while taxes were $568,000.00 reflecting a 2% cash tax rate.  Net income was $27.9 million yielding a record $0.17 of earnings per share, one penny ahead of consensus estimates.", "Now, turning to the balance sheet.  We exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents as well as short term investments of $207 million.  During the quarter, we recorded $11 million of depreciation, generated a record $55 million in cash flow from operations, invested $19.1 million in demand driven capital expenditures primarily for fab and assembly and test capacity, acquired a free scales PAFEM portfolio, related IP and inventory as well as 16 fundamental HBT and RF amends patents developed by the Rockwell Science Center for roughly $30 million.  Retired $49 million of convertible debt and in the process reduced our share base.", "Now, to our business outlook for the second fiscal quarter.  As Dave outlined earlier, but executing on our diversification strategy, we expect to largely offset the seasonally low March quarter with growth from our linear product\u2019s portfolio and handset multi-mode content gains.  Assuming revenue of $200 million, we anticipate maintaining gross margins at 39.8% with operating expenses at Q1 levels, just above $55 million.", "Below the line, we suggest modeling a hundred thousand dollars for interest expense and $500,000.00 for taxes.  In turn, we plan to deliver $0.15 of diluted earnings per share off a base of 163 million diluted shares.  To put our improved performance outlook in better context, in fiscal 2006, we recorded $0.21s of diluted earnings per share.  In fiscal 2007, we posted $0.48 of diluted earnings per share.  Based on today\u2019s guidance, we are on track to deliver $0.32 for the first six months of fiscal 2008 or $0.64 annualized run rate.", "And given the trends we have outlined today, we anticipate an even stronger second half of fiscal 2008.  By every measure, our year is off to an excellent start and we look forward to updating you on our progress.", "That completes our prepared comments.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions.)", "Our first question will come from Amit Kapur from Piper Jaffray.", "Amit Kapur \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Thanks a lot guys and congratulations on the strong quarter.  Maybe we could just start off, obviously there is a lot of debate out there in terms of the nature of the macro environment, maybe if you could give your view on what you see in terms of levels of handset inventory out there?  What kind of your orderly times were doing exit in 2007?", "Dave Aldrich", "There are areas of weakness.  We have seen some areas in China for example on the low end, some pockets of infrastructure, a couple of customers are soft.  Unfortunately, we were ramping while weighing in a couple of others that are very strong even in the infrastructure requirement, although, I mean I must say that there has been nothing significant enough to move the dial overall at Skworks.", "In our case, we are seeing strength from our linear products.  We are seeing this average blended ASP content increase to begin to become a reality such that our ASPs are increasing in handsets and as you know, we are ramping some new customers we have acquired over the last six to nine months.  We do see pockets of weakness and some choppiness.  I think overall, the handset industry is relatively strong and we are picking up share.", "Amit Kapur \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great, maybe could you give us a sense of what linearity was during the December quarter, was it pretty normal?", "Liam Griffin", "Linearity was actually pretty normal for us as Dave outlined.  We have very good position now across each of the top five OEMS that we had good visibility exiting the quarter, and visibility looks decent now as we move into the market.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions.)", "We will next go to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equity Research", "Thanks a lot, good quarter.  Obviously, there is a lot of chatter that says about the macro environment, you mentioned China was an area of weakness.  We had BAMI (ph) from Antidigits and Ralph on TriQueen (ph) on an investor call yesterday, both seemed kind of upbeat about the end market strength in sheer gains, but clearly that everybody had given their share on the quarter and we are hearing about some relatively large share shifts especially in CEMA, so you mentioned you were picking up share, could you give us some kind of indication where you think you are gaining share, what technology, what OEMs and who are you gaining it from?  And then also, you have done really well at the largest handset OEM, have you leveraged your position there from 3G into their EDGE GSM businesses, or are you almost exclusively just 3G there?", "Dave Aldrich", "Let me comment on a couple, first, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we are shipping EDGE and WB and CDMA to all of our top-tier customers.  So we do not have customers that are buying just EDGE or just WB and CDMA, at least not among the top tier.  And the reason for that is pretty simple.  There is a real advantage to coupling the complicated filter and the multi-throw switch, the logic and control that drives in most cases multiple events of EDGE and then in Asia, you have bands, one, two, three or four bands of WB and CMDA, so there is a real current consumption size overall bill to material cost advantage.", "So most of these solutions are highly proprietary in custom, and they are a real win-win for OEM customers, so that is the answer there.  When we are seeing share gains is because we are now a pretty broad proxy as I mentioned in the prepared comments a couple of years ago, we are shipping to three of the five top customers.  We are now shipping to all five and we are shipping all modulations to all five virtually.", "Right now, we are beginning to see real growth as the industry increases and as the average content as there is more EDGE in 3G, the average content moves a dollar or two as opposed to several dollars a phone, so the blended that duck-tailing in of higher dollar content is causing us the increase.  So we are taking share by virtue of the fact that there are a few and discrete solutions and we have swept in more functions.  We are taking share by shipping to all five and of course linear products as an area of growth for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sujin daSilva with Kaufman Brothers.", "Sujin daSilva - Kaufman Brothers", "Congratulations on the quarter.   You talked about the share gains.  Can you talk about among the top five, which one do you think has the best share gain opportunity as we look at \u201908?", "Dave Aldrich", "What is tough for us to get into that kind of granularity, I think the phenomena of htier being more content is not specific to any one customer, so I believe that we will see a blended ASP increase as all of the top tiers are moving from a mix of emerging market low end as well as EDGE and WB-CDMA to varying degrees, so that phenomena includes across all customers.", "Clearly, the OEMs are sum-gaining from others, and so as we see that overall market dynamic, it were not pretty as I have said, pretty broad proxy for the overall industry an we would to see those OEMs who are gaining share as those OEMs gain share, that shifts some of our volume from OEM A to OEM B.", "Sujin daSilva - Kaufman Brothers", "Okay, great.  That helps, and then, just one quick follow up.  You have done well with Apple and some of the new products with the iPhone.  Do you have any update on the opportunities there are they refresh their product lines or perhaps some of the computing products that they have currently?", "Don Palette", "Oh yes, absolutely.  With respect to Apple as you may know, we really cannot speak in detail about that company, but we certainly pursue opportunities with all the major players both in notebook computing and also handsets and we encourage you guys to do your tier-downs and gain your insights from there.", "Sujin daSilva - Kaufman Brothers", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Aaron Hashaq with Morgan Stanley.", "Aaron Hashaq - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thanks for taking my questions.  I am happy to hear you guiding dollars flat in the March quarter, is that something that you think kind of hold it to your flat or just let growth beyond that even as you continue to grow the business in the second half of Fiscal \u201908 or how much gross should we look for?", "Don Pallette", "I would expect that there will be some slight growth.  If you look at our expense base, most of those cost are fixed, we have a great model in place that allows us certainly to leverage very effectively operating expenses, but there are some minor variable causes associated with some commissions and some volume related expenses, but I would say, you would not want to model any significant increases in our expenses on a go-forward basis.", "Aaron Hashaq - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then as you look at the factors that are better than normal seasonality in the March quarter, the share gains and the MediaTek, the ramp of your new tier one customers and some of the transitions to find the modules and Motorola low-end, which do you say is the biggest factor helping you offset seasonality.", "Don Palette", "Let me give the top two or three, one is in these newer applications with these adjacent markets and non-handsets.  It is less seasonality, so what we are seeing is a quarter where we are typically think of handsets as being seasonal, the markets were addressing either if they are seasonal and maybe a different season or they are not seasonal at all, so that scenario where we tend not to see that seasonality and as that business has grown, that has become a bigger impact for us.", "I would say the second is that we are beginning to see displacement of our business on the 2G side with more and more EDGE and more and more WB-CDMA where we sweep in the filters and switches, so I think you are starting to see that creep from relatively simple dual band power amplifier to a relatively complex multi-mode FEM, I would say that is number two.", "Operator", "Our next question is then from Todd Koffman with Raymond James.", "Todd Koffman \u2013 Raymond James", "Yes, just with regard to the weakness you have seen in Asia, can you give any more quantification on that since the number of other vendors has talked about that as well.", "Don Palette", "Let me try to clarify that.  I mean, it is obviously, I will use the word choppy for lack of a better word, I would say that what we are seeing today in China frankly is we have a large customer called MediaTek in China, they have lots of customers that are indigenous to the local branded OEMs within China and one of the things that we are seeing is that the supply chain constraints, we have been looking to fill and I think an underserved customer there, by filling that void.  We have been scaling up for that customer and working very hard to gain design wins and the challenge for us is to make sure that is a permanent share gain, and so that has been our goal and those are the discussions that we have been having with that customer.", "So, while I look at China, I think, the end handset sales across the industry are strong.  Again, there is some choppiness and that is one area where it is difficult to handicap it or take a beat on it because you are seeing some constraints and some share shift, which makes it difficult to quantify, but again, I do not believe it is a major issue.  I do not believe there are major pockets of inventory and our business in China, for \u201908 looks frankly quite strong.", "Operator", "Our next question, you will have to help me on your first name, last name is Kidron in Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Congratulations on a good quarter.  I had a couple of questions, Don, first to you.  What are you now starting to generate, how should we think about your net interest income for the quarter going forward, and Dave, can you comment on what would be seasonality for the handset market in your opinion as you hear it from your customers on an aggregate basis, of course on December to March, that will be interesting to hear.", "Don Palette", "Where we have been running right now and it has not had the cash balance at this point has not had a material impact on that is that we have a net interest expense and interest income of about 100K a quarter that is running.  You can start ramping that up a little bit as we move out to the year, but it is not a real material number for us at this point in time.  Should not have much of an impact on your model,  we do not expect that that is going to change dramatically.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "But this quarter though, I am missing $50 million off your balance sheet, if you generated $55 million, your cash balance went down almost offset by $49 million that you paid.  Where is the outlook that you generated?", "Don Palette", "We had the free scale acquisition as well as some selected patents and that was around $30 million.  That is the biggest piece of that.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "And Dave, if we go to the markets?", "Dave Aldrich", "I think a couple of OEMs have reported at this point, as you know there is a lot of information that will be coming in shortly for December of quarter end sales, from where we sit, the hub holes for us were strong, the visibility is quite good.  The order of linearity was about what we expected, so I would think you are looking at 10% or so sequential unit decline and there is some pockets I think accreting customers look very strong.  Our tier ones, the larger customers tend to be more typically seasonal, and in our case, China, we discussed why we are filling a need, and we have some very new entrance, there are some new customers for us REM being one and we are starting to see some of those customers.", "Actually, they look quite strong in the market.  So it is a bit of a mixed bag, but I cannot do any better, roughly the seasonality in the 10% range.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Caval with Lehman Brothers.", "Jeff Caval - Lehman Brothers", "I was wondering if you would refresh us a little bit on how your long-term margin structure is developing?  Previously, you said mid-40s margins and the $250 million quarter range.", "Don Palette", "Jeff, if you are referring to the business model that we talked about last quarter. I mean, I think first of all, if you take a look at where we have been on the last three or four quarters, we are making consistent progress on the margin front and we are very positive about that and it is really, from the product cost side, it is really being able to execute and focus on the blocking and tackling of margin improvement.  It is the material cost that we have been delivering the double digit material cost out year-over-year.  We are continuing improved product yields and we will continually improve the efficiencies and productivity in the factory.  Those things coupled with the volume, we feel very, very comfortable that we are going to be able to deliver margins in the low 40s and that is what the business model is based on and it will remind everybody, the model is about $240 million to $250 million in revenue about 42% margin, 23% office expenses which gets to about an 18% return.  That is our internal target.", "Dave Aldrich", "And our goal is how do we drive that to 20-points of operating income, we can see 18 and that is sort of doing the things we are doing today and our goal is through more linear products to continue to focus, can we get that number to 20% and that is what we have targeted ourselves internally.", "Jeff Caval - Lehman Brothers", "And then could I ask what the mix of linear was in this quarter?", "Dave Aldrich", "Both of our segments grew from the prior quarter and our linear mix is roughly consistent with what it was in the prior quarter and it is roughly 25% linear and 75% handset.", "Jeff Caval - Lehman Brothers", "And are you guys talking about the margin structure inside the linear business?", "Dave Aldrich", "No, we do not disclose that.  The margin structures are created by the overall results and that is the specific margins on that segment.", "Jeff Caval - Lehman Brothers", "Would you consider doing so at some point in the future?", "Dave Aldrich", "It is difficult for us, Jeff because we said in the prepared comments that the contribution margins are over 70%, but remember these products are using the same core technologies as our handset business, so we operate them in our same assembly facilities, our same external boundaries and internal boundaries, so for us, it is really a blend on the supply chain side.  The pricing tends to be higher to the contribution margin is 10 to 15 points higher.  But we really do not segment our business in terms of the full absorbed gross margin all the way through.", "Jeff Caval - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, that makes sense.  Thanks very much, Dave.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Jaroon Boss with UBS.", "Jaroon Boss - UBS", "Congratulations on a good quarter.  Two quick questions, can you maybe talk about linear into the March quarter what you feel there should represent in terms of total revenues, and as a follow up any assessments that you can mention for the quarter.", "Don Palette", "With respect to linear, we actually see linear going into March about flat.  It will not be subject to the seasonality that we see in handsets.  We are seeing some dynamics within LP moving around.  There are some infrastructure share shift.  Erickson has been a little bit light, but it has always picked up.  We have also diversified into a number of new markets as Dave outlined, energy management, satellite set-top boxes an others, but linear, at this point, it looks pretty strong going into March.  It should be roughly flat sequentially.", "Jaroon Boss - UBS", "Okay, great, and any 10% costs that you have mentioned?", "Dave Aldrich", "For the quarter, we had Sony Erickson and Samsung were both above 10% and Motorola was just slightly below 10% for the quarter.", "Jaroon Boss - UBS", "And a very quick follow up, amortization in the quarter jumped to 1.9 because of the free select positions, any new run rate we should model?", "Dave Aldrich", "Correct!  Two million a quarter.  That is directionally correct for the balance of the year, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question if from James Fawcett with Pacific Crest.", "James Faucette \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that have already been posed.  First of all, as far as the linear products business, how are you thinking about the economic sensitivity of that business, especially weighted to relative to handsets and how they traditionally shrug off any economic slow down or they have in the past?", "Dave Aldrich", "James, this business is maybe for a point of clarification, as I have mentioned, we have got, between two or three thousand, about 2500 part number skews and over now, a thousand customers and it is growing pretty rapidly and think of it is a catalog standard business, so we have got to catalog that is as thick as a phone book, not because we want to lug it around, but it is because it is a market where you take fundamental building blocks and then you characterize them across as many parameters as you can possibly think off so that they can be adapted in as many applications where we are seeing the business as a distribution base, broad catalog business, and then within that business, we have begun to identify vertical applications where the size and the margin warrants constant development or application specific development.  Liam and I have talked about a few of those.", "I know that these are quite different, energy management, I do not see as a seasonal business for example, automotive is seasonal, infrastructure is cyclical, albeit is not necessarily seasonal, but when you aggregate them all, this business has very, very low customer concentration, very low product concentration.  I hope that helps.", "James Faucette \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Well, actually, what I am asking is I am wondering how much more sensitive to just economic cycles do you think that business generally is.  I understand it is way more diversified across customer basis, but I am just wondering if you feel like it is more economically sensitive than the handset business?", "Dave Aldrich", "I do not think it is more economically sensitive to me, handset business.  Intuitively I would say that it is not, but again I have to really frankly step back and analyze the various pieces to try to understand that which is utility oriented or more discretionary and frankly I would be giving you a weak answer if I tried to quantify it.", "James Faucette \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Just a quick follow up on the free scale product acquisition, how much of a contribution was that in the December Quarter, firstly?  And secondly, are you producing those products internally as of yet, and if not, when do you plan to?", "Dave Aldrich", "It is hard, the materiality, it was immaterial for both our First Quarter and the Second Quarter.   There was no material impact on the revenue.  We expect that to change in the second half of the year and it will be a contributor as both REM and Motorola transition to our products and burn off some of their inventory.  So in the balance, the second half of the year, we are expecting to be more of the contributor.", "Don Palette", "So, when we blocked this business in addition to of the design, rights in the IP and the exclusive rights to work within their transceiver, where it is sold in those accounts, we did not buy finished goods, so that inventory and late stage finished goods is bleeding though the supply chamber.", "James Faucette \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Great, but are you already producing that internally yet or should we expect that to ramp in the second half?", "Dave Aldrich", "It is transitioning as we speak and we did not buy any fab assets, so it is transitioning to our foundry and being qualified as we speak and it will be on our production facilities in the second half.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Aalok Shah with the Credit Suisse.", "Aalok Shah \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I know most of my questions have been answered but just, I want to follow up a little bit on the linear products a little bit more.  It seems like, you guys have got into \u2013 down about 5% next quarter and I am trying to figure out if the margins are so much higher in the linear product\u2019s group.  Could we see gross bargains going up even above the 39.8% range?  Is that something that you guys are just conservative about right now or shouldn\u2019t we kind of start to see a little bit increase in the margins?", "Dave Aldrich", "I would look at that business.  It does have higher contribution margin as we have discussed substantially higher.  I think the share or percentage of the revenue in Q2 is not overly significant.  I think Kansas will be down less than seasonality.  I think we need our products ill be more flat and seasonal with a lot of embedded dynamics within this broad portfolio.  We are trying to be prudently conservative.  And so, we are pushing 40% at this point on a revenue base of a couple of hundred million and we feel very, very good about that.  There is an upside opportunity as we move in to Q3 and into Q4 and into 2009 for sure.", "Aalok Shah \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then David, can I follow up really quick on Casio?  What do your utilization rates are night now?", "Dave Aldrich", "Well our utilization and our internal factories are running well into the 80s and operating to below 90s.  We have bought some equipment on line that is being qualified as we speak.  We are transitioning to six inches and a lot of our equipment is in.  There are no bricks and water, so it is relatively inexpensive proposition.  But it doubles our true \u2013 and our existing boundaries, we are duck tailing that end but what is different about us is that we do have fully qualified suppliers for all of our major.  Where we are vertically integrated, we have copy of the exact fully qualified suppliers on the outside who are ramping to varying degrees so we have an ability to address a lot of upside demands without having to get out in front of the high end of all of our customer\u2019s curve by being totally vertically integrated.  We like that high breed model a lot and I think it is going to serve us very well and our investors well over the next 2, 3, 4 to 5 years.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Craig Ellis with Citigroup.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Citigroup", "I want to drill down into gross margins a little bit more.  It looks like the business is developing a profile where margins are a little bit flattish in the first part of the calendar year and then you get some uplift in the back half of the year.  In December, we are up 130 basis points versus December of last year.  So, the questions is, is that the profile that you think is starting to manifest in the business and secondly, as we look out to where we will be exiting, I think you can get the same type of gross margin improvement over the next four quarters as you did within the last four.", "Dave Aldrich", "Maybe Don and I can answer this together.  It is very revenue dependent and overall our yields are improving are improving across the product portfolio into varying degrees.  We are shipping more linear products with more diversified, more dollar content and front-end modules. So, there is a trend towards higher margin as we work those products into a fixed cost structure.  And in the second half of the year, you said, one half of the answer \u2013 it is volume dependent.  The second half of the year was the growth comments that we have made and where we see our business moving.  Higher revenue will translate into higher margin.  And as Don just mentioned, you know the 42% range is what we have stated publicly, 18% operating income at 240 to 250.  we are now at a 210 run rate we just think that with a quarter $210 run rate we have got a lot of upside capacity rooms so we have not talked specifically about when we will intersect with that margin, think of it that way, at $242.50 we are on 18% operating income with over a couple of hundred basis point higher gross margin.", "Don Palette", "And it also makes more sense to when you are looking at margins as you sort to have to take it off on where we are and our most recent run race, because year-over-year comparisons can get muddy by what day, depending on the mix and where you are in the volume.  So I think it is a much easier model to try and work off of recent quarters and project where you think that benefit is going to be on a go-forward basis from there.  I just think it makes a lot more sense.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay that is reasonable.  And then a follow up on the linear business and really more a detail, typically, when we think about a linear business, we think of one that is about 50% through distribution, 50% direct sales.  How should we think about the direct versus distribution mix in your business?", "Dave Aldrich", "Well, we have a similar dynamic here.  We have world wide distributors and even third party sales reps.  So that does pick up, I would say, for us it might be about 60% of the business.  Where we actually have lots of smaller customer\u2019s portfolio, and then we have more or less global account opportunities with larger companies like Erickson, Nokia, Siemens, and while we go with the direct sales team.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Citigroup", "I know you guys have talked about a number of new products that were hitting the portfolio in the middle of \u201907.  Is that what we are seeing now?  The growth in the linear business being fueled in part by what you are doing on the customer diversification side but in part, based on the success of the new products that were brought out mid last year.", "Liam Griffin", "Yes absolutely, and as Dave outlined, we have a couple of thousand skews and we developed a fresh setof analog and mixed signal devices in the last calendar year, about a hundred devices or so.  So we are moving in a new segment like energy management where we have very costumed DCO synthesizers, PLLs, frond-end modules are integrated together to form a very unique R solution.  We are starting to move forward into automotive; we talked about cable TV and Desktop.  So it is a combination of new products and also expansion to some of these interesting vertical markets.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Pierre Maccagno of Needham & Company.", "Pierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham & Company", "Could you give an approximate breakdown of your 2G versus 3G and how each of those grew?  Also, if you can give us an update on Helios, where the customers growing?", "Dave J. Aldrich", "If you look at the next, the 3G business is larger right now.  You know, you know obviously a cheap \u2013 and CD business was about 60% with WCDMA being the balance.", "Pierre Maccagno \u2013 Needham & Company", "And how did those particularly grow?", "Don W. Palette", "Well obviously, there are dynamics involved.  The 2G market is being fueled by new subscribers in China and India and we have had some strength there with a conflict media attack but the real growth is really occurring in WCDMA and WCDMA for lots of Dave\u2019s outline really means that WCDMA product coupled with an edge device.  That is really the architecture that we are pursuing in getting design traction on those.  We moved into March and each quarter in 2008 \u2013 growth in WCDMA and Edge Devices.", "Dave Aldrich", "On Helios today is a little bit under 5% of our total revenue, and just keep in mind, just to remind you, we have talked about this in the past few quarters.  We have a small very focused team that are dedicated to serving our RF needs for both our linear products business infrastructure, new broader catalog, some applications specific devices as well as handsets because there are subset of handset OEM that are looking for a multimode power amplifier switch built resolution with a stand-along transceiver to make with their chosen baseman support.  So, in our business it is always 100% of the time that our frond-end module is made into a stand-along transceiver.", "Operator", "Our next question is from a VJ, Brian Murdock of Georgia bank.", "Brian Murdock \u2013 Georgia Bank", "A question on Nokia, did you see the gains you had in the quarter coming from perhaps on yield issues\u2014editors in that company, or you see these as design wins and share games that you see is sustainable over the next year or two, thanks.", "Dave Aldrich", "Well, again we are a little bit handicapped here because we cannot speak specifically about our customers.  I think you understand that, but Brian I would say that at a higher level.  It is not so much the case that we are taking share from a specific company.  It is more the transition of the market and the need, the underserved need in the market to have a company that can feel a pretty complex set of technology in a frond-end solution that provides the harmonics, the current consumption size and overall bill of material cost.  In the case of a large OEM with a sophisticated architecture, the design window to enter a platform is measured in years, Brian.  It is two to three years so it is not a sort of an opportunistic play.  It is a custom, these customers tend to buy a custom \u2013 proprietary that a platform base and there is all sorts for that platform.", "Brian Murdock \u2013 Georgia Bank", "Or could be that the shift to WB-CDMA and Nokia is good news for you.", "Dave Aldrich", "I think the shift to anybody, the EDGE, WEDGE, and WB-CDMA is great news for us.", "Operator", "Our last question is a follow up from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equity Research", "Dave you mentioned, you have got a lot of external qualified vendors to help you address outside the demand efficiency without having a lot of additional costs like some of your competitors did.  That does not come for free though.  Obviously, margins there will not be as good as the intruders and internally, any feeling at all if we see \u2013 picking the man we should see a pinch to my margin somewhat, what would you suffer by doing that and then secondly, you said free scales of product line will start at the second half of \u201908.  This is obviously going to be much faster ramp than just the new products.  You have Motorola and 0 out there burning off finished good inventory when they are done.  TheY are going to come to you for the product.  So, should we expect some sort of maybe not a hockey stick but to step up in the second half of the year as you start producing that to customers that are already built in.", "Dave Aldrich", "Okay, let me compartmentalize that a bit, with respect to the Foundry parts, it is a little bit different than thinking about it on if you are, for example on sea moss environment where you go out in a merchant market, you are paying the best possible price, you can then you look to drive yields and further materials cost reductions overtime to negotiation process.  In this case, when we have done the Gallium-arsenide side it is quite a bit different.  We have taken our process our IP, our quality people, our designers.  Our device people and we have done an absolute copy exact on the very stringent contractual requirements to actually bring up a partner into volume production with MRP links and also it looks and feels and smells to our people just like what we produced internally.  And because we have that  kind of a relationship and we are dealing with supplies who have a different cost structure and operate it in lower cost parts of the world at much different costing.  We are able to get pricing because of this arrangement that is remarkably close to our internal cost.  So we do not suffer a gross margin reduction if that is your point.", "In this case, it is very different.  You are right.  If we would have to go outside and say well let us not buy a lot of packages outside and having the fun that there are gross margin requirements and their cost of capital then there is obviously flexibility advantage offset by gross margin but in the case of the boundaries it is quite different.  I am sorry, would you repeat the second half of the question.", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equity Research", "In the free scale, you mentioned it is going to contribute in the second half of this year as your two big customers, one roll on a rim, burn off their finished good in the door.  Shouldn\u2019t we be modeling maybe not a hockey stick increase but some significant stepup in revenue because it is not like you are ramping a new product that has \u2013 and sell.  You have got people in stall based incumbent customers that will start ordering it from you again.", "Dave Aldrich", "I think the absence of specific guidance from us in the second half, I think your intuition is right.  It is a faster transition and we do expect it to be a contributor in the second half.  So, I think your point that it would ran faster than your normal design when it is true.", "Operator", "We do have one final question.  It is Mike Burton with Think Equity Partners.", "Mike Burton \u2013 Think Equity Partners", "I need to talk a little bit about your contribution margin in WCDMA and Edge or Wedge compared to GSM.", "Don Palette", "GSM is much more mature so we are producing enormous volumes there.  The yields have been coming up very quickly and Wideband CDMA and remarkably they are quite close the Wideband CDMA gross margins are very good once you get them into the north of 85% yield and that is where we begun to drive them.  We are not there across the portfolio but they are increasing in a semiconductor learning curve that we understand, I think quite well but test times are coming down so utilization comes in much more volume to any given step in the process and so the contribution margins today are quite similar, overall, over time, the gross margin in our entire business, the blend of gross margin increases because we simply have more dollar content driving not only higher utilization but there is a fixed cost element to our cost of sales.  So, on a product by product base it depends upon where we are in the yield learning curve and unfortunately products that are launching are launching the way we would expect them to.", "Mike Burton \u2013 Think Equity Partners", "Supposed the OEMs that are reported to have spoken optimistically about 3G in \u201908, can you provide us some insight on your own estimates for 3G next year or perhaps what percent of sales you see that becoming?", "Don Palette", "Yes, absolutely, Sony Erickson, and Samsung have both recorded pretty much in line and you are correct that it did report favorably on 3G or WCDMA , we see that clearly as the fastest growing segment of the market and as we have outlined before, for us, I do not think we have a case where we have the WCDMA part without an EDGE and largely in EDGE, FEM made it to that 3G band or multiple bands.", "If you look at the numbers, \u201907, we think it is about $180 million 3G phones worldwide in the 1.1 billion and that number is going to well into the high twos, maybe as high as three hundred million next year.", "Operator", "And with that, this does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session, I would like to turn the conference back to David Aldridge for our closing comments.", "Dave Aldridge", "Thank you very much.

(Operator Instructions). ", "Thomas Schiller", "Joining me today are Dave Aldridge, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Palette, our Chief Financial Officer, and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing.  ", "Dave will begin today\u2019s call with a business overview followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook.  We will then open the lines for your questions.  Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.  I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we have used in the past.  Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.  I will now turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "Dave Aldrich", "Thanks Tom, and welcome everyone. Today we announced our second fiscal quarter 2008 results and I am pleased to report that the Skyworks team posted solid performance highlighted by increasing diversification by market share gains and dollar content coupled with strong operational execution. Now specifically during the quarter we delivered $202 Million in revenue.  This is ahead of our guidance and substantially better than market seasonality.  We expanded our gross margins to $40.3 %.  This is a 200 basis point increase year over year and our fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. We increased our net income by 52% from $16.7 Million last year to $25.3 Million in Q2.  At the same time we delivered earnings per share of $.16.  This was a penny ahead of consensus and a 60% growth on a year over year basis.  We generated $40 million of cash flow from operations.  This set of improving fundamentals reflects the strength of our new business model and is particularly important given the current market environment.  In many respect Skyworks has entered a new and exciting phase, and by way of background throughout 2006 and 2007 we increased our focus and investment in our core linear products business, leveraging analog and mixed-signal technologies in support of a very broad set of adjacent markets.  Now in parallel we directed our handset efforts squarely on the top tier OEMs and on the top base-band providers.  With clear and measureable for share gains through each and every customer.  As a result today we are poised to deliver sustainable above-market growth and improving profitability without the headwinds of a low-return base band business or reliance on one or two customers.  Our confidence is based on several key strategies which I first outlined as you recall last quarter.  I would like to spend some time today providing an update on our progress along each of these four initiatives.  ", "The first being that we are diversifying Skyworks.  We are leveraging our catalogue business and our world-wide distribution network.  We are expanding into a broader set of end markets.  These end-markets include broadband, industrial, medical, computing, wireless networking, cellular infrastructure.  Keep in mind today that we support nearly one thousand customers and over 2,500 product SKUs.  This list continues to grow with each new customer engagement and is back by an expanding product pipeline.  ", "And to get a little bit more granular, more specifically during the quarter we added a new suite of low-power RF solutions targeting ISM or Industrial Scientific and Medical applications.  We ramped production of an integrated RF system which Samsungs award-winning FEMTO cell based stations.  We launched programmable solutions for Harris\u2019 Metropolitan point-to point infrastructure.  We introduced custom control ICs to a leading supplier of automotive entertainment and navigation appliances. We also won designs at CISCO with wireless LAN access solutions leveraging our switch and filter capabilities.  We ramped game block amplifier for intelligent energy management deployments and we increased shipments of RF subsystems and Siemens in support of remote maintenance traffic systems vending management applications; telemetry, basically.  ", "And speaking of Siemens, our Transtek subsidiary providing advanced ceramic materials in support of their gas turbine power business for low-cost energy.  Now in parallel to these examples of analog market growth we are aggressively also diversifying in our handset business.  Now as you may recall in 2005 our revenues were heavily concentrated with three of the top five OEMs, whereas today we are shipping both highly specialized 2G front end modules, or merging market fends, as well as higher value added Edge or CDMA fends to the world leading handset suppliers. I think of particular note- we believe that we are the only PAFEM supplier in high volume production across all T01 Handset OEMs as well as the two leading Smartphone suppliers.  ", "Now secondly we are delivering higher margin product.  With the development and introduction of a host of new, highly customized solutions we have created a product portfolio that is characterized not only by product life cycles and almost annuity like revenue profiles, but also a higher contribution margin.  The transition is occurring on multiple levels including again our standard catalogue products and custom analog and RF solutions in new markets while on the handset side with front end modules for System on a chip or SOC applications where there is an emerging requirement for higher integration.  This is a result of some base band petitioning trends.  And finally multi-mode front end modules.  Now across the board both our handset and our new linear products customers place high value on our architectures that reduced size, that reduced billed materials complexity, that improved reliability and enhanced performance, while enabling competitive cost structures.  Our customer place as very high premium on these functions and its at the intersection of what we believe we do very well.  ", "Our third initiative is that we are capitalizing on the increase in handset front end module content.  The migration to 3G multi-mode, that is Edge, Wedge, wide band CDMA from voice centric phones is happening.  Further during the quarter we introduced the industries first front end module for long-term evolution or LTE 3.9G applications.  With this trend the complexity of the front end module significantly increases expanding our addressable content by threefold.  The reason frankly is that the phones have a need for backward compatibility with installed networks.  There\u2019s a requirement to manage multiple standards and frequency within the same device and the inclusion of broad-band functionality allowing music, data and video.  The integration of these various bands for reliable high-speed access requires complex modules which must remain physically small, power efficient and cost effective.  This complexity is creating an incremental RF market opportunity measured in the billions of dollars.  Now at the same time while we are talking about WEDGE and wide band CDMA and all, and this might be a little bit counter-intuitive, the emerging market is moving aggressively toward low-cost system on chip solutions but this SOC migration is placing a higher burden on the front end given the digital functionality that is being merged into the digital base band device.  In other words our addressable opportunity increases with the move to SOC on the low end.  ", "So with ramps in various stages of progress across all tier one handset OEMs Skyworks is positioned to gain further share in the FEM products segment.  The competitive landscape is narrowing with fewer and fewer suppliers able to support both the technical requirements and the manufacturing scale required by the leading handset OEMs.  This dynamic has the very real side benefit of stabilizing the industries pricing environment.  I guess I would encourage you to think of it this way.  If by increasing the functionality at the front end Skyworks adds more value while at the same time saving our customers development time and lowering their overall costs, a true win-win scenario.  ", "Fourth and finally, we are executing operationally. Our world-wide operations team is intensely focused on continuing improvements in yields, in equipment efficiency, in cycle times and return on investment capital.  We are extremely metrics driven within our Newberry Park, Mexicali and Woburn factories and have effectively implemented a hybrid manufacturing model leveraging multiple external foundries and partnerships.  Now this unique approach allows us to maintain high internal capacity utilization by creating second sources for high-fixed cost services like foundry and like assembly.  This model provides us with supply chain flexibility, lower overall capital investment, as well as the ability to meet upside demand.  The benefits of this out-sourcing approach now three years in the making are beginning to show in our improving performance and the crossing of the 40% gross margin threshold last quarter, a key step to reaching our long-term profitability targets.  So to recap, our second quarter performance demonstrates progress in our four initiatives.  One, we are diversifying our company as we penetrate new adjacent markets and add new handset customers. Two, we are delivering higher margin products.  Three we are capitalizing on the increase in front end module content and four we are executing operationally.  I will now turn the call over to Don for his review.", "Donald Palette", "Thank you Dave.  Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was $201.7 Million, up 12% year over year ahead of our guidance of $200 Million dollars and better than market seasonality.  Gross profits for the quarter were $81.4 Million, or 40.3% of revenue, a 200 basis point year over year expansion, 50 basis point improvement sequentially, and better than our guidance for sequentially flat gross margin on a percentage basis.  This performance is a testament to our focus on margin improvement.  Our continuous expansion over the last four quarters reflects higher equipment and labor efficiencies at all of our factories; progress on yield improvement initiatives; double digit year over year material costs reductions.  Operating expenses were $55.5 Million of which R&D expenses total $34 Million and SG&A costs were $21.5 Million.  As a result, our operating income for the quarter was $25.9 Million up 47% year over year and representing a 13% operating margin. Our net interest income and other income for the quarter was $114,000, while taxes were $696,000 at approximately our 3% cash tax rate.  Net income was $25.3 Million, yielding $.16 of earnings-per-share, 1 penny ahead of our consensus estimates.  Now turning to the balance sheet.  ", "We exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $228.5 Million.  During the quarter we recorded $11.1 Million of depreciation, generated $40.4 Million in cash flow from operations, and invested $17.5 Million in demand driven capital expenditures. Primarily for FAB and assembly and test capacity.  Successfully converting our improved earnings profile and business fundamentals into cash flow continues to be an area of emphasis for the Skyworks management team.  As a result over the past three quarters alone we have generated $126 Million of cash flow from operations.  Now to our business outlook for the third fiscal quarter.", "As Dave has underscored, based on new product ramps and leading handset customers and continued end-market diversification we are experiencing healthy demand and accelerating growth through continued crisp execution to our operating plan we expect to further expand both gross and operating margins. Assuming revenue of $210 Million which is incidentally a20% growth on a year over year basis we suggest modeling a gross margin of 40.5% and operating expenses slightly above $57 Million.  Below the line we suggest modeling interest expense and income from offsetting one another, and $700,000 for taxes.  In turn we intend to deliver $.17 of diluted earnings per share off a base of 163 million shares, a 55% year over year improvement in bottom line performance. To put our proved performance in better context it\u2019s worth noting that in fiscal 2006 we reported $.21 of diluted earnings per share; in fiscal 2007 we posted $.48 for the entire year; and for the first six months of fiscal 2008 we\u2019ve already delivered $.33 and by virtue of our guidance for $.17 cents this quarter we are now on a $.68 annual IDPS run rate. With further improvements in store during the back half of 2008 and into 2009 by every measure 2008 is off to an excellent start.  That completes our prepared comments.  Operator, please open the lines for the question and answer session.", "Question \u2013and- Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Our first question will come from Ator Swandberg with Thomas Weisel.  Actually we\u2019ve opened up Aalok Shah.", "", "Aalok Shah- D.A. Davidson", "Hi guys, can you hear me?  Just a quick question for you.  First on the margin front. You\u2019ve hit the 40% kind of goal.  Where do you think the stretch is now and where do you think we can end up by the end of the year?  ", "David Aldrich", "We\u2019ve hit 40.3% and we think the margins will pick up again in the June quarter, and we would expect as we continue to ship these higher margin, higher value-added products both in our handset and diversified linear products you will see some accretion in gross margin.  So they will improve as we move throughout 2007.  We have been encouraging you to think about a business that runs in the 42% gross margin range and about $250 Million in revenue and with an OperEx profile that grows much more slowly than revenue.  We think that would get us into the very high teens in operating income as a percentage of sales. ", "", "Aalok-Shah - D.A.Davidson", "Thanks, Dave.  And just a quick question on the front end module front, kind of tell us where you\u2019re at, what the landscape looks like for you guys and where do you think you\u2019re taking some shares?  Is it mostly 3G side of things, I know you mentioned some SOC designs as well.  Can you kind of share what\u2019s going on in that space?", "David Aldrich", "Liam and I will kind of answer that question in tandem.  First I would say the general trend that we outlined in the prepared comments is that we are learning as we engage our base band partners over a longer period of time that the SOC is driving some interesting specs and opportunity for more integrated front end modules on the low end.  That\u2019s a function of the base band integration with analog and essentially a CMOS process. On the higher end it is all about multiple frequencies and the challenge of filtering, switching, and amplifying across several bands if not many bands.  So the general trend is higher Asps on the mid-to-high end, but an interesting emerging trend on the low end as well is a front end module not a simple, cheap, discreet PA. ", "Liam Griffin", "Right, and the diversity comment that Dave outlines is very important.  We are shipping now to all the top tier OEMS and are in a great position to capture any of the share shifts that you may see across that market.  ", "Aalok Shah- D.A. Davidson", "And are the BAW filters that you are shipping into these, or are these \nLiam Griffin\nWell actually we have BAW, the majority of the products we have today in the FPM category are gallium arsenide products coupled with PHEMP switching.  We are now folding in the internal BAW capabilities particularly in some of the WCDMA devices that you\u2019ll see shipping this quarter and throughout the year.  \nDavid Aldrich\nAnd that\u2019s particularly on the high end or the high band we find Bulk acoustic is a small and elegantly simple way to effectively filter at a low cost and high performance.  \nOperator\nOur next question will come from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.  \nIttai Kidron- Oppenheimer\nCongratulations on good results. Dave, wanted to look a little bit closer at the sequential trends both from a historical going from a quarter back and also for your guidance going a quarter forward.  With regards to the June guidance $210 Million- that\u2019s only an eigth and change millionth sequential improvement.  I am assuming that one or two million out of that is your linear business that continues with the step ups.  Nokia keeps on ramping, another one to the very least.  Is it fair to say that most of the other businesses you are expecting kind of flat?  Can you go a little bit more color by the OEMs by which ones you expect to be a little bit more positive for you contributing in June versus where you are a little bit more cautious?\nDavid Aldrich\nI would say that it is our intent to be conservative incredible in our guidance, and so we attempt to that each and every quarter.  So having said that as a back drop we are a little unique as we mentioned in the prepared comments we do think we are the only company today in high-volume production across all the OEM;s and most of the second tiers including some emerging Smartphone suppliers.  So we didn\u2019t decline as much in March, as you know we declined much less in our handset business than the market seasonality and this diversification is allowing us to actually be in a unique position where we clearly see and are no immune from OEM share-shifts.  We see some OEMs are down, some OEMs are up, some OEMs are flat or right on target.  The net effect though is that we seen and OEM lose a share, chances are at this point we are actually beginning to see a pick-up with another OEM.  I think the general comment would be a combination of wanting to be prudent in our guidance in a choppy market, of being confidant in growth, of having high visibility to that guidance, and being quite diversified in the overall handset space. \nIttai Kidron- Oppenheimer\nVery good.  So let me drill a little bit into that. Are you as optimistic as you\u2019ve been a quarter ago about your ramp with Nokia, just considering the make-shift that they have suggested on their last earnings call with they see a little bit more of the low end being much more stronger and some softness on the high end where you guys have most of your design activity, correct me if I\u2019m wrong. \nDavid Aldrich\nYeah, we appreciate the question. We really can\u2019t get into the specific question about the customer that you outline but that\u2019s our commitment to that company.  But I will tell you that we are very bullish about the programs that we outlined last quarter, we continue to see share gains as we move throughout the year and we don\u2019t see anything really that will impact our success as we\u2019ve outlined in the past. \nOperator\nOur next question is from Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus.\nCody Acree- Stifel Nicolaus\nHey guys, and congratulations.  I know there is only a limited amount that you can say about Nokia, but obviously this has been the topic of conversation lately with not just yourselves but several larger players. Can you talk about where you\u2019re making in-roads, whether it be 2G, 2.5G, 3G, is it across the board, do you have any geographic comments you can make there with Nokia?\nDonald Palette \nI think that without getting into customer specifics, where as we mentioned we have to honor those client confidentiality agreements, we are seeing strength in 2G and in Edge, we are seeing strength with our SOC-based bandwidth suppliers, and with the front-end modules, they are some pretty slick devices, both from a size footprint as well in overall performance and functionality.  So we are seeing strength in the low end.  Edge Wedge we did see a shift in the last quarter with a bit more of the mid-to-low end, a bit less of the high end, so we did see that occurrence in the market.  But in general where we are seeing growth is in reference designs, with base-band companies like QUALCOMM, in markets where they in the past have been using perhaps somebody else\u2019s wide- band CMA device, a competitors device, maybe they had a discreet quad-band Edge implementation, where now we\u2019re offering a more complete RF Front End Systems so we\u2019re seeing strength there.  We\u2019re seeing strength again at the very top tier OEMs as they migrate to their new highly customized multi-mode architectures while at the same time getting a little closer to the base band folks on the mid-to-low end where we\u2019re kind of partnering into our R&D activities. So it\u2019s bifurcating between a high-end and highly customized OEM driven front end for Wedge, and a system that\u2019s custom designed with an SOC partner for the mid-to-low end.  And that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the growth. \nCody Acree- Stifel Nicolaus\nGreat, and then maybe staying at that high level, do you have obviously your gain share and obviously you\u2019re having a lot of things that are ramping that are coloring your optimistic view.  Can you take a step back and look at the wireless industry as a whole outside of maybe just what you are seeing and hearing maybe what your customers are saying, and comment on inventory health, demand trend health, and just the kind of backdrop you are participating in?\nDavid Aldrich\nCody, I think that if you think about the market this way, our crystal ball is no better than our customers, obviously not as good, but we dial in around a 10% maybe better year over year overall unit growth.  Typically that means maybe 10%012% or maybe 13% down in March.  Now we were down less than that for some of those reasons we just cited, and then June maybe you get a half of that back, a few points back, and then September is usually a very strong quarter and December is obviously the very strongest quarter. We don\u2019t see anything altering our view of that trend.  We don\u2019t see inventory issues out there that are worth mentioning, that are moving the dial at all.  We do see OEM share-shifts and we have seen some infrastructure softness, we\u2019ve seen some shift to the low end versus the high end, and of course we see that in our business and we factor that into our guidance.  So overall I think pretty strong unit growth, but in the end the overall trend is going to be, we think, from a smaller subset of front end suppliers capturing a lot more dollar content simply driven by the need for scale for engineering capability, because these are complicated devices and manufacturing cost structures that allow you to support those road maps.  So I think the overall trend will be a lot of top-tier volume being generated across virtually everybody as well as linear products portfolio that continues to grow sequentially.  \n\nDonald Pallette\nAnd the other thing to note here is that the emerging market trends are meaningful because they are adding a substantial subscriber base, and so the subscriber base now is well above 3 billion. It will approach 4 billion very soon, and those customers will then upgrade.  So when we start to move into 3G in the next several years, the baseline for replacement rates goes way up.  \n\nOperator\nOur next question is from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.\nEdward Snyder- Charter Equity Research\nThank you. Good quarter guys. Several housekeeping questions here.  How large was linear on the quarter?  I think you were looking at about 30% last quarter.  Did we grow on that, or where are we on Linear?  And what kind of contribution did you get from your free scale RF business, as well as anything at R.I.M. yet?  I know that is following later in the year but how big was R.I.M. if anything, for you?\nDonald Palette\nEd, this is Don.  Linear Products was up slightly from Q1 to Q2 but it is roughly a quarter of the overall sales of the business which is consistent with what it was in Q1, so I don\u2019t know where you got the 30% number. It\u2019s roughly a quarter of the business.\nDavid Aldrich\nIf I can add, you asked questions about Freescale, to refresh your memory we acquired Freescale for patents IP as well as some exclusive design rates into Motorola and Research in Motion.  We are transitioning our Research in Motion designs from Freescale designs and factories to Skyworks as we speak.  The real value is that it does increase our position at Research In Motion which was a real target strategic customer of ours, so we are seeing more business at Research in Motion.  We were in a minority position a couple of quarters ago.  We expect to be the majority, and across all standards, at Research in Motion by the June/September timeframe.  \nEdward Snyder- Charter Equity Research\nI guess maybe a sharper version of the same question, I wasn\u2019t looking at what you acquired from Freescale, but the slots that you won at Motorola and Research In Motion are going to hopefully provide incremental sales opportunities that will generate incremental revenue, and it sounds like Research in Motion is going to be mid-year or later and what about Motorola?  I know you had plug-and-play designs because you were second source to Skyworks on a lot of those designs, did any of that show up in this period, or should we just plan for that the second half of the year?\nLiam K. Griffin\nRight now those designs are still being ramped, so it\u2019s more of a second half of the year impact, specifically with Motorola.  They have outlined some of the Research in Motion portfolio and we\u2019re seeing launches more toward the near term.\n\nDonald Palette\nMotorola needed to work through some Freescale inventory that was part of the transaction.  We didn\u2019t take finished goods, so they have been doing that, and Research In Motion on the other hand was a faster conversion, really dictated by the recertification or requalification of their customers. So we saw some of that in this quarter, some more in June, and more again in September.  I hope that answers the question.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Suji De Silva with Kaufman Brothers. And by accident there, we are returning to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity.\nEdward Snyder- Charter Equity Research\nThanks, 10 % customers on the quarter, and Dave you are talking about long-term and much slower growth and effects on revenues that you get in the high double digits, is that 2009 type timeframe or should we start seeing that perhaps in the next quarter or two?\nDonald Palette\nThe top 10% customers were Sony Ericsson, Samsung and Motorola.  \nDavid Aldrich\nWith respect to that target of high teens, we are moving from the low to the mid teens as we speak, that\u2019s a position we will step through here relatively quickly.  We haven\u2019t guided out that far Ed as you know, but if the market is going to be up maybe a little more than 10% we will grow faster than the market in 2008. We believe we will grow faster than the market in 2009, and we will continue to see the Linear Products chugging along with incremental and sequential revenues, so I think if you model it that way we expect to see sequential growth each quarter and in both of those businesses at something that\u2019s something pretty materially higher than the overall market growth rate for the trends we have discussed.  \nOperator\nAnd we will go to Suji De Silva with Kaufman Brothers\nSuji De Silva- Kaufman Brothers\nHi guys.  Can you hear me now? So, real quick on the mix shift on the industry going from high=end to low-end, Dave how should we think about your content in low-end versus high-end, and particularly as Smart Phones start to wrap up here, maybe your content opportunities there as well?\nDavid Aldrich\nWell, I think that the content on the low-end, on the 2G CDMA for example, those parts had been driven to a pretty well fairly low cost structure- well sub-a-dollar.  And when we think about the front-end module, they are well over a dollar, they are not two, but they are well over a dollar and when we move into Edge, which is mid and in some markets low-end, it\u2019s in the $2-2.5- or .60, and wide band CDMA, depending on the number of bands.  If it\u2019s a band one with and Edge FPM it\u2019s maybe a $3-3.50, and you can add a buck and a quarter or so, a buck thirty-five per band of wide-band CDMA depending upon the implementations. So it runs anywhere from $3.50 or so to as much as $6.  \nSuji De Silva- Kauman Brothers\nAnd would Smartphone\u2019s be at the higher end there?\nDavid Aldrich\nIt depends upon the network for the Smartphone. If the Smartphone is an Edge only it would be similar in that $2-3, if it is wide-band CDMA , designed to be a Worldphone it would be on the high end of that range, around $5 or so. It\u2019s really not a lot different for us. It\u2019s the same front end analog functionality, it\u2019s just how many bands, how much filtering, how much switching, and how many bands of amplification are required in the system. \nSuji De Silva- Kaufman Brothers.\nOk, that is what I was getting at.  And then also, on the mixed analog versus the handset part, where were the gross margins?  And if you can\u2019t discuss that quantitatively, what were the trends and what do you think the drivers are for each of the gross margins of the second?\nDonald Palette\nWell, we don\u2019t disclose the margins segment, as we\u2019ve consistently said the margins in our linear product business are ceded to the overall business, but clearly with 75% of our revenue coming from the handset market a lot of the improvement we are seeing operationally, both product yields, factory efficiencies and material costs all relate to the handset business.  So we are seeing movement in both sides of this.  It\u2019s not just a mixed shift that\u2019s driving this, its real operational improvement.  We can\u2019t move the margins in this direction without getting benefits in handsets as well.  There\u2019s really good performance on both sides. \nDavid Aldrich\nI\u2019ll give you an example, just as an anecdote.  On the very low end, these front end modules have very attractive gross margins, we\u2019ve been able to drive die-size low, we\u2019ve been able to sweep in some analogue functionality, put it in a very small footprint with a low profile, which is very important, size and current consumption, very, very important.  And it a misnomer and perhaps counter-intuitive that on the low end of the market that perhaps they would suffer and they would be poor margins. That\u2019s not the case at Skyworks, we\u2019re running a lot of scale, a lot of volume, highly vertically integrated for those particular devices including packaging, assembly and tests, and PHEMPT and AHP and for the margins, the margins are very strong, and we run some of those product yields that are in the high nineties.  So we like that low-end, maybe counter-intuitive again, but we like the low-end a lot from a margins standpoint. \nOperator\nNext question is from Sanjay Devankin with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjay Devankin- Morgan Stanley\nHi guys, thank you for taking my question.  Congratulations on the quarter.  Just a quick question first off, specifically on the Asian handset market, I was just wondering if you could provide us some color on how your relationship is with the incumbent suppliers and media techs from Asia.  I know you have a garbled so if you could provide any color there I would really appreciate it. \nDavid Aldrich\nYes, absolutely.  First of all we\u2019re very focused on the impact market of China and also Taiwan, our relationship with MediaTek is also quite strong, we\u2019ve developed a portfolio of low-end products much like Dave outlined, and include now for the most part, FPM\u2019s that are gallium- arsenide products with a switch, ASP\u2019s have come a bit on that, but their value has come up.  We think the market for China is still going to be very strong this year, there was some volatility toward the end of December and into the early part of March, but the outlook looks very strong for the rest of the year.  Spreadtrum is a smaller player as you know, doing more TD-SCDMA, we are working with them, the revenues are a bit smaller than MediaTek but also important an account to stay focused on, so we are bullish in that market that we think, as we mentioned, that the emerging segment is critical for the industry, and we\u2019re well-positioned to capitalize.  \nSanjay Devankin \u2013 Morgan Stanley\nJust a quick follow-up, if I may.  On your linear products business, how should we view that long-term in terms of long-term growth?  How do you view that just for modeling purposes.  What kind of growth do you expect from that, year on year, or what is reasonable to expect from that business?\nDavid Aldrich\nThat is a great question.  That business has all been grown organically, we really began an intensified focus moving from what has been a wireless infrastructure business primarily into a more diversified set of end-markets, first with catalog standards and then into some identified adjacent markets, we\u2019ve mentioned a few in our prepared comments.  And back in early 2006 we were a little over $20 Million a quarter as I recall, 2007 we intersected $30 Million, late 2007 to early 2008 we exceeded $40 Million of revenue per quarter, and I think that by the time we get to the end of 2008 or early 2009 we will be intersecting with $50 Million a quarter, or a $200 Million run rate.  So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about that business.  It\u2019s a lot of singles and doubles, not the $20 Million orders you get in the handset, but the life cycles are just so long and the margins are so good, no particular socket has a great deal of competition when you designed it in, there\u2019s no incentive to design you out of product life-cycle, so that\u2019s the way these analog franchises grow revenue, is that you add new markets and new customers with very little concentration either on the customer side or on the product side.  That\u2019s exactly what our linear products business looks like today. I hope that is helpful.\nOperator\nAnd our next question is from Stephen Ferranti with Stephens, Inc.\nStephen Ferranti\nHey guys, this is Neil for Steve. Gross margins were impressive in the quarter.  How would you weight the impact of factors driving improvement in gross margins for the quarter?\nDonald Palette\nThe primary driver, as we said, has really been our ability to continue to execute operationally.  We\u2019ve got a pretty nice progression four quarters in a row of margin improvement and if you step back and look at it, it\u2019s really been our ability to continue to focus on improving yields, focus on driving \u2013 we typically drive about double digit material cost reductions year over year, that\u2019s continued to go very well.  And we continue to focus on our efficiencies in our factories, all those things are continuing to pay dividends. That\u2019s really, that drew the lion share of the increase in the quarter, the focus in that area. Now we also get into a nice benefit, Dave\u2019s comments talked about that, the hybrid manufacturing model, and one of the things that provides us flexibility, that provides us upside ability to ramp with having those partners on the outside, but what it really also does is it keep our factory utilization very, very high.  And that\u2019s another way for us to continue to drive margin improvement in the company.  So, it\u2019s really operational execution.  That\u2019s what drove it.\nStephen Ferranti with Stephens, Inc.\nOk, there\u2019s one more quick follow-up.  You guys talked a little bit about the transition into the six-inch Wafer, can you talk about how we can expect that transition to impact profitability going forward?  \nDavid Aldrich\nWe are well on the way, the transition will be completed sometime in 2009.  We have in fact, you\u2019ll notice that Don talked about the $126 Million of cash flow from operations and increasing net cash in the last few quarters, we\u2019ve been doing that while paying for the six inch Wafer equipment, so much of that is in and is being installed as we speak.  So the extent that it has a margin impact, it is having a margin impact now.  And that would be as measured by the need to create room for space and the cost associated with beginning to ramp those processes.  So we\u2019ve factored that into our model and so I don\u2019t think you will see  a reduction in gross margin driven by the six inch. Now when we come out of the other in of six inch we will have lowered our die costs by a little bit over 20%.  And we\u2019ll get a step functional capacity and with that hybrid model that means we will be able to pull in volumes so that we can increase our utilization in line with that increase in capacity while at the same time keeping our foundry partners healthy, so that\u2019s the goal.  You are seeing the impact now, and you\u2019ll see the benefit in mid 2009 or so.\nOperator\nOur next question is from James Faucette with Pacific Crest.\nJames Faucette- Pacific Crest\nThanks very much. I just wanted to go back to your 10% customers as a group etc.  Obviously there has been a little bit of movement there particularly since Samsung is coming in now as a 10% customer.  How should we think about the opportunities over the course of the rest of this year into 2009?  Do you think we will see new names among those 10% customer lists, or some movement there, or I guess I am trying to get a feel for your opportunities for new customers to be significant contributors?\nDavid Aldrich\nYeah James, that is a great question.  Let me start by saying we absolutely expect to add 10% names to the list.  If you look at our internal view we believe that by the end of the calendar year we should have at least four of the top five OEMs in the 10% counts for Skyworks.  Obviously growth is continuing with each and every one of those accounts.  We are focused on those.  The three that Don mentioned are very important and there are several new ones that we expect to be adding to that list. \nOperator\nOur next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Lehman.\nJeff Kvaal- Lehman Brothers\nThanks very much guys.  I was wondering if you would comment a little bit about the balance sheet?  In particular, I would like to ask about inventories, which are off a little bit this quarter?\nDonald Palette\nSure Jeff, this is Don.  We in our internal forecasts we fully anticipate an inventory build, and it was really based on customer demands for product going into the third quarter, so nothing unusual about it but us ramping opportunities externally. \nDavid Aldrich\nAnd I think as Don pointed out in his guidance we guided for June but we are seeing evidence of visibility for an accelerating growth prospect as we move throughout 2008 as these new customers come on line and some of these new analog products ramp into production.  So we are just getting prepared for that. \nJeff Kvaal- Lehman Brothers\nOk, so should we expect for the inventories to come down again in the June quarter, or in the September quarter?\nDonald Palette\nI would model it relatively flat.  I wouldn\u2019t expect a reduction. We are now going into a different revenue profile.  \nJeff Kvaal- Lehman Brothers\nOk, so I would expect inventories to be up, but inventory days should stay at this new level?\nDonald Palette\nOh yes, we are managing to the same turn number.  That\u2019s our job to make sure the turns don\u2019t drop.  \nJeff Kvaal- Lehman Brothers\nOk, so inventory turns targeted around six times?\nDonald Palette\nThat\u2019s our internal target.  \nJeff Kvaal- Lehman Brothers\nOk. Fantastic. And then, also Dave you talked a little bit about a choppy environment, I was wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind spending a little bit more time talking about that?\nDavid Aldrich\nSure, we have seen some share-shifts on our customer base, and when we see that, that creates some choppiness.  I think that hopefully you are getting the sense that as we increase our penetration across a broader set of customers we are beginning to see pushes and pulls or ups and downs with different customers and I think that our goal is to be as diversified a proxy for wireless handset for that segment of our business as we can.  That still means we\u2019ll see choppiness as OEM share shifts.  That\u2019s what we mean. We also saw more Edge and 2G product than we expected and a little less of 3G product than we expected, although the visibility is that that is an altered materially over the next several quarters.  But that is some of the choppiness to which we were referring. \nOperator\nOur next question is from [Jeroen Bas]  from UBS.\nJeroen Bos- UBS\nI just wanted to get more information on the previously answered question.  Can you quantify the compilation of ,  Is it more towards analog, or more towards handset.\nDonald Palette\nIt\u2019s more towards handset.\nJeroen Bos- UBS\nOk thanks.  And previously you talked about improvement on your 2G Forex?  Just wondering where that it and when do you expect to get to 90+%?\nDavid Aldrich\nWe\u2019ve been running in our 2G products, the yields are very high, into the nineties, and the 3G products depending on where they are in the ramp.  We typically see a learning curve where at early introduction we really hit the center of the design we may launch in the seventies, if not we may launch in the sixties.  But we quickly move into the eighties and then through test work and optimization of the design we are able to move it into the nineties and ultimately well into the nineties.  So we\u2019ve been pretty predictable I would say in 3G we are firmly in the eighties and in some products we are in the nineties.\nJeroen Bos- UBS\nThank you.\nOperator\n Our next question is from Nator Swansberg with Thomas Weisel.\nNator Swansberg- Thomas Weisel Partners\nFor the first question, you talked about some lumpiness due to your end customers and market share shift.  How does that relate to your reference partners?  Are you seeing some lumpiness there as well, or is that still quite stable?\nDavid Aldrich\nWell, with regard to  the reference partners those are engagements that are done at kind of a high level, long term relationship and those designs get ported out to multiple OEMs.  So I think that from a reference partnership viewpoint things have never looked better for Skyworks.  We are doing quite well with TI, QUALCOMM, and MediaTek.  We have mentioned before and there are several others that we are working on, so I don\u2019t think the order flow within a given quarter really has much to do with the reference partners.  Those are long term engagements. They have never looked brighter and we continue to be a valuable part of their overall solution.  \nNator Swansberg- Thomas Weisel Partners\nAnd then on the analog business you mentioned some of the new areas that you are penetrating, but if we look at that business that\u2019s a quarters revenues today what are some of the bigger components of that where we stand today?\nDavid Aldrich\nIt\u2019s actually becoming more and more diversified every quarter.  We do have a core base business in wireless infrastructure.  We started adding new markets such as automotive in the last several quarters, and automotive was a meaningful part of our business this last quarter.  We started working on engagements with companies that do energy management or meter reading systems.  We started working on medical.  So it\u2019s a number of new markets that are becoming quite diversified and not any one segment represents more than 20% of the overall portfolio.  \nOperator\nOur next question is from Mark Kellar with Merril Lynch\nMark Kellar- Merril Lynch\nHi, good afternoon guys.  I was wondering if you could give me your current mix between in sourced and outsourced manufacturing and what the utilization rate is currently.\nDavid Aldrich\nRoughly 80/20 in our foundries.  In our assembly it is perhaps a little bit less than 20% is out-sourced and our utilization is running in the eighties in PHEMP.  In HBT it is fluctuating a little bit.  It is impacted by the six inch conversion that we have been talking about.  We like to run in the 90% range as long as we\u2019ve got a fully qualified copy-exact partner for those processes.  That is our goal.  We are not there in PHEMPT, we are closer than that in HBT.  And we are there in assembly and testing.  \nMark Kellar- Merril Lynch\nAnd any change to your tax rate at this point?  Still running in the 2-3% range on a non-GAAP basis?  Any change to that going forward?\nDonald Palette\nWe talked a little more in detail about this in the last call.  With the tax valuation allowance in the books the rules require us to look at every quarter.  There is no change at this point and time. We are going to continue to look at that.  WE have about $185 Million of NOLs on the books, so for modeling purposes this year and next year we continue to use about 3% cash tax rate. \nOperator\nOur next question is from Craig Ellis with Citi\nCraig Ellis- Citi\nJust a couple of questions as far as the pricing environment.  First of all can you talk a little bit about the pricing trend in the March quarter?  And your expectations going forward in the June quarter relative to the norm?\nDavid Aldrich\nWith respect to pricing it really is a difficult question to answer.  The portfolio has so many components and there\u2019s blended ASPs.  But basically we are seeing the pricing environment stabilizing a little bit here as we exited March and we entered into the back half of the year, and for Skyworks specifically we have a few unique advantages in bringing in some of our technology such as PHEMPT and BAW Filter to create a blended solution that is quite differentiated and offers very high value to the customer.  I think that it is the increase in value that is doing the most for us in terms of stabilizing pricing.\nCraig Ellis- Citi\nOk, so just to follow up on that, given the diversification programs you have talked about in your prepared remarks, and also your comment on the Asian market, could you give us a sense of your pricing outlook for calendar 2008 relative to 2007 which I believe was down in the single digits?  \nDavid Aldrich\nThis is a handset centered question versus linear products, I take it?\nCraig Ellis- Citi\nLet\u2019s start with handset.\nDavid Aldrich\nOk, let me try and give you a little bit of color.  Before the move to some of the low-end phones that began to adopt the front end module technology the ASP erosion had been about 15% a year.  I would say that was the case in 2005and 2006.  The shift began to occur in 2007, thus in 2007 you saw single digit, in some cases low single digit ASP erosion.  It was a combination of the front end modules just declined less.  That blended with some of the older designs in 2G.  As we are going through 2008 and 2009, the actual ASPs are quite healthy in these new multi-mode designs and they are stabilizing on the low end by virtue of these more complicated PHEMS.  So I think the blended ASP for us on product-to-product basis again will be in the single digits, if you look at it product to product, it will be in the single digits, perhaps the mid-single digits.  But at the end of the day we are actually seeing an increase in our overall average ASP as we shift more PHEMs, more linear products and less of the older simplified 2G solutions.  So that\u2019s what we mean by a more stable pricing environment.\nOperator\nAnd our final question will be a follow up from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron- Oppenheimer\nJust a little bit more focus on cash.  Don, can you talk a little bit about your CapEx plan for the year?  And Dave, you are starting to have a different problem of lots of cash, has the thought of a buy-back ever crossed your mind?  Or how close are we to doing an M&A deal that expands your linear business?\nDonald Palette\nAs you know we spend almost $20 million in Q1 in capital, $17.5 this quarter.  We would expect capital spending to be roughly in line, maybe down a little bit, to what you just saw in Q2 and Q3.  And then a little bit of a drop into Q4.  So remember we are continuing to invest in six inch, we are investing in.. the CapEx that we invest in assembly and testing in Mexicali because you have square footage available pays for itself in a relatively short period of time and it\u2019s a real nice lever to continue to margin improvements.  So hopefully that gives you a view of CapEx.  And you\u2019re right, what we\u2019re really doing a good job of here is the improved business model effectively converting that to cash.  And you are right the balance sheet\u2019s getting a lot stronger.  We believe our currency is significantly undervalued.  We are looking at a stock buy-back but we haven\u2019t committed to do that yet but it is something we are continuing to look at. And I think Dave wants to address the M&A question.\nDavid Aldrich\nI think the M&A, if you live long enough and you do enough deals you know just how perilous they can be.  So I must say that we would only even consider an M&A deal that was so overwhelmingly creating shareholder value and low risk that our hurdle is so high that we have nothing on the horizon, but clearly it is an option for us but we are really quite conservative on the M& A front.  \nIttai Kidron- Oppenheimer\nOk.  We\u2019ll take it as buy-back then. \nOperator\nThis concludes today\u2019s question and answer session.  I would like to turn return the call to Dave Aldrich for any additional closing comments. \nDavid Aldrich\nThank you so much for participating and on behalf of the entire Skyworks team, thank you and we look forward to updating you next quarter.\nCopyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(Operator Instructions) At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Tom Schiller, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Schiller, please go ahead.", "Thomas Schiller", "", "Thanks, operator. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 conference call.  Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Palette our Chief Financial Officer, and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing.", "Dave will begin today\u2019s call with a business overview followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions. ", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our Pro Forma non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we have used in the past.  Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "I will now turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter and fiscal year of 2008.", "David Aldrich", "", "Thank you, Tom and welcome everybody.  I am pleased to report today that Skyworks delivered 22% revenue growth and a 59% operating income improvement in our fourth fiscal quarter, with several new programs and with linear product ramps enabling us to more than offset the slowing economy.  I believe our performance and growth outlook in the current environment demonstrates significant progress on our primary strategic objective.  Namely we\u2019re continuing to diversify Skyworks, we\u2019re gaining market share, we\u2019re capitalizing on content growth, and we\u2019re executing operationally.", "Specifically during the quarter, we achieved record-levels across our key financial metrics.  We exceeded our top line guidance of $225 million with revenue of $233 million.  We expanded our gross margins to 40.8%, that\u2019s up 140 basis points year over-year, and incidentally our sixth consecutive quarter of improvement.  We achieved a 15.5% operating margin and we post a $0.21 of earning per share that\u2019s $0.01 cent better than our guidance and up $0.14 in a year ago period.  We generated $52 million of cash flow from operations and we retired $62 million of convertible debt.  Our fourth quarter performance closed out a solid 2008, a year in which we exceeded our guidance in each and every quarter.", "Now special note, we delivered revenue of $860 million that\u2019s up 16% versus 2007 and up 22% in the second half versus the comparable period reflecting the momentum in new market and with our new customers.  We\u2019ve improved our operating income by more than 50% year over year.  We produced $0.71 of earnings per share, now that\u2019s up $0.48 from $0.48 in fiscal of 2007 and $0.21 in fiscal 2006.  And finally, we generated $174 million of cash flow from operations.", "With regard our to our diversifications strategy, we continue to gain momentum with linear products portfolio.  This products leverage our catalog business, our intellectual property and worldwide distribution network by expanding into a broader set of end-markets.  With nearly 1,000 global customers and over 2500 analog SKUs we are bolstering our product pipeline and expanding our addressable markets with each and every new customer engagement.", "Few examples during the quarter, we won a multiyear multimillion dollar defense contract with Lockheed Martin to supply microwave components for radar applications, airborne aircraft carriers, and fighter jets.  We\u2019ve also ramped Pentose Cell Base Station solutions and Samsungs and others in support of Verizon, Sprint and Nextel deployments.  We\u2019ve increased shipments of our remote meter readings solutions at Itron senses and senses in others.  We\u2019ve launched a portfolio of voltage control oscillators or VCOs, frequency synthesizers and mixers targeting home area networks and industrial automation applications. ", "Finally, we extended our Cisco relationship with a suite of new wireless access point solutions. Now at the same time we\u2019re continuing to diversify within our handset business with increasing support of all five top Tier 1 handset OEMs as well two of the leading smart phone suppliers. We\u2019re also aligned with each and every base band supplier, and this has been a terrific source of diversification for us.", "Another source to diversification has been our growth in the high growth smart phone segment. Here, we\u2019ve been consistently doubling shipments over the past few years and we closed fiscal 2008 at roughly 40 million units. As our smart phone unit growth trajectory at two times the market growth rate highlights, we\u2019re clearly gaining market share. More broadly, our 22% year-over-year revenue performance coupled with continued growth in the December quarter underscores that we\u2019re beginning to demonstrably outperform our traditional markets, while also penetrating new applications. ", "And in fact the weakening industry backdrop is accelerating vendors\u2019 share consolidation as both our linear and cellular handset customers are increasingly awarding programs based on highly integrated, low cost architectures, innovative roadmaps, operational scale and balance sheet strength. Let me expand a bit on this point. Many of our customers today are increasingly focused on designing highly complex multi-mode platforms. ", "Now these product offerings present multi-band switching, filtering, digital control and amplifications challenges to our customers. These are system level requirements which intersect with what we at Skyworks do quite well, and have proven to be elusive to our traditional competitor base. Speaking further on these multi-mode trends, we\u2019re also capitalizing on the three times increase, the 3x increase in handset FEM or front-end module content.", "The migration to higher end 3G and smart phone devices is happening albeit slower than market expectations, given the current economy. Nevertheless this macro trend is being fueled by carriers who see the value in data, in data services, in multi-media and web browsing. Now positive user experience is simply impossible without high-performance devices which seamlessly manage voice and data hand offs and roaming in multiple modes and bands. This trend expands our addressable market by literally billions of dollars from roughly $2 per phone in 2G to $6 when in 3G multi-mode, as we\u2019re uniquely able to sweep in switching, logic, filtering and wireless local area network functionality. So in short, market share gains along with this higher dollar content multi-mode content trend are having a compounding effect on the top line of our business. This trend is enabling us to continue to grow even under the most pessimistic handset forecast scenarios.", "And finally, we\u2019re executing operationally. As increasingly reflected in our results, at Skyworks, we\u2019re an extremely metrics driven company with an intense focus on continuous improvement in our yields, in our equipment utilization, in our cycle time and return on invested capital. This focus is beginning to show through with six consecutive quarters of gross margin expansion and improving cash flow. Importantly we now see a path to a 20% operating margin model beyond the $1 billion annualized revenue run rate.", "Okay, in summary, while we fully recognize the slowing global economy, Skyworks\u2019 financial position and growth outlook continues to improve, driven simply by diversification, by content growth and by operational execution. And while we certainly feel the impact of the market downturn, we\u2019re fortunate that we have several product investment areas that are just now beginning to ramp, allowing us to demonstrate sequential improvements. And just to be very clear, we are not wasting any time celebrating our 2008 results instead we enter fiscal 2009 intensely focused on making continuous progress towards realizing our vision of becoming the world leader in analog mobile connectivity semiconductor solutions, and in the process creating shareholder value.", "Okay, I\u2019ll now turn this over to Don for his review.", "Donald Palette", "Thanks Dave. Good evening everyone and thanks for joining us tonight. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was 232.6 million, up 22% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. Gross profit for the quarter was 94.9 million or 40.8% of revenue driven by higher equipment efficiencies in all of our factories, progress on yield improvement initiatives and double-digit year-over-year material cost reductions.", "Operating expenses were 58.9 million of which R&D expenses totaled 36.3 million and SG&A cost were 22.6 million. As a result, our operating income for the quarter was 36 million, up 59 % year-over-year and representing a 15.5% operating margin. Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was 700,000 while taxes were 100,000. Net income was 35.3 million, translating into $0.21 of earnings per share, $0.01 ahead of guidance.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 231 million. During the quarter, we recorded 11 million of depreciation generated $52 million in cash flow from operations, invested $13 million in capital expenditures and retired $62 million in convertible debt. ", "The recent volatility in the financial markets presented us the opportunity to retire one-half of our debt at a significant discount from previous trading levels. Specifically, $50 million was for debt coming due in 2010 while $12 million was used to retired 2012 notes. Further, post the quarter we have retired an additional $38 million of the 2012 notes which will be reflected in our December quarter balance sheet. ", "With the retirement of one-half of our convertible debt, we have effectively eliminated approximately 10.5 million shares that could have been convertible above $9.52 per share price while maintaining our positive net cash position. Given our strong growth outlook, these transactions serve the dough (ph 00:18:08) benefit of de-levering our balance sheet and allowing us to maintain our positive net cash profile while effectively eliminating a significant portion of the diluted impact of the convertible debt.", "Now to our business outlook for the first fiscal quarter of 2009.  As Dave outlined, customer and market diversification along with strong execution are enabling us to continue to grow our top and bottom lines even in the face of the broader industry downturn.  Specifically, we are forecasting December quarter revenue to be $240 million based on our strong backlog position. Operationally, we planned to further expand gross margin to the 41% to 41.5% range with operating expenses of $59 million driving an operating margin approaching 17%. ", "Below the line, we suggest modeling approximately $600,000 in net interest and other expense and taxes at a 3.5% to 4% cash tax rate. In turn, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share at $0.23 of a base of $166.5 million shares.", "We believe our guidance in corporate\u2019s current market uncertainty and at the same time reflects our ability to outperform our addressable markets. It is worth noting that during the fourth quarter based on the strength of our 2008 financial performance and our earnings outlook, we reversed approximately 34 million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance in our GAAP income statement. There was no benefit to our non-GAAP results and this accounting reversal has no impact on our 3.5% to 4% projected cash tax rate to fiscal 2009. ", "Looking beyond the current fiscal year, we have tax initiatives underway that when implemented and combined with the use of remaining R&D tax credits will equate to an estimated 2010 cash tax rate of approximately 15% to 18%. We\u2019re providing this key cash tax rate range a year advance to several investors who have expressed concern over the possibility of a 30% plus cash tax rate beginning in 2010.

Can you talk a little bit about new customers versus the end market?

This is Dave. Obviously, we are seeing a broad based slowdown in the market and it\u2019s particularly true in 3G and in some of our broad linear market statements. Fortunately at the same time, we are shipping some recently introduced products and we are ramping some new customer programs and just to be a little bit more general, our customers Cody, have increasingly been much more selective. For example, we\u2019re ramping in production with customers who experienced some supply chain disruptions a year ago, so we are in fact, seemed to share gains for being awarded, I think that business. Now we enter 2009 because we stepped up, we are able to deliver. Also our customers are really in this multi-mode environments struggling with somebody\u2019s new highly-complex designs, so increasingly we\u2019re getting higher dollar content platforms, many of them ramping now and into 2009. That instead of being a PA, we would have some pretty complex logic amplification switching and filtering. So the combination of those things are allowing us to offset what is clearly some broad-based softness.", "Cody Acree \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Let me take it one step further, these market share gains, I would expect to extend on and through the first half, do you have enough visibility from some new customers that are coming in that help to offset some of typical seasonality through Q1/Q2?", "David Aldrich", "", "Well, are you starting (ph 00:22:55) at March quarter, Cody?", "Cody Acree \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Yes. No, sorry, seasonal Q1/ Q2?", "David Aldrich", "", "Right. Well, yes, we are. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we are ramping this new programs, we have introduced some new products in our linear products catalog. Those are being received pretty well.  It\u2019s awfully (ph 00:23:10) early to talk about March. In fact, we do expect there to be a fairly significant decline in March, perhaps worse than we\u2019ve seen in prior years. But nonetheless, we do have programs moving in the production, as you asked and we\u2019re entering a growth phase with some new markets.  And we\u2019ve talked in the past about energy management, we\u2019re now ramping some energy management products, wireless meter readers and the like. We also have some military microwave programs that are just better going into production, so it\u2019s the combination of those kinds of new market and applications that allow us we believe to outperform the March seasonality which will certainly be there.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Sanjay Devgan with Morgan Stanley.", "Sanjay Devgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hey guys, thanks so much for taking my call and congratulations on the great quarter. Looking at your guidance for next quarter, I mean giving the macro issues and you guys are obviously very different from a lot of other companies that have reported. I was wondering if you can give us a sense of the amount of conservatives that we\u2019ve taken into a guidance, i.e. relative to past quarters when you\u2019ve guided, is your backlog coverage higher than previous, the same or how should we kind of view that?", "David Aldrich", "", "Well, we have absolutely tempered what would have been our growth expectation under normal circumstances. So, one of the advantages we have is we are shipping to all the top Handset OEMs, we\u2019re partnered with all the top baseband OEMs and we\u2019re shipping into the top Smartphone manufacturers.

That being said, clearly the market is sought. But we do have some programs with pretty high ASPs that are ramping. We have terrific visibility into those, as we always do when a new program ramp and we are getting very good performance out of our sort of a broad-based catalogue business.

Yeah with respect to linear, we cover a diverse set of markets.

We are seeing particular strength with Wa Wei (ph 00:28:05) and BT as they ramp GS Sound (ph 00:28:07) and start moving in higher end systems. We also see WCDMA infrastructure starting to pick up going into 2009. So we see that segment as one of the elements for linear.

So segments like energy management, we supply customized solutions that bring wireless technology from the meter to the utility and we\u2019ve even moved inside of the hallway from Zigby products to do home automation and those markets are very new for Skyworks.

We\u2019ve gained tremendous share in this  smart phone space and I think from my seat here, I think one of the drivers to our story has been share gains and we\u2019ve been able to accomplish that. In this market, we\u2019ll accomplish it in 2009.", "[Unidentified Executive]", "", "Please keep in mind, just to augment that and say what\u2019s really happening is at the level of complexity required to deliver these new solutions and that\u2019s also true incidentally on the low end where it\u2019s more front end logical, less single function amplifiers and clearly on the mid to high end with multibands and challenges with shielding, filtering as well as typically amplification. What our customers are looking for is to engage early with a solution so the competitive base, if you\u2019ve been in this market a while, 3 years ago we were competing with 12 to 13 companies, a couple of years ago it was 6 or 7. ", "Today when we go into an engagement, it\u2019s very early in the phone design and we\u2019re competing with another company. When we win it, it\u2019s typically sole source for that platform. At most, there\u2019s two. So it\u2019s just a very different dynamic.

Just wondering if you could perhaps take us through, I know the visibility\u2019s real tough right now but your expectations for the linear group as we get, I know you said for next quarter, should be up but into next year, I think before you kind of expected each quarter to go sequentially up a little bit, can you talk a little bit about that, how you see that market progressing in 2009? Thanks.", "[Unidentified Executive]", "", "Well maybe Liam and I will take this together. The play for us in linear products, remember we generated this organic growth engine for the company about 3 years ago. We\u2019ve doubled down on R&D over that period of time. Now we\u2019ve got a nice steady state, team of developers and applications, and marketing people leveraging the distribution of rep sales channel that we have. It\u2019s quite specialized and each quarter, we\u2019re putting many new products into a catalogue. The name of the game here is you characterize from across as many operating  frequencies, voltages. You\u2019re trying to get as many hits on a given platform as is possible and to keep them as general purpose as is possible,", "So part of it has to do with the nascent nature of our business. We are growing sequentially as we\u2019re adding new markets that are being facilitated by a whole host of new products. Having said that, it\u2019s not immune from a market slowdown but we do have the benefit of each and every quarter, we are ramping new stuff in addition to exploiting the older installed base.

We\u2019re entering new markets with relatively, today, low penetration and growing into those market segments.", "Mike Burden \u2013 Think Equity", "", "Okay and then over on the wireless side, could you give us a sense of how big the Chinese white box market is for you guys and what you see developing within China?", "Liam Griffin", "", "Yeah, well I mean we\u2019re not going to specifically comment on the white box market. That\u2019s difficult to ascertain but certainly China is a very big part of the story in wireless for Skyworks and for everyone in our industry and it is also a market that has quite a bit of volatility. We understand that but a couple things and we consider China to be a very strategic part of our story. We\u2019ve gained a lot of market share. We commented earlier on supply chain disruption. There were customers in that market that were hit with shortages. We stepped up. We gained a lot of market share and we\u2019re going to keep that. ", "We\u2019ve also done a great job on the infrastructure side. So it does become a big part of our story but I will say that when we move into this quarter and even looking into 2009, we have taken a very cautious view on China.

Great job guys.  Can you give us any sort of sense for some of the newer OEMs that you\u2019re gaining share with?

Steve well on the handset side, we know who the players are. So in many cases, it\u2019s deeper penetration into accounts that we may have had a small share in right? We\u2019ve got a very large tier 1 that we\u2019re, I would say, we\u2019re maybe in the 3rd inning of the game with that account and we have a long way to go.", "Some of our Korean customers have been very strong for us in this later year, we\u2019ve gained a lot of share but I will say that there\u2019s quite a bit of upsides specifically in WCDMA and we\u2019ve done very well in the smart phone space and I think that\u2019s a space we really have to watch in this market. We alluded to the benefit that carriers are seeing with data services and an increase in (inaudible 00:34:02). What that\u2019s doing in the smart phone space is driving complexity and requirements higher and providing us an opportunity to add more value.

Some real interesting diversified markets in new customers on LP. So collectively, all that brings a great deal of diversity to the business.", "[Unidentified Executive]", "", "And let me just add that the largest OEM, they\u2019re not a 10% customer today.

We\u2019re seeing customers now that want band 1-8 in Europe, 2 and 5 for Americas and often putting those all in one phone.

Congratulations on the quarter. So on the shared gains, I just want to press a little more here.

We\u2019re just really the tip of the iceberg in some of those opportunities. I think it\u2019s a general, so the answer is no.

The differential is in the level of complexity. Here\u2019s what happened. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening Todd. In the not-too-distant past, companies were buying multiple single bands of Y band and CDMA in the case of wedge with maybe an edge quad band PA, a separate filter, a switch, a whole bunch of discreets and as an example in wedge, where that has moved towards is a typical offering for us. ", "We\u2019ll have us in a single package as much as a 9 or 10 throw switch meaning it\u2019s covering all the functionality of the various bands and transmit and receive and mode switching, it\u2019ll have some content of filtering, have some pretty sophisticated logic to essentially provide a traffic flow, if you will, for all those frequencies. A lot of issues around shielding at ESD and then clearly very linear amplifiers that are combining bands so that they\u2019re not only, they\u2019re operating very efficiently for battery voltage standpoint while doing simultaneous voice and data.", "And so those produces are really hard to design. It\u2019s taken us literally thousands of man years, years to do this. They\u2019re really hard to design. They get designed in early because it\u2019 has such a big implication on the overall system performance that it\u2019s not your grandfather\u2019s PA and that\u2019s the difference. So it is our ability to design a product that while we\u2019re not the only people who could address it clearly far, far fewer.

I just don\u2019t know how you compete across a broad spectrum. You have to be very selective. We don\u2019t want to be very selective. We want to be very broad and very diversified. So I think organically, we can do a terrific job of being a consolidator of market share by focusing on what we\u2019re doing today.", "Suji De Silva \u2013 Kaufman Brothers, L.P.

Most of my questions were asked. However, if you could comment on where you think content per multi-mode phone, actually in 2009 is, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on how many bands also.  ", "[Unidentified Executive]", "", "Sure. Sure. Yeah. Well as we move out into 2009, you\u2019re already seeing the evidence of some very innovative 3G models that are clearly not voice only. You\u2019re seeing the smart phone. So we see content moving now, traditional 3G phones, if we had 2 or 3 bands basically anchored by an (inaudible 00:48:28) content, maybe about $3 to $4. ", "We see that moving now $5 to $6 into 2009 and again, we go back to where the carriers are making money with data service. They are driving higher requirements and more complexity in the handset. Our handset customers are willing to pay a little bit more for performance. Carriers will pay a little more for that handset. They\u2019ll get a payback in 30 days on (inaudible 00:48:50). So the whole food chain is working well for us in that domain.", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig\u2013Hallum Capital Group", "", "Okay. Any change in 10% customers in the quarter and what are your expectations for December? I know you\u2019re expecting 4 to 5 top by the end of December to be 10%.", "[Unidentified Executive]", "", "There was no change. We had Sony, Eriksson, and Samsung were top 10% in the 4th quarter consistent with the 3rd quarter. We still have a shot at having 4 of our OEM customers in the top 10%. If they are not in the top 10%, just based on the things roll out, they\u2019re going to be in high, significant digits. So that\u2019s still something we\u2019re trying to drive home. We\u2019ll see how it works out.", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig\u2013Hallum Capital Group", "", "Okay. One final question for you. On your 6-inch transition, maybe a little bit more color on how that scaling also what can uptake and gross margins, you think, do you might see in the second half of \u201809 as a result?", "[Unidentified Executive]", "", "Well it\u2019s late \u201809 into 2010\u2026", "[Unidentified Executive]", "Minimal impact in \u201809, minimal.", "[Unidentified Executive]", "", "And I\u2019ve got to tell you I think that\u2019s up in Newbury Park, California by the way and I think the team is just doing outstanding. I mean they\u2019re continuing to operate with their day jobs. They\u2019re executing the process qualification. We are absolutely on track. We have an advantage because we have a partner in HBT that we can ramp outside of Skyworks. We\u2019re able to ramp and create buffers of capacity so that we could actually do sort of an in-line transition, machine-by-machine, process step by process step. You won\u2019t see any disruption for that. I\u2019m very confident from that, I\u2019m very confident the team. It\u2019ll be late in \u201909 and I got, my hat\u2019s off to the groups.

Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Palette, our Chief Financial Officer, and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing.  Dave will begin today\u2019s call with a business overview followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook.  We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.  I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we have used in the past.  Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.  ", "With that said, I will now turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "", "Dave Aldrich", "Welcome everyone!  Despite ongoing market weakness, Skyworks delivered solid financial performance in our first fiscal quarter of \u201909.  Most notably, our revenue of $210 million was in line with one year ago, $0.17 of earnings per share was $0.02 better than consensus.  We generated $75 million of cash flow from operations.  As a result, we ended the quarter with $250 million in cash, and on today\u2019s call, we will discuss what we believe is differentiating Skyworks in this challenging market and the steps we\u2019ve taken to improve our competitive position towards emerging an even more stronger and an even more profitable company when the markets recover.  ", "First and foremost, throughout all of Skyworks, we are intensely focused on executing to our strategic initiatives which we\u2019ve outlined in several previously calls, namely market diversification, share gains, and operational execution.  In particular, we believe our financial performance is beginning to demonstrate the success of our fab-lite manufacturing strategy and diversification initiatives that we commenced several years ago, and by fab-lite what I mean to imply is that our hybrid manufacturing model where we partnered with existing foundry suppliers, and we\u2019ve created a copy exact replica of our capabilities including our quality systems and our tool sets, and as a result, we are now much better able to balance external capacity with the demands of the marketplace.  ", "Internally, our utilization remains high, and we are therefore able to maintain margins and maintain return on invested capital over a much broader range of revenues.  Now, this model is quite unique in the handset market though it\u2019s much more common in the precision analog markets.  At the same time, we are driving continuous improvements in our yields, in our equipment utilization, and in our cycle times.  Together, our fab-lite model and our operational focus have resulted in higher gross and operating margins and generated strong cash flow.  ", "On the diversification front, we are gaining share in a variety of exciting growth applications, and one example is during the quarter we ramped energy management semiconductors in support of Itron, Sensus, and Landis and Gear which translated into a more than 30% sequential growth in this sector.  This is proving to be the start of what we believe to be a macro transition to smart grid wireless technology with Skyworks at the forefront of the market\u2019s development.  ", "Additionally, we are ramping our recently introduced suite of silicone based voltage control oscillators or VCOs and frequency synthesizers.  These devices play a critical role in the signal generation and timing performance of our customers\u2019 architectures.  These products we believe showcase the breadth of our analog silicone design initiatives where we are aiming at a number of high margin products in underserved end-markets.  ", " ", "Across these and other program ramps, we are leveraging core analog and mix signal technologies into emerging applications.  These applications are defined by much longer product lifecycles, higher margin profiles, and these margin profiles are commensurate with the value of our technical innovation.  In other words, our customers are quite willing to pay for performance in these markets.", "Now that said, we are in no way immune from this unprecedented economic downturn.  Consumer confidence levels are approaching all-time lows, and it\u2019s really unclear just when we\u2019ll see a market recovery.  Nonetheless, we\u2019re not waiting for perfect information, and we\u2019ve taken steps to align our cost structure with the economic realities.  At Skyworks, we\u2019re really quite fortunate that we\u2019re not opportunity constrained, and therefore we\u2019re able to approach our cost reductions in a much more strategic way.  ", "Specifically, we\u2019ve undertaken a very rigorous portfolio management approach, the result of which is that we have ceased our development of low margin 3.5G and 4G cellular transceivers, and we\u2019ve increased our R&D investment in higher growth, higher margin adjacent analog markets.  Actions which beginning this quarter will net-net improve our operating income by more than $20 million annually and I think much more importantly will yield higher future returns.", "Leveraging our analog and our mixed signal integration competencies, we\u2019ve enhanced focus within our linear products business by creating two dedicated development and marketing teams at a much lower R&D burn rate.  These activities are directed at custom vertical markets or adjacent markets and standard analog component applications, complementing our leadership front-end solutions franchise.", "Before turning this over to Don, let me close by saying that we are creating we believe a uniquely diversified company with the scale derived from volume wireless applications applied to a range of analog product markets and applications.", "Don Palette", "Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $210.2 million versus $210.5 million in the year ago period and representing a 9.6% sequential decrease.  Gross profit was $84.8 million or 40.3% of revenue, a 50 basis point expansion year over year.  Our ability to maintain gross margins in the 40% range is being driven by the flexibility of our fab-lite model, improved equipment efficiencies at all of our factories, progress on yield improvement initiatives, double digit year-over-year material cost reductions, and the continued migration to a richer product mix.  ", "Operating expenses were $56.2 million, of which R &D expenses totaled $33 million and SG&A costs were $23.2 million.  As a result, our operating income for the quarter was $28.6 million, equal to our operating income in the first fiscal quarter of 2008 and representing a 13.6% operating margin.  ", "Our net interest and other income for the quarter was $263,000.00, while taxes were $1.2 million.  As a result, net income was $27.6 million, or $0.17 of earnings per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $250 million.  During the quarter, we generated $75 million in cash flow from operations.  We recorded $11 million in depreciation, invested $13 million in capital expenditures, and retired $41 million in convertible debt for $0.93 on the dollar.  Our strong cash flow position and continued volatility in the financial markets, presented us with the opportunity to retire an additional $41 million of our 2012 convertible debt.  With the retirement of over half of our convertible debt, we have effectively reduced potential future dilution by 11 million shares. ", "Perhaps more importantly, over the past year, we have increased our cash balance from $207 million at the end of Q1 fiscal 2008 to $250 million most recently, while simultaneously reducing our convertible debt from $200 million last year to $97 million today.  Balance sheet strength is increasingly a key determining factor in winning business, particularly during this challenging economic time.  Customers and suppliers alike want to partner with companies who not only provide innovative solutions but with those who are financially well positioned to support their long-term roadmaps.  This is yet another area where we believe we are distinguishing ourselves. ", "   ", "Now, to our business outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2009.  First some market color.  We believe traditional market seasonality of 15% is being magnified by the ongoing inventory correction, creating a 20 to 30% sequential sell in market decline as OEMs and distributors reduce their inventory levels.  Against this backdrop, we are forecasting our revenue to decline 20% sequentially.  ", "Operationally, our fab-lite hybrid manufacturing strategy is enabling us to maintain gross margin in the 39-40% range.  Additionally, with the completion of our expense reduction initiatives, we are planning for operating expenses of $49 to $50 million of which $28 million is R&D.  Below the line, we anticipate $300,000 in net interest and other expense, and taxes at a 4% cash tax rate.  In turn, we expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.10 to $0.11 off of a base of 166 million shares.  ", "At a higher level, our December quarter margin performance and cost reduction initiatives underscore the resiliency of our operating model in the phase of this market downturn.  Most importantly, as the market recovers, our path to sustainable 20% plus operating margins is now that much faster.  That concludes our prepared comments.  ", "Operator, let\u2019s open the lines now for questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions.)  Our first question will come from Cody Acree from Stifel Nicolaus.", "", "Cody Acree \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Could you talk a little bit about a couple of things \u2013 one, channel inventory help, obviously sell-in versus sell-out is going to be a little bit different this quarter, so there\u2019s still some burn, but channel or OEM inventory health, and then also what you\u2019re seeing from order linearity, cancellations, push-outs.  We\u2019ve seen some commentary during the quarter that maybe things have firmed up just a bit, maybe not yet improving but firmed and not continuing to decline.", "Dave Aldrich", "As we mentioned in our comments, we are seeing entering March what we consider to be a relatively normal seasonality if not a little worse, maybe 15%, but of course we\u2019ve been tracking very closely the inventory position, and we are seeing an inventory contraction or an inventory burn that\u2019s going on, so we think that the sell-in at the component or at the semiconductor level is perhaps 20 to 30% or so.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.  It\u2019s really no different than comments you\u2019ve heard elsewhere, but we\u2019re actually watching that inventory burn.  It began in December, and we\u2019re seeing it continue a bit into the March quarter.  ", "Don Palette", "With respect to your comments on order dynamics, certainly the end market is down and we\u2019ve factored that into our guidance, but having said that order patterns right now have actually been quite steady and consistent with our outlook.  We\u2019re seeing demand come through multiple channels, not just handsets, but also infrastructure, and backlog generation thus far has been quite steady.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.", "George Iwanyc \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Just following up on the order outlook, what percentage of your business is linear right now, and how do the orders trend there?  Are you seeing that become a bigger part of your overall business in the near term?", "Dave Aldrich", "What was really quite remarkable the November-December downturn was how broad based it was.  We track it by customer, we track it by market segment, or at least those market segments in which we participate, and we saw it was just universal.  There was this general trend or desire to exit the calendar year with as little inventory as possible.  It was clear that March was going to be seasonal and every bit as seasonal as prior years.  There was no incentive to get out in front of any inventory or capacity position, so I must say that it was no different really in general between our linear products business and our handset business or between customers or between regions.", "George Iwanyc \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Does that mean linear stayed around that 23% contribution area?", "Dave Aldrich", "Yes.", "George Iwanyc \u2013 Oppenheimer", "How do you see order patterns progressing right now?  Do you believe that at least from a Skyworks perspective that by the end of the quarter you will be back on track relative to channel inventory?", "Don Palette", "The inventory across the market space certainly varies sector to sector, but order patterns right now are consistent with our guidance.  We have taken a very conservative view of some of leading OEMs.  We\u2019ve also studied inventory in the channel that we can manage through our distribution partners, so to the extent that we would be impacted, we feel that we\u2019ve put the diligence in place for that.  Now, certainly there are some market dynamics out there.  Some customers have handsets in inventory, etc., but we believe we\u2019ve done a healthy job in managing that and understanding that as we got it.", "Dave Aldrich", "As you\u2019ll notice from the balance sheet, even though the demand signaled real falloff mid quarter or so or relatively late in the quarter, we were able to throttle back our suppliers from a capacity standpoint.  We think we have quite a short cycle time, so we were able to react to that, so our own component inventory in the sell-in to Skyworks is in pretty good shape.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Ferranti with Stevens.", "Stephen Ferranti \u2013 Stevens Inc.", "Do you believe that in the March quarter you will be running your production rates below the underlying demand level, or are we at a point where you are actually just sort of running in line with demand?", "Dave Aldrich", "We\u2019re running below, and let me make sure I understand the question.  I\u2019m quite sure that we\u2019re not at equilibrium in that the sell-through or the sell-out of the channel to consumers is higher than the sell-in at the component level because there is inventory of phones and there is inventory of components that are being burned, so that\u2019s what we see right now, and December was the same thing.  If you look at the sequential, September to December, handset sales, they were down, but they were down modest single digits.  If you look at the aggregate reduction, we were down around 9 and change, but the market was down anywhere between 20 to 30%.  That\u2019s the aggregate of all the suppliers who\u2019ve reported publicly.  That difference is purely inventory burn.  ", "Stephen Ferranti \u2013 Stevens Inc.", "So it sounds like we\u2019ll still have a bit of a burn here in the March quarter going on.", "Dave Aldrich", "That\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in our guidance, and that\u2019s correct.", "Stephen Ferranti \u2013 Stevens Inc.", "Can you give us some sense of what percentage of your business you are running in house versus outsourcing at this point?", "Don Palette", "Steve, it depends on the activity.  On assembly and test, it\u2019s virtually zero being outsourced, and on our wafers, it\u2019s approximately 20 to 25%.", "Dave Aldrich", "One of the things we were able to do in the seasonal down quarter is we throttled way back externally, and we maintained reasonable utilization at our factories, so that number isn\u2019t normally quite that low or quite that high, internal versus external, but that\u2019s what we were able to accomplish in the seasonally low quarter, and as you can see hopefully from the way we guided in the gross margin and operating income models, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing a big benefit from.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Koffman with Raymond James.", "Todd Koffman \u2013 Raymond James", "When you look at your December quarter performance relative to some of your larger competitors, your downturn in the December quarter was very modest relative to the pretty sharp declines some of your competitors saw.  The share gains that you saw, were they in both sides of your business in the cellular and the linear, or was there one side where you seemed to have done a better job relative to the competition?", "Dave Aldrich", "As we mentioned in an answer to an earlier question about how was the balance, it was pretty broad based.  If you look at our base business, if you will, we saw exactly what many of the competitors had seen, which is a pretty dramatic year-over-year and sequential decline, but we offset that by some program ramps with smart phones.  We had some analog component introductions where the takeup in the market has been pretty strong, and what we call adjacent markets where we are doing custom solutions and identified adjacent markets, we had a couple of those, like energy management for example that did well, and that offset a pretty tough base business.", "Todd Koffman \u2013 Raymond James", "You\u2019re getting out of the transceiver development business.  You called out a pretty sizable savings.  How much revenue today are you doing in transceivers?", "Don Palette", "Last year, we were roughly around $30 million, and in the first quarter, it\u2019s 1% of revenues.  It\u2019s a very insignificant amount of our revenue.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "First let me follow up on the comments on transceiver.  Can you just explain to what its strategic objective really is in terms of why you are continuing with its development?  Is this something that will eventually in the future contribute to a sizable revenue?  I know you are moving from 3.5G to 4G, but can you just help me understand what the strategy is?", "Dave Aldrich", "Let me try to make it clear.  We were partnered with a very large baseband supplier targeting a couple of OEMs.  That baseband supplier recently lost that business, and as a result the uptake that we might have seen in LTE and in some 3.5G, we think it\u2019s going to be less probable, and what we have been analyzing and the decision that we made entering this quarter was that there are non-cellular handset analog opportunities, VCO synthesizers is one, up covert and down covert functions, energy management, cellular infrastructure, other applications that use the very same silicon RF integration techniques, but those customers frankly pay a whole lot more.  They value the technology, and they pay for the performance of the cellular handset.  Customers typically don\u2019t today because it\u2019s becoming a solution bundled with a baseband or a modem offering more and more.  So it\u2019s more of a pure bulk volume CMOS play, so we have ceased development of 3.5G and 4G products, stopped, and we have applied a subset of those resources, in fact some extremely talented engineers and applications and systems people towards clearly identified vertical market opportunities that we knew if we apply those people that we had the customers lined up, and that we know that we could hit the ground running, and I think you\u2019re going to find long term that while we are in RF, we are in RF and non-handset markets, and the returns will be much higher.  ", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "", "In terms of understanding the gross margin dynamics, first of all can you talk to me about what happened so far with pricing and looking out into the future even as your shipments are below the sell-through?  Do you anticipate that there will be any impact to pricing and what is a level that we can bottom at?", "Dave Aldrich", "Maybe Liam and I will answer that question together.  It is the case today that unlike 2, 3, or 4 years ago that the vast majority of the designs that we produce are custom designs, designed for a customer with a specific baseband, implementation or baseband architecture, and a as a result, we are much more often than not sole source in a platform, not sole source within a customer but sole source platform, in a given platform, and that\u2019s much more often the case today than not, and in those cases, it\u2019s much more about are you able to deliver the customer\u2019s required system level performance, and are you able to sweep in the functionality that allows them to justify paying you a reasonable price for the component, if you will, with a solution, while at the same time achieving their bill of material objectives.  That\u2019s a big way of saying, maybe a long way of saying.   It\u2019s a win-win scenario we look to create by doing things like transmit front-end modules for multi-band, multi-mode handsets providing a price that\u2019s much lower than doing it with a more discrete implementation.  They get a lower BOM cost, a more reliable product, and we get higher ASP, and of course in the blended Skyworks sense as we are doing more multi-market linear product analog markets, our blended ASP is benefiting from that.", "Operator", "", "Next question comes from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum Capital.", "", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital", "", "Could you give us the number of 10% customers if there were any changes from last quarter?", "", "Don Palette", "", "The two 10% customers we had during the quarter were Samsung and Sony Ericsson.", "", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital", "", "What percentage of your business was 3G versus 2G?", "Don Palette", "Very similar, 55% 2G and 45% multimode and WEDGE.", "", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital", "", "Can you give us a sense of your CapEx plans for 2009?", "Don Palette", "For the first half of this year, when you look at our actual and our first quarter forecast, we are planning our CapEx investment to approximate our depreciation level of about $11 million a quarter.  For the second half of the year, while we don\u2019t give guidance, we\u2019re expecting that number to be below depreciation level in the second half based on what\u2019s going on in the economy.", "", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital", "", "You mentioned $20 million in annual cost cuts.  Are those complete or what can we expect perhaps in the June quarter in operating expnse side?", "", "Don Palette", "", "They were announced and completed in January.", "", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital", "", "Also you mentioned that your cycle times are better.  Can you quantify that a little bit more and how much further can you go?  Just wondering what other further gains we could see there.", "", "Don Palette", "", "Cycle time for our front-end products for example where there is not a lot of silicone or CMOS content, the cycle time for those is measured in weeks, perhaps 9 weeks or so.  We can make them shorter than that if we need to with lead lot or hot lot capabilities, but I would say the end to end is around 9 weeks, and if there is silicone content and we don\u2019t have a standing inventory level, it could be 16 weeks or so, but in this phase, really quite short.", "", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "I was just wondering in terms of the shape of gross margin, what you think some of the different puts and takes may be there and whether we should expect it to be broadly flattish from the current level or how you would expect that to trend?  I was also wondering given the restructuring that you are doing, what the headcount was at the end of the quarter, and how we should think about that going forward?", "", "Dave Aldrich", "", "Well, longer term, the business that we\u2019ve chosen not to participate in which was cellular transceivers in 3.5 and in LTE, those were just about the lowest gross margin products in the company.  There was a lot of revenue there, but that $30 million last year, that was about the lowest gross margin products in the company.  We are replacing it, we hope over time, with these targeted adjacent market linear solutions like VCO synthesizers.  They are about the highest gross margin products in the company, so that diversification play for is having a blended gross margin benefit.  Also as we increase revenue, of course, we get benefit in utilization from that, so we\u2019ve flexed the supply chain, improved our mix, and that\u2019s how we are maintaining we think pretty strong gross margin in the seasonally low quarter during an inventory burn, but as revenue increases, you should expect gross margin accretion and a lot of leverage at the operating expense line.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "On the headcount, could you also comment on that?", "", "Dave Aldrich", "", "The head count reduction was about 150.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "So what does that take you to?", "", "Dave Aldrich", "", "It takes us to about 3150, of which about 1600 of those are engaged in assembly and test in Mexico.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "With respect to your inventory on hand, how should we think about that trending going forward?", "Don Palette", "We were down about $5 million from the September quarter to the December quarter.  We would expect based on where we are at right now and the inventory build plans in place and the market demand that that number is going to be relatively flat at the end of March.  That\u2019s our expectation.", "", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Sanjay Devgan with Morgan Stanley.", "Sanjay Devgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Just a question on your plans regarding your conversion from the 4-inch to 6-inch wafers, how do you view that and how should we think about that in terms of your CapEx outlay?  I know you talked about CapEx being lower than it is in the first half of year, so does that mean those plans are slowing down, or how should we think about that?", "Don Palette", "Given what's been going on, we have definitely slowed down that investment.  It's still an investment.  It's a core part of our long-term margin growth strategy.  Right now our expectation is with the slight slow down in investment that we're going to go live with the 6-inch early next year in 2010, but during that interim period, we expect no margin erosion as a result of the push out, so those are our plans right now. ", " ", "Operator", " ", "The next question comes from Nathan Johnson with Pacific Crest. ", " ", "Nathan Johnson \u2013 Pacific Crest", " ", "You've talked in the past about the number of competing suppliers being significantly smaller when you going after the WCDMA platforms because of the technology difficulties with often only one other supplier at the table.  I was wondering if you guys expect that to change at all going forward or the other competitor beyond just that one beginning to catch up.  How much of a lead do you guys think that you have over the rest of the field?  Secondly, I was just wondering if you give us an update on your tax expectations for fiscal 2010 given the current market conditions and earnings expectations.  Does that ramp in taxes push out at all?", " ", "Dave Aldrich", " ", "Let me make a general comment that hopefully answers that question, and then Don can help on the latter part.  In general if you were to look at 2007, 2006, the transition began to happen in earnest more in 2008, you are looking at north of a billion units a year, most being dominated by 2G, very little high band count if you will multimode, and as a result, you would have seen power amplifier companies a few year ago, maybe as many as 12, 14 on the pure PA.   In 2007-2008, that began to transition to more of a transmit module, and the difference is that they are high complicated switch counts or throw count switches.  There\u2019s more filtering, there\u2019s more digital logic control to control all the frequency transmit received in band modes, essentially playing traffic cop, and because of all that complexity, a real hard time going through FTA and shielding all of that RF content, so when we compete with some of the newer reference designs with Qualcomm and others or when we go after our top-tier customers, these modules are pretty complicated, but the technology and process and the complexity of the packaging is high, so today we see typically in a customer application perhaps one other viable competitor.  It\u2019s not always the same competitor, but one other viable competitor, and I would say that rather than having a dozen companies going after a buck and a half of phone over a billion units, you now have 2 or 3 much more broad-based companies with scale who I think are going to have the lion\u2019s share of what\u2019s becoming a $3 billion or so market as the average content in smart phones, CDMA, and EDGE is quite a bit higher than 2G.  ", "Don Palette", "On the tax question followup, if you recall, in the last call, we were trying to put some color and highlights around where we expected our cash tax rate with our NOL position to be in 2010, and we may get some slight benefit from what\u2019s going on in the economy and some of the slowdown in the top line, but I think the safe takeaway here is to assume in 2010 we are going to be about 15% to 18% in the cash tax rate, and that\u2019s not dramatically different than what we have told you in the past.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equity Research", "", "It sounds like you\u2019ve gotten really good control of your utilization and your capacity, but your days of sales still went up this last quarter which is actually pretty typical for this space, the only company that has gone down seems to be Nokia, even in an absolute sense when inventories have gone down because the sales have slowed down.  You said you are under producing so that you got the room to burn off more inventory, but you are looking for flat on an absolute basis.  Should we expect to see days of sales decline before you maybe inch that capacity up and will that take a couple of quarters?  I\u2019m trying to figure out when does this chain tighten up so that you\u2019ll start seeing the whiplash on the upside of the rain because if Nokia or some of your larger customers start to tighten up and quits selling out of inventory, your orders are naturally going to go up even if handset demand doesn\u2019t increase, so I\u2019m trying to get a feel for where you are on that kind of curve.  ", "Liam Griffin", "Well, clearly this quarter, the signals were pretty late, and so I thought we reacted pretty well to maintain the turns that we did.  I think the inventory was slightly down, and we had a slight impact on the turns because of exactly what Dave described.  Those signals came in past October, and so it did have some impact.  To your point, we are expecting the overall gross inventory to be relatively flat going into March.  That\u2019s going to impact the turns slightly, but we are well positioned as we balance our production in the second half of year that we are going to drive those turns back up to prior levels.  That\u2019s our target.", "", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equity Research", "", "It affected your competitors and your customers much worse than it affected you, so it looks like you guys responded very well, and you are holding production load in order to keep the turns up.  When do you think you\u2019ll get to the point where your turns will either be back in line or maybe even a little bit lower than historic, so you start seeing utilizations go back up, and if that happens, will we see corresponding improvement in margins or are you running your internal factories pretty heavy now and just lighted up on your outsourcing?", "Dave Aldrich", "We will see a corresponding improvement in our margins because we will improve the overall utilization of our assembly and test assets, and as I said, we are balancing external and internal, but nonetheless running at a lower overall level of utilization, and we are working very hard to maintain the kind of margins and returns with the range of revenue possibilities that are out there if you try to model this business during a time of uncertainty.  So margins as utilization goes up and revenue goes up will indeed go up because there\u2019s a lot of operating expense leverage.  I think it\u2019s really tough to predict today when the snap back will occur, which I think was the second part of your question.  Certainly, my hope that with all the inventory that was burned in December or the lack of equilibrium between sell-in and sell-through and again in March, that by the time we get into the second half, the first thing you\u2019ll see is equilibrium.  You will see the benefit of no longer an inventory burn exacerbating the actual sell-through and it is my hope that you start to see a return to normal seasonal pattern where each subsequent quarter throughout the year gets a bit higher than the last, but it\u2019s too early to tell in this environment. ", "", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.", "Jay Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "You mentioned something in your prepared remarks about your balance sheet becoming a competitive tool.  Could you just expand on that a little bit?  I wanted to hear how that\u2019s actually playing out in the marketplace, and also a just a housekeeping question, if you could just repeat your guidance for interest expense.", "Liam Griffin", "", "With respect to the balance sheet and competitive dynamics, one of the things that we are seeing is that vendor selection criteria is really increasing right now, and there is much more scrutiny placed on suppliers.  When we start to look at a smaller cam, our customers realize that maybe two suppliers or one really good one is what we are looking for for some of these platforms, so what we are seeing is in addition to the technology that we use to differentiate, as Dave pointed out, our customers increasingly want to see our factories, they want to look at our fabs, and they want to look at balance sheets.  They want to have vendors and partners that are going to be able to stand up and endure this market correction and also be there when the market returns and be able to deliver on the upside, so that has been an increasingly important part of our strategy right now with our customers, and our results have done the talking for us so to speak here.  I can tell you that we\u2019ve actually in one business increased our share as a result of our financial strength and operational utility and performance.", "", "Jay Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "It doesn\u2019t seem like your competitors have much of a balance sheet to stand on.", "Dave Aldrich", "", "Here is another way to answer that question.  We have been, there\u2019s a silver lining, and it\u2019s not a very big one, but there is a silver lining in this downturn and that is that, as Don in the prepared comments, we\u2019re a profitable company, we are generating cash, had $75 million last quarter, I think $50 or something the quarter before, and we were able to apply that cash to buying convertible debt back at a discount, so what we are seeing is that not only the customers like it because they are engaged in platform that perhaps won\u2019t be launched in two or three years, so they want to make sure you\u2019re going to be around and that you\u2019ll continue to invest.  It\u2019s a tactical pragmatic question that they ask of their suppliers, but the other thing that\u2019s happening is if you look at our behavior throughout this downturn, because our margins are reasonably high because we can flex the fab-lite and because we continue to generate cash flow, we are able to be very selective about where we cut, so we think the actions we took in January were really quite strategic.  There wasn\u2019t anything panicky about.  It wasn\u2019t defensive.  We were able to apply some of our most talented resources to areas where we were quite confident we were going to make money, and we were able to portfolio manage in a very methodical way out of areas that we are not going to add a lot of value.  It wasn\u2019t let\u2019s cut across the board because we need to generate cash to satisfy debt or anything like that.  We think that\u2019s a big differentiator.", "Don Palette", "Jay, just one last thing and I\u2019ll put that in perspective.  Dave mentioned it, but we generated $174 million in cash from operation in \u201808, $75 million in the first quarter, that\u2019s $250 million cash flow from operations in the last five quarters, so it really has strengthened the company, and to your interest expense question, it is about $300K.  That is what you should assume in the model.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Aalok Shah with Davidson & Co.", "Aalok Shah \u2013 Davidson & Company", "Dave, on new product front, how should we be thinking about that this year?  We\u2019ve been talking about one major new customer this year ramping.  How should we start to frame around that?", "David Aldrich", "You know what\u2019s interesting is that in spite of the softness nobody is taking their pedal off the metal in terms of our customers on product introduction.  In fact, in some cases it accelerated as they try to differentiate and get back into saddle with new products, so the challenge here is that you\u2019re navigating through this period of uncertainty while at the same time it seems like the rate of introduction is accelerating.  So you should see more of these vertical market or these adjacent market products rolling out.  We\u2019ve got platforms aimed at new smart phone introductions that are being introduced in the first half of this year, and again these broad catalog linear products where we continue to try to create the snowball effect of more highly characterized broad-based components that we sell through distribution and then through a rep network that is part of the catalog business.", "Aalok Shah \u2013 Davidson & Company", "  ", "Do you think you\u2019re going to see a lot more of an edge mix in the first half or second half of the year given the uncertainty in the market right now, or are you going to start see some more traction on the WCDMA side of things?", "Liam Griffin", "Certainly WCDMA was lackluster in 2008, but that is one area of the market that everybody expects to grow in 2009, so we are going to see some growth in WCDMA, and that\u2019s going to drive $3 to $4 of content, typically with an EDGE FEM that may be a couple of dollars with multiple WCDMA bands, so that\u2019s going to happen.  We\u2019re also seeing something that is very promising for us.  We have a pretty deep position in China on handsets, and that\u2019s largely been GPRS FEMs.  We\u2019re starting to now see our baseband partner deliver EDGE-based solutions.  Skyworks in on board, and we\u2019re seeing quite healthy demand for that, so we may be surprised with some EDGE growth in China as well.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Alexander with Charter Equity Research.", "Michael Alexander \u2013 Charter Equity Research", "In your fab-lite strategy, are there any formal obligations you have with your partners and our suppliers?", "Dave Aldrich", "We do keep these relationships very close.  We also have more of a we-get, you-get kind of a strategy, so when the markets are strong, our supply partners benefit.  When the markets are soft, they obviously don\u2019t, and we don\u2019t have what you might call condo capacity agreements, take or pay agreements.  In fact, I don\u2019t think we have any of those at this point.  It\u2019s not a contractual obligation.  It is more the nature of the partnership which is that we want to share the business in a way that it\u2019s good business for both our suppliers and ourselves, and so we maintain our high level of utilization and we keep some business going through our supply chain.", "Michael Alexander \u2013 Charter Equity Research", "The composition of the debt that\u2019s left?", "Don Palette", "We have $97 million of converts, $47 million of that is a 2012 tranche at 1.5% interest and $50 million is due March 2010, and that\u2019s at 1.25%.", "Operator", "At this time, there appear to be no further questions.  I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Aldrich for any additional or closing comments.", "Dave Aldrich", "Thank you so much for listening.  This concludes our call today.

This call is been recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Tom Schiller, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Schiller, please go ahead.", "Thomas Schiller", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks' second fiscal quarter 2009 conference call.", "Joining me today is Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Don Palette, our Chief Financial Officer and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing.", "Dave will begin today's call with a business overview followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines to your questions. Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of the certain risk and uncertainties including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time-to-time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we'll discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relation's section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "I would now turn over the call to Dave, for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Tom and welcome everyone. This afternoon, we released second fiscal quarter 2009 results and I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress on our strategic initiatives. Namely, gaining share in our core markets, diversifying into adjacent analog segments and improving upon our operational execution. Specifically, the Skyworks team delivered revenue of 173 million versus guidance of 168 and we've maintained gross margins essentially flat, sequentially at 40% and on a year-over-year basis, despite the dramatic economic downturn.", "We've reduced our operating expenses by more than $25 million on an annualized basis and we posted $0.12 of EPS, this is $0.02 better than consensus and above our guidance of between $0.10 and $0.11. We generated positive cash flow from operations and we exited with $268 million of cash. Our performance was highlighted by strength in newer applications including energy management and smart grid technologies, we'll talk more about that in a moment. China 3G base stations, e-book reading devices, smart phones and push-to-talk platforms.", "So on today s call, we'll be discussing how would broadening our market in product footprints while improving our operational execution to emerge in even stronger and an even more profitable company as the markets recover.", "So, first on the diversification front. During the quarter, we captured energy management design wins in support of Itron, Sensus, and Landis and Gear. This particular space has impressive growth potential. Utilities, business and consumers are demanding enhanced billing efficiency, usage monitoring, and increasingly power control to prevent costly burnouts and potentially catastrophic blackouts.", "In fact, Gardener, a leading third-party research firm, expects more than 150 million smart readers to be installed worldwide in the next five years. Now this is creating an incremental semiconductor opportunity of roughly $2 billion by the year 2012.", "I think it's also worth noting that the recent American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has allocated $4 billion for advanced metering projects and given our engagements with key energy management system providers, we are seeking to win a significant share of this opportunity.", "During the quarter, we also ramped our suite of infrastructure solutions at Wireway (ph) and have recently secured several design wins to ZTE (ph), both in support of strengthening 3G demand within China.", "Specifically we are delivering mixers, amplifiers and receivers, and are moving from $3 of addressable content per LAN cards (ph) to upwards of about $20 with some of our more highly integrated solutions. Meanwhile, we continue to broaden our analog product catalog business. This business supports a wider range of applications including medical, avionics, automotive, broadband, industrial applications.", "During this quarter, we released a number of new products including low-noise amplifiers, silicon VCO synthesizers and variable voltage attenuators.", "I'm particularly excited about our newest family of LNAs or low-noise amplifiers based on our recent design traction within high performance infrastructure, GPS and satellite radio applications.", "On the smartphone front, this is another key diversification sector for Skyworks. We are gaining momentum across several key OEMs, particularly as they seek to integrate more bands, more modes; Bands 1, Bands 2, 3, 2, 5 and 8, as well as WiFi functionality for efficient global network roaming and seamless hand offs.", "Skyworks is uniquely positioned to provide all of this required functionality with improved power efficiency with smaller footprint and with lower product cost structure. As a result, we're also strengthening our design partnerships with the key base bands suppliers, including Qualcomm, Broadcom, Mediatech, Texas Instruments and Finnan, Marvell and SP Ericsson.", "Speaking of Qualcomm, we recently expanded our partnership leveraging our integrated front end modules into growing number of their 2G, 3G and HSDPA reference designs.", "I think it's also worth mentioning, the recent re-emergence of push-to-talk applications of RIM and Motorola driven by Sprint's Nextel network. Given the complex power and network handshake issues related to the IBM (ph) protocol, we've developed over the years, highly customized modules for this application.", "Skyworks maintains a majority position in this segment and to the degree the push-to-talk continues its rebirth as an effective field's communication tool, we tend to be the main beneficiary.", "And finally, as a very timely example we are providing solutions for an entirely new and increasingly popular e-book reading platform, developed by one of the world's largest online retailers. This represents another analog intensive and power critical application for us.", "So what's coming across all of these as well as other program ramps is that we are leveraging our core, analog, mixed signal and systems integration expertise, into emerging applications that are defined by much longer product life cycles, higher margin profiles, that are commencement with the value of our technical innovation. In other words, our customers are willing to pay us for our efforts in these segments.", "So in addition to expanding our market presence, we're continuing to drive operational improvements and believe that the success of our fab-lite manufacturing strategy, by the way which we commenced several years ago, is beginning to exhibit meaningful financial results for us.", "To be clear our fab-lite strategy refers to our hybrid manufacturing model where we have partnered with external foundry supplies in Taiwan and China to create second sources of our capability, utilizing our quality systems and our toolsets.", "This approach allows us to better balance external capacity with the demands of the market. Internally, our utilization remains high and we therefore are able to maintain margins and return on invested capital on a much broader range of revenues. We believe, we demonstrated this capability last quarter as we're able to maintain 40% gross margin on lower revenue -- on a lower revenue basis, and as we guided, we expect improving gross margins in the June quarter.", "At the same time, we are continuously driving improved yields, higher equipment utilization and lower cycle times. Together, our fab-lite model and disciplined cost reduction initiatives have resulted in a lower overall cost structure, driving higher margins as well as strong cash flow generation.", "So in closing, we're creating a uniquely diversified company, with the scale derived from high volume applications applied to a broad range of margin rich, analog products and markets. And accordingly the stage is set for accelerating top and bottom growth as the markets eventually stabilize and as they recover.", "Okay. I'll now turn this over to Don for his review. Don?", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks Dave, and thanks again everyone for joining us today. Revenue for the quarter was 173 million versus guidance of 168 million and 201.7 million a year ago. Gross profit was 69.2 million or 40% of revenue.", "Our ability to maintain gross margin level in the 40% range despite the decrease in revenue, is being driven by the flexibility of our fab-lite model, enabling us to maintain high levels of utilization, improved equipment efficiencies at all of our factories, progress on yield improvement initiatives, double-digit year-over-year material cost reductions, and continued migration to a richer product mix.", "Operating expenses were 47.9 million, of which R&D was 27.4 million and SG&A was 20.5 million, yielding 21.2 million of operating income. Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was 800,000 of expense, while taxes were 400,000. As a result net income was 20 million or $0.12 of diluted earnings per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet; we exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 268 million. Of note, we generated 22 million in cash flow from operations, recorded 12 million of depreciation and invested six million in capital expenditures.", "At a higher level, we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet, translating improving business performance into a higher cash balance. To that end, over the past year we've increased our cash balance from 228 million at the end of Q2 fiscal 2008, to 268 million at the end of Q2 fiscal 2009, while simultaneously reducing our convertible debt from 200 million last year to 97 million today. That's an increase in our net cash position of 143 million.", "As we have discussed over the past several quarters, balance sheet strength is increasingly a key competitive advantage in winning business, particularly, in this challenging economic environment. Customers and suppliers alike are seeking partners who not only proving innovative solutions, but are also financially are well positioned to support their long term, road maps. This is yet another area where we believe Skyworks is distinguishing itself.", "Now to our business outlook for the third fiscal quarter of 2009. Although we remain cautious on the macro-economy, we intend to resume top and bottom-line growth in the current quarter through share gains and broader participation in new markets. Specifically, we are guiding June quarterly revenue to be up 5% sequentially to 182 million.", "Operationally, we expect gross margin to expand to between 40 and 40.5% and project operating expenses of approximately 49 million.", "Below the line, we anticipate 800,000 in expense for net interest and other expense, and taxes at a 3% cash rate, driving $0.14 of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, a 15% sequential improvement in profitability off a base of 168 million shares.", "That concludes our prepared remarks.", "Operator, let's open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Very good. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Suji De Silva with Kaufman Brothers.", "Suji De Silva - Kaufman Brothers", "Hi Dave, hi Don. That's a good quarter (ph) guys.", "David Aldrich", "Suji, thank you.", "Donald Palette", "Thank you.", "Suji De Silva  - Kaufman Brothers", "Quick question. I guess, were you on 10% customers and are you still progressing toward having more of them at the end of this year?", "Donald Palette", "Hi Suji. This is Don. The 10% customers for the quarter were Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Motorola and just its worth noting that LG and Nokia were right behind in the single digits for the quarter.", "Suji De Silva  - Kaufman Brothers", "Great. And you talked about diversifying smartphones, can you tell me where you are split wise, 3GH versus 2G and whether smart phones is a material part of that?", "Donald Palette", "Yeah, for the quarter for 2G and 3G we're at 50% and for WEDGE 3G we're at 50%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Hello.", "Operator", "Uche you line is open. Now pick up your handset. Again, Uche Orji UBS are you there? Pause just a moment, you may have to pick up your handset, we're not hearing you, check your mute button.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Yes please. Can you hear me?", "Operator", "Yes we can.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "All right. Can I just ask you starting off with, how much more of gains in terms of market share momentum you see specifically if I look at the Nokia decision to put Infineon on the Edge platform is kind of opportunity for you. So any more color on to how much opportunity to gain share that would be helpful?", "David Aldrich", "Liam and I'll both answer that. We are today just beginning a ramp at Nokia that's been perhaps a little over a year from now. We are heavily weighted on -- a year ago. We are heavily weighted in 3G and of course you've seen some of their volumes has shifted to the middle or low tier. However, I'm really happy to say that our relationship has deepened and now we're been lined out across their products spectrum and we expect to see sequential growth continuing in Nokia although they're not a 10% customer. The fact is, we're probably in less than 10% of Nokia's phone today, and we fully expect to be at least a third of that over the course of the next couple of years.", "Liam Griffin", "Right. I think the platform you mentioned Uchi, can you mention that again please?", "Uche Orji - UBS", "I mean Nokia announced that Infineon was going to be on the EDGE platforms. So I'm not sure whether we're going to have this specific product in the year that they're going to be shipping, but there was an announcement that Nokia made and I was wondering whether you were well with Infineon?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, yes we are on board and that platform is shipping starting this quarter.", "Uche Orji - UBS", "Okay. Just one more question. If I look at your margins, they've held steady even through the difficult revenue environment. If I look forward, how should I expect that the drivers of the margin to trend? I know you'll say it's going to be up next quarter, but my sense is between ASPs utilization rates, which you mentioned as high already, what could keep gross margins going if I look down the line say for the rest of the year?", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "I think Dave and I both jump in on that question but one of the things is that, our utilization rates are high, but there is still going to be some volume upside that you'll see given our fixed cost base. So that's one of the things that are going to drive that. We'll have the 6-inch line coming on in early 2010. That's another step function for us to drive margin improvement. We continue to drive one of the things that we do a very good job of is driving year-over-year material cost reductions, which in a lot of cases more than offset any of the pricing adjustments.", "That's going to continue. And then as you see the shift to 3G and the multimode components that we're providing, there's higher dollar content and with that we believe comes higher margin. So those are some of the big drivers that you expect -- we expect to see in the business.", "David Aldrich", "We're also seeing with this expanding footprint in our catalog business and some of newer applications we were talking about. They're materially higher margins than what you think are traditionally at Skyworks. So a combination of the utilization and operational aspects is not described and improving mix is going to continue to give us we believe a headroom and growth in the gross margin and an operating income, because our OpEx will remain relatively flat as we grow the top-line.", "Operator", "Our next question is from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.", "George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer", "Thank you for taking my question. Dave, when you look at the smart meter opportunity, can you give us an idea of how much revenue you're getting from that right now and how you expect that to grow either with the stimulus spending and just the normal plans the utilities companies have?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, this is Liam. So with respect to the smart metering opportunity, we think that this is got tremendous potential for Skyworks. Today, it's a relatively small source of revenue for us. It is growing. It was up sequentially in the March quarter. It will be up again in June. And what we're seeing here is the market that if you look at the Gardner estimates we mentioned, we are seeing at least 150 million meters being upgraded to wireless technology from '09 to 2012 and each meter could have three to five to $6 of content available for Skyworks.", "So, we are seeing this come together quite nicely. A number of utilities have rolled our platforms Southern Cal Edison (ph), Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric, and the carriers the customers that we're working with of course are on metering side; Itron, Sensus. So, its early innings for us. We really like the dynamics. There is definite convergence to wireless technology and I believe this is going to be a strong driver for us over the next several years.", "David Aldrich", "If you look at the products. We've been developing products now for this market. We identified this some ago. It's a nice adjacent segment for us. We've been able -- we are very fortunate to be able to get in with the right set of customers. I think from a design relationship, OEM relationship standpoint, I think we're way ahead in this market.", "George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer", "Are the margin is in this business inline with the rest of the margin in the Linear business and when you look at, those 150 million meters that are coming on, what type share do you think you could have with the customers you're working with. What kind of share do they have right now?", "David Aldrich", "The margin are terrific in this space. As you would expect from a utility base market, margins are terrific for us. We expect to have a very high share. The products that we are addressing today are serving, think about it as an underutilized market where a lot of these current solutions or the older solutions in place today are very discreet. They consume a lot of power. They require more diagnostics and we've developed solutions that are elegantly simple we think for these providers to deploy.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tim Luke with Barclays.", "Tim Luke - Barclays", "Thanks so much. Just to clarify with respect to the calling on smart meters, is this a business that could be a sort of double digit percentage of the mix and say and exiting 2010 or in 2011 or how should we think about that?", "David Aldrich", "I think that's pretty intuitive and in that timeframe that's a good way to think about it. It's going to take a little while. It's not insignificant today and is growing very healthy sequentially in this quarter. In a down market, it's a little bit if you will recession-proof in many ways. There's a lot of green initiatives under way. Incidentally the stimulus package has monies earmarked for our customers here or at least in territories in which in areas which we'll be deploying product. And so, I think you're thinking about this right. We do believe it can be a double-digit percentage of our revenue. We also believe its going to take a period of time to get there.", "Donald Palette", "Yeah, let me just add that, right now, much of the data that we've discussed is largely U.S. based, North American based. Europe is also engaged. If you look out five to seven years from now, I think this is going to be a very big deal in markets like China, where there is quite a bit of work being done right now on the conservation side, on the clean energy side. So as Dave pointed out, there are number of initiatives in place to make this happen.", "By the way the payback for the utility is almost immediate here just in cost savings and power control. So a lot of macro things behind us.", "Tim Luke - Barclays", "As you look forward to the landscape, could you give some color on how you feel about broad inventory levels with your customers and for you and how you think seasonality may trend now with you having a stronger second quarter. Do you feel now that you're likely to see a firmer September period as well or how should we think about it? And then separately if I may, in recent commentary from some players selling into the China 3G market, they're suggesting its being strong in the first quarter, its going to be strong in the second quarter, but did expect something of a pause as the deployments are absorbed in the second half of the year. How do you think about that for you guys?", "David Aldrich", "Okay. Let me start with the inventory question. We did see for the most part the inventory levels begin to stabilize, but there are independent pockets which would be above or below the equilibrium line here in the March quarter. But generally, the trends on inventory looked better. There was a burn in most markets. So we do see that stabilizing. And that again sets us up we believe for a better second half for the marketing channel, so we believe that.", "With respect to China, we commented on the opening remarks here that we are seeing a rollout of 3G technologies. We are seeing carriers like China Mobile begin to spend in a meaningful way. For us Wireway and ZTE are the drivers. We have a very good position Wireway and ZTE share for Skyworks is being growing every quarter. So, we're going to benefit from that. I'm not seeing any reason for that business to come down in the second half Tim. So we feel pretty good about it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks guys and congrats. Back to an earlier question on diversification of Nokia's base end players, you said you are in the Infineon platforms. The other new base end players for Nokia Broadcom, Qualcomm and potentially others, how do you feel your position is with those and is that a driver, is that the primary driver is that just an ancillary driver of your growth in NOK?", "David Aldrich", "I think there are, the driver of the growth in Nokia is their desire to diversify their supplier base with companies who started out being, really filling gap on the edge of CDMA and increasingly have the supply chains and the scale drive volumes across their portfolio. So, we have spent several years now being qualified and getting to a position where they have the confidence in us and we have the roadmap for them that is going to allow us to be lined out not only on the mid to high end but on the low mid and high mid.", "And as such this is a very disciplined company, they are very disciplined company as they have entertained new base partners. They've essentially in a sense limited the engagement of those baseband suppliers to our qualified PA suppliers. So there aren't many PA suppliers in Nokia. There aren't any, all that many baseband suppliers and you can kind of have see how that, how the alignment would be. So, we've been and unfortunately in parallel to the Nokia's drive to diversify and to bring us up to speed so on over the last couple of years.", "We've been working very hard across markets and applications with the very same baseband providers, the very same baseband providers. So our relationship with them is very strong. Our designs are consistent with their roadmaps. So, it is going to be a driver both coming at it from Nokia's desire and coming at it from our baseband relationships.", "Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great and then actually I have just couple of quick ones here, breakdown any color on breakdown of end markets are in segments of revenue, I know you shied away from giving those but you used to give a bit more color and it would definitely help for modeling?", "Donald Palette", "Cody, this is Don. The only breakdown that we've typically given is the spilt between the LP business and handset. And the number that came in this quarter was same as what we've previously seen and LP was in the 20 to 25% range and our handset business 75 to 80% of our revenue and the numbers can move a few points within that, but that's the range we've seen constantly for some period of time that hasn't changed.", "Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus", "All right then just finally OpEx trends; revenues starting to turn, can you take your foot off of that, the OpEx brake there a bit or do you -- are there initiatives in place that will continue to drive those OpEx lower throughout the year?", "Donald Palette", "Well we just guided for Q3, 49 million, of Q4, 49, 49.5 million is a reasonable number we've assumed. But no we are very focused on maintaining the cost base, we have in place right now. And we have a business model as revenue ramps, we are not going to see a lot of incremental expenses and that's where we're going to get the power of this leverage as we go forward, so I wouldn't expect that to move a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Stephen Ferranti with Stephens Inc.", "Neal Waggoner - Stephens Inc.", "Hey guys, this is Neal for Steve. You guys have talked about targeting long-term gross margin within a 42% range and operating margins in 20% range. I guess, one is that still a case. And then two, given your lower cost structure today, what kind of revenue run rate are you now assuming in those longer term rates?", "Donald Palette", "Hi Neal, this is Don. Yeah, we -- for the past year we've talked a lot about our operating model and in those presentations and given the cost structure we had in place at the time we were targeting that 250 million report in revenue to be at approximately 18% operating margin. And now with the cost reductions that we implemented this quarter through the initiative that we disclosed, we are now looking at and we see a clear path to be 18 to 20% operating margin, at about 230 million, quarterly revenue.", "Neal Waggoner - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Donald Palette", "Thanks", "Operator", "Our next question is from Todd Koffman with Raymond James.", "Todd Koffman - Raymond James", "Thank you. With regard to the June quarter comments on gross margin being bumping up a little bit off, I think it's a 40 to 40.5, what is your current mix between internal manufacturing and external outsourced manufacturing? Thank you.", "Donald Palette", "Right now for assembly and test services, it's all internal. We are not outsourcing any of that. We have a copy exact of cash wafer provider in Taiwan that does continue to run, that we keep moving, and we are looking at about 10% -- 10 to 15% of our wafer volume is coming from that fab in Taiwan, the rest of its all internal generated.", "Todd Koffman - Raymond James", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ours next question is in from Mike Burton with ThinkEquity.", "Mike Burton - ThinkEquity", "Hey guys and congrats on the quarter. First, can you just talk a little bit about the pricing environment right now? There has been some discussion from some of the OEMs about extracting some price concessions out of the component suppliers?", "David Aldrich", "Well, we've seen -- there is always pricing pressure in the most commoditized segment of the handset business. We're seeing kind of think of it bifurcated this way on the WEDGE and smartphone its really a play where we're adding more content and as each subsequent generation has come in, we're tending to have more complicated switching and amplification over more bands and modes. And so while there is always a desire on our part to work with our OEMs to lower the bill-of-material costs, it hasn't translated in to lower dollar content per phone. In fact it's been going the other way.", "On the other hand on the very low end, we've been developing new products and processes that are allowing us to support the most sensitive area, which is the emerging markets, which I think is the right kind of delicate mix between the right performance and the right cost structure. So we were picking up some share on the ultra low end.", "Last year we saw our ASPs decline in the 7% range and that's part-to-part. We didn't see that decline in the dollar per phone, so we saw in overall. And I think year-to-date that's been roughly the same.", "Liam Griffin", "Right, right, that's right.", "Mike Burton - ThinkEquity", "Is the margin structure roughly the same between then, between the smartphone and the low end segment or is there...", "David Aldrich", "There is certainly more and more margin dollars on the high end because if you think about it, in our business, we're driving those similar processes and that fixed cost structure across a certain set of markets and customers. So as the dollar content goes up, the contribution margin -- the variable contribution margin is high across the board. So, I would say that we clearly get more dollars of contribution from the high end margin or similar.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Nathan Johnson with Pacific Crest.", "Nathan Johnson - Pacific Crest", "Hi, thanks for taking my call. I was wondering if you could elaborate in looking at the sequential growth you expect in revenue for next quarter. How much of that is expected to be from market share gains? How much is expected to be from actual improvement in end-market demand and then how much of that is more due to inventory re-balancing at key customers?", "David Aldrich", "Well let me try to answer in a different -- there is a lot in that question. I would say that if you look at the way we're guiding and we're thinking about our business today, while we are cautiously optimistic about the end-markets in the second half, we still need to work through some inventory. We are seeing improved visibility. That's very important first step at recovery and we are seeing new programs ramping that we're excited about.", "So, I think that if you look at our guidance, we are attempting to be very, very conservative because the market is still going through a choppy patch here. So, we guided to be 5% up and we did that to be appropriately conservative given the uncertainty that still exists in the market despite our cautious optimism.", "Nathan Johnson - Pacific Crest", "Okay, great that's helpful. I was also hoping on if could elaborate on -- you talked a little bit about base stations deployments or equipment for deployment in China. I was wondering that if you could elaborate on what you are seeing on the handset front. Are you guys seeing inventory build ahead of the 3G launches and Labor Day holidays or is there kind of a more of a wait and see attitude for handsets going into China?", "David Aldrich", "Yeah, I think the market in China appears to be showing some signs of improvement here. We are seeing some TD-SCDMA deployments on the handset or we're even seeing some CDMA deployments, but we're also seeing some pick up driven by China Mobile not only on GSM, but also for the first time some meaningful volumes in EDGE. So in general, that market looks good. It is an important part of our business as you know, and we're quite pleased with our position there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Thank you very much. I want to go back to Nokia for a minute if we could. Last year Dave, I think your expectations was that Nokia would probably about a 10% customer on a run rate level by the December quarter. That didn't happen. It appears that the Broadcom EDGE project Dave, now is being delayed several quarter. And then I know you're a primary FEM supplier to that line. Where is Nokia in your planning today? Do you expect them to hit 10% anytime this year on a run rate level?", "And should we model like a slower growth rate but consistent gains there because you got a lot of upsides still and it sounds like you're being deployed on more and more products. I'm just trying to get a feel for some of the main platforms that you are on, that would give you such optimism last year, just the way if there's other problems going on?", "And then secondly, where are those gains? You are doing very well on revenue and you are growing better than most of your peers. Where are you making these gains as the Koreans rim, the Chinese via Qualcomm, just trying to get a feel for where you are filling up the way you have all group left to go?", "David Aldrich", "As the situation with Nokia is that we entered that account -- our initial design wins were all in the WEDGE platform. And as you know that the markets for 3G were hit pretty hard here. And so the fact that we were participating in the mid-to-high Tier not the mid-to-low Tier meant that this particular customer's volume was weighted towards a segment in which we didn't participate.", "We are fixing that and I think you sounds like you've been doing some due diligence there, but we are fixing that. They want us to participate and we're going to participate. So you should absolutely think of them as being, becoming a 10% customer and our expectation and our aspirations are obviously much higher than that.", "In terms of where we're seeing strength as we talked about in our prepared comments; we are seeing strength in this smartphone segment. We are seeing strength among some of these newer applications, which that are beginning to ramp. We're seeing strength in China infrastructure. We're seeing relative strength coming from our Korean customers in that they have taken share and we've taken share with them. And we have some pretty strong partnerships in China that are allowing us to address a very, very broad footprint of indigenous OEMs within China. We're very close to Mediatech for example.", "And we've been working very, very hard for last couple of years and are beginning to see the fruits of that with our Qualcomm reference designs. In the past, we participated with the Qualcomm baseband but it's been designed in after the reference design was released. We've rectified that situation and we are on increasing more of those platforms. That's where it's coming from.", "Operator", "Our next question will then come from Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson", "Hi, guys a couple of quick questions. Don, can you hear me?", "Donald Palette", "Yes.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson", "Okay, on the cost of good sold line, it looks like you had an inventory write off. Was that all related to the transceiver business?", "Donald Palette", "Correct, that was part of the restructuring.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson", "So a 100% of that was transceiver or was there any other write downs also in there?", "Donald Palette", "None at all.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson", "Okay. And then in terms of tax rate, what should we think about going forward now?", "Donald Palette", "It's consistent with what we communicated last several calls. We guided 3% this quarter and I think it's three to 4% in the fourth quarter, that's going to be in the ballpark. And then 2010 and 11 we have enough of our NOLs to carry forward that we are projecting and some R&D tax credits as well. We are projecting our cash tax rate to be approximately 15% in 2010 and 11.", "That's the way you build your models.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson", "Okay. And then last question from me; in terms of bookings this quarter, I mean I guess fully booked to the guidance now at this point?", "David Aldrich", "Yeah, if you look at the orders we have in hand today coupled with our hub forecast, we are right around 90% at this stage.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson", "Okay. Great thanks a lot guys.", "Donald Palette", "Thank you.", "David Aldrich", "Thank you.", "Liam Griffin", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Alex (ph) with JMP Securities.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yeah, thanks very much. I wonder if I could ask a question about the passive wireless subscription model and the e-book model, wondering what kind of engagements you are seeing right now? How much interest? Is there anyway you can quantify may be the opportunity beyond what's already in the market like your expectations might be we say in 2010? Thank you.", "Liam Griffin", "We think this is a entirely new category. It's difficult to see what the long-term growth prospects are going to be but we believe what we even think so far is been great and its been ahead of our expectations. So, one of the things to remember is that this technology is relatively new. It typically engages 3G networks, which means a lot of content for Skyworks and for the smartphone. And there appears to be a whole different subscriber base that's interested in this type of technology.", "So it's a very early. Early forecast, the forecast that we have seen so far been exceeded by our customers and we think this could be a nice addition to our existing wireless system (ph) on forth.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. and then it is a follow up, I'm wondering what kind of activity are you seeing on 3G and 3G transition to LTE 4G and also may be a breakdown in your expectations between what the market might be doing in terms of multi-mode and back switch compatibility?", "David Aldrich", "Sure. Well obviously 3G is right now a very important part of the business and we've got great technology for that and it's going to be growing in 2009 for the industry and for Skyworks. And with respect to LTE, we think that's going to be a nice addition to overall market growth, and one of the things we are seeing we've been speaking with customers this week specifically on that.", "We are seeing a nice addition with respect to data cards where 3G devices or LTE devices will be deployed within data cards, which actually will add to the subscriber base. So when we talk about a normal handset market, 1.1, 1.2 billion we see a complementary data card market today that could compete with DSL and cable, and very high speed broadband networks typically deployed with LTE capability.", "Operator", "We'll next go to Tim Luke with Barclays.", "Tim Luke - Barclays", "Thank you so much, just my follow up was on just how you think about the potentials to levers for a target gross margin as you move into, over the next 12 to 18 months, how do you think about that do you think moving to a 41 to 42% level could be achievable going forward? Thank you.", "David Aldrich", "The answer is yes. We're quite sure it's achievable. And the way we get to Don talked about the fact that given the restructured company, the point at which we get to 20% or 18 to 20% operating income now is lowering from the 2.50 to the 2.25 or 2.30, and the way we get there is a combination of continuing to see high dollar content per phone in 3G and smartphone, continuing to add new market applications like energy, like e-book applications, like 3G infrastructure, 4G data card products. And the third is, we don't talk about it much but we've added some new ammunition if you will, to our catalogue products business.", "We now have a team of folks. Our applications teams over the last few years have got better and smarter in identifying opportunities where we can intersect the capability of the company with an undisturbed market with L&A with PCO synthesizers and so on mixers. As we build that business that's very much an annuity. I mean I love that business. It's annuity business. Product lifecycles measured in 5, 10, 15 years. You get designed in.", "No simple, single socket is large enough to entice a lot of competitors. There's not a lot of -- there's not much at all price sensitivity, so you get into the high margin and you stay in. And it's simply a business that builds and snowballs slowly, but quite predictably over time and that business now it is getting bigger and we're getting better at it frankly.", "Tim Luke - Barclays", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And with this that concludes the Q&A session. I would to turn that call to Dave Aldrich for any additional or closing comments.", "David Aldrich", "Well thank you everyone for participating and we very much look forward to updating you next quarter.", "Operator", "And with that, this concludes today's conference call.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Schiller Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Schiller, please go ahead, sir.", "Tom Schiller", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks\u2019 third quarter fiscal 2009 conference call. Joining me are Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Don Palette, our Chief Financial Officer; and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Liam will begin today\u2019s call with a business overview followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook.

Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relation\u2019s section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "I will now turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "Dave Aldrich", "Thanks Tom and welcome everyone. Well, despite the economic downturn, I am really very pleased to report that the Skyworks team delivered solid top and bottom-line performance in the June quarter and exceeded all of our key financial and operational targets.", "Throughout this difficult market, we\u2019ve been working diligently across Skyworks to remain focused on our customers and to become a better supplier and a stronger competitor. It\u2019s our firm belief that it\u2019s in times like this that provide opportunities to gain share, and to improve customer relations while at the same, streamlining our operations. Today, Don, Liam and I will be providing an update on these activities and our progress.", "Specifically in our third fiscal quarter, we delivered revenue of 191.2 million, that\u2019s up 11% sequentially. We expanded our gross margins to 40.5%. We improved operating income by 35% sequentially to a 15% operating margin today and we posted $0.16 of earnings per share and that\u2019s $0.02 better than our guidance. We generated $44 million of cash flow from operations, and we exited with $308 million of cash.", "At a higher level, our financial performance reflects the progress we are making towards realizing our longer term goal of becoming the world\u2019s leading supplier of analog semiconductors for mobile connectivity applications. ", "Our strategy, I think is really quite simple and straightforward. It\u2019s to leverage our scale and the capabilities we\u2019ve derived from our handset business to first consolidate and take share within our targeted markets; second, to gain increased traction within our analog catalogue business; third, to open new market segments with innovative products and solutions; and fourth, to deliver superior operating margins and return on investment.", "So I\u2019ll follow that format throughout this discussion today and to begin, I\u2019d like to discuss how we\u2019re gaining share in our targeted markets within both the high and low-end handset segments.", "On the high-end, growth of the smart phone category is a micro-trend today that in some ways is transforming our industry. Multimedia platforms are strategically important to us, given not only the increasing consumer demand for mobile voice for data, for video, but the related network capacity expansion needs of the service operators.", "This demand is fostering an industry-wide sea change and it\u2019s really not unlike the PC revolution of the 90s. In fact the smart phone is moving from a higher end tool reserved for corporate road warriors to an increasingly a mainstream communications platform, one that is truly changing the way we live, the way we work and the way we play.", "This segment equally, importantly has been embraced by carriers with a highly profitable stream of data service revenue. A little further down the food chain, our OEM customers demand for extended battery life for improved data rates for multi-band and multi-mode capability and for ever smaller devices, perfectly intersects with what we at Skyworks uniquely develop and deliver.", "As an example at a RIM, we have begun shipping our first 3G WCDMA PA products as they prepare to launch refresh platforms and this is an existing growth vector for us and it compliments our existing strength at RIM in CDMA and GPRS and in EDGE. Likewise at Samsung and LG, we\u2019re in the midst of an expansion as we move from supporting GPRS and EDGE handsets to multi-band wideband CDMA touch screen platforms and smart phones.", "Particularly, as they increasingly leverage Qualcomm, Broadcom and Infineon reference design, where we are a leading front-end module supplier and today I am very pleased to announce that we\u2019ve recently won our very first design at HTC, a leading Taiwanese 3G smart phone producer and with the addition of HTC today, Skyworks is now uniquely supporting all leading smart phones providers.", "In the low-end or the emerging market segments, we\u2019re seeing increasing strength driven by our scale and some recent market share gains. Additionally during the quarter, we acquired Axiom or completed the acquisition of Axiom Microdevices. Axiom is the world\u2019s only volume supplier of CMOS, silicon-based power amplifiers for mobile phones, the only supplier in the world.", "Through this acquisition we\u2019re complementing our existing leadership Gallium Arsenide capabilities. We\u2019re bolstering our fundamental intellectual property portfolio and it\u2019s allowing us to capture more share on the ultra low-end of the market, where cost often supersedes performance. We are now today, the largest provider of front-end solutions into this high-growth market segment that includes China, India, Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.", "Further, the addition of Axiom\u2019s product line underscores our commitment to providing our customers with the broadest, the most compressive suite of solutions on a process agnostic basis, to meet their unique platform, the unique geographic and cost base. Okay, now switching gears to the second prong of our strategy. We\u2019re continuing traction within our Analog Catalog business.", "During the quarter, we introduced several high linearity ultra low noise amplifiers to service a number of demanding receiver applications, including global positioning, satellite radio, infrastructure markets as well as ISM hubs repeaters and access points. I think, it\u2019s of note to say that we\u2019ve, first we have captured our first design win with Ericsson\u2019s base station business in support of Verizon\u2019s LTE network deployments as well.", "At the same time, we broadened our portfolio silicon-based VCO synthesizers, and RF mixers addressing 3G and 4G infrastructure applications. We\u2019ve recently won awards from Huawei, from Alcatel-Lucent, and Nokia-Siemens networks. Incidentally, our analog products catalog is a high margin business that now bodes nearly a thousand customers and a roster of customers is growing.", "Okay, continuing along, third, we are opening new market segments with innovative products and solutions. We\u2019ve added customers in the high growth energy management area, most recently beginning production at ESCO and Neptune, who joined our roster of Itron, Badger Meter, Landis and Gyr, and Sensus, some of the first movers in deploying new and retrofitted smart water, gas and electric meters worldwide. These strategic partnerships are enabling Skyworks to develop highly customized and high performance solutions for these growing smart grid applications.", "In wireless networking, another targeted vertical application for us; we\u2019ve recently captured our very first design win at Intel with their portfolio of 802.11b/g/n chipsets. Given Intel\u2019s market leaderships we\u2019re delighted by this initial in-road and intend to expand our engagement to encompass a wider variety of products and a wider variety of protocols.", "During the quarter we also ramped front-end solutions as part of Broadcom\u2019s wireless LAN reference design and as a result, are now enabling three of the world\u2019s top four netbook and notebook OEMs. I\u2019m also pleased to report that Skyworks is now supporting Microsoft Xbox gaming console and controller with advanced analog components. ", "Finally, from a new product and customer standpoint, we\u2019ve entered the mobile video market recently with reference design wins that are going into production this quarter at ZTE and [long share] in China.", "Our devices support not only handsets and smart phones but also PCs, notebooks and netbooks, which have the potential to serve as converge, TV and media devices. Like the smartphone trend we outlined earlier, we believe that mobile video applications have enormous long-term growth potential.", "According to CISCO, 64% of the world\u2019s mobile network traffic will be video, 64% by the year 2013 with 150% compounded growth between the years 2008 and 2013. This explosive growth is driven by mobile TV and web browsing as well as emerging applications including telemedicine, machine to machine, enhanced navigation, and interactive gaming. We are excited to be positioned very early in the mobile video market.", "Now lastly, the final element of our four-prong strategy, but certainly not least is to deliver superior operating margins and superior return on investment. We are in the process of creating a fairly unique business model that delivers consistent returns, more common to what you would expect from a diversified analog company, that enhanced our company.", "As evidenced in June, we delivered a 15% operating margin, and we are guiding to a 17% operating income performance in the current quarter. This is putting us on track to achieve our previously outlined target model earlier than expected. Given our product pipeline and the success of our fab light strategy and our leaner cost structure today, we now see a path to 20% operating margins at revenue levels significantly less than the 250 million quarterly model. ", "This is a new paradigm quite simply we\u2019re creating a uniquely diversified company with the scale derived from high volume applications, applied to a range of margin rich analog products and markets. As a result, we have never been better positioned to outperform our addressable markets to achieve our long term financial targets and most importantly to create shareholder value.", "I will now turn this over to Don for his financial review.", "Donald Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining us, everyone. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was 191 million, up 11% sequentially and versus our prior guidance of 5% growth from Q2\u2019s 173 million level. Gross profit was 77.5 million increasing to 40.5% of revenue and driven by improved equipment efficiencies at all of our factories, progress on yield improvement initiatives and ongoing material cost reductions.", "Operating expenses were 48.9 million, of which R&D was 28.1 million and SG&A was 20.8 million, yielding 28.6 of operating income, and a 15% operating margin. Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was 900,000 of expense while taxes were 600,000. As a result, net income was 27 million, or $0.16, of diluted earnings per share, $0.02 better than our guidance and consensus estimates.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $308 million, a $40 million sequential improvement in our cash balance even after the cash acquisition of Axiom. Of note, we generated 44 million in cash flow from operations, recorded 11 million of depreciation and invested 6 million in capital expenditures.", "At a higher level, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, focusing on translating improving business performance into a higher cash balance. We generated 140 million of cash flow from operations on a fiscal year-to-date basis. This balance sheet strength is increasingly a key competitive advantage as customers and suppliers alike seek to align with financially well-positioned partners who can support their long-term roadmaps.", "Now, to our business outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. Although, we remain cautious on the macro-economy, our expanding product, market and customer footprints are positioning us well for a strong second half of calendar 2009. Specifically, we expect revenue for the September quarter to up 10% sequentially.", "Operationally, we expect gross margin to expand to between 40.5% and 41%, and project operating expenses of approximately 50 million, yielding a 17% operating margin. Below the line, we anticipate 1 million in expense for net interest and other expenses and taxes at our 3% cash rate driving $0.19 of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share off of a base of 175 million shares.", "As a reminder, we had previously outlined that at $250 million in quarterly revenue we were targeting an 18% to 20% operating margin. Given continued growth in higher contribution margin products, operational plans in place including our six-inch wafer conversion in Newbury Park and leaner cost structure. ", "Today I am pleased to announce that our business model has the leverage to achieve a 20% operating margin at $240 million in quarterly revenue. At this near term revenue milestone, our performance translates into EPS approaching $1 per share on an annualized basis.", "Well, that concludes our prepared remarks and Operator, let\u2019s open the lines up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer.", "George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer", "Don, can you give us what the split is between the linear business and the handset business? Dave, I suspect a lot of the new application areas that you\u2019re looking at for growth is coming in linear side. Can you give us an idea on top of energy what others applications might be coming and the timing involved?", "Donald Palette", "Sure, George. I will jump in quick. The split between linear and our handsets space was similar past quarter. Linear was in the 20 to 25% range and handsets in the 75 to 80% range.", "Dave Aldrich", "Sure, George, and I think we talked about energy management. We talked about mobile video. You probably heard a lot about that recently today. We have products, for example, that are going in high volume or ramping into high volume that would be actually facilitating an analog TV signal in certain markets that\u2019s important.", "We\u2019re also seeing lot of these new VCO synthesizers and a high level silicon products going into 3 and 4G cellular infrastructure and back haul. We\u2019ve talked about our catalog business. We continue to expand and add new product families and low noise amplifiers, VCOs and receiver components.", "We talked about wireless LAN. We are pretty excited about the fact we can now talk about Intel as a volume customer. That\u2019s just beginning, just at the very at its infancy. With our ongoing relationship with Broadcom, we\u2019re now in, as of I think this quarter and next three of the four, largest laptop manufacturers in the world. That\u2019s a pretty big change from where we were six months ago. So I guess those would be some of the top ones that come to mind, George.", "George Iwanyc \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Following up on that, when you look at those applications ramping and the operating margin targeted 20% at 240 million, is the linear and handset mix staying in the same range? Is the long-term gross margin target still around 42%?", "Dave Aldrich", "Well, the short-term like I have to say now, the more immediate target that Don has defined as 20% operating income, we don\u2019t view that as a long-term model any longer. That occurs in about 240 million in revenue and our growth rate, we think we can begin to see that. I think longer term, we\u2019re really looking at a very different model I discussed in the prepared comments as paradigm shift.", "I am convinced that as we began to ramp more of these catalog products and penetrate more of these vertical markets and participant in the sweet spot of the cellular business, smart phones, for example, that we\u2019re going to start to create a financial model from a return on invested capital that\u2019s materially above our cost of capital and operating income that looks a lot more like an analog company.", "So when we talk about 20 points, I have to say, we\u2019re not talking about longer term model. We\u2019re kind of refining that as we go forward here, but we\u2019re getting pretty excited about what a diversified Skyworks looks like. It looks nothing like a cellular handset component company.", "Donald Palette", "George, just in the short-term, the 240, Dave described, we don\u2019t assume any change in only a product handset mix. We do not assume any change in that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Suji De Silva - Kaufman Brothers.", "Suji De Silva - Kaufman Brothers", "On the Intel win, can you guys give us a sense of what you think your share can go to there in the wireless LAN there?", "Liam Griffin", "Well, I saw Dave pointed out this is really a milestone win for Skyworks to break into this strategic account. Its early innings for us right now. We\u2019re delivering a control IC that was developed by our advanced analog design team, and we really feel that with Intel\u2019s view on wireless you see a lot more work.", "Now even cellular, in addition to the Wi-LAN, WiMAX, this could become a very meaningful growth element for us over the next few years. So, it\u2019s very early today. We\u2019re existed about the design win, but there is plenty of blue sky for us here.", "Suji De Silva - Kaufman Brothers", "Maybe on energy management, you guys talk about that potentially becoming a significant part of revenue, how is that tracking towards your expectations and maybe what percent of overall revenue is it now?", "Liam Griffin", "Well, it\u2019s tracking quite well. We continue to add new customers and I think that\u2019s the controllable factor for us. We have moved up just Itron, we have added ESCO and Sensus and Neptune, Landis and Gyr in Europe. So the customer portfolio is looking very good. ", "The business is growing, it\u2019s steady and I think a progressive rate of growth, there is a lot of stimulus behind it, there are some real macro tailwinds behind this. It is still relatively small in terms of mixed forces, less than 10% of revenues, but we think compound growth rates on this will be among the best across our analog portfolio over the next three to five years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Koffman - Raymond James.", "Todd Koffman - Raymond James", "I just wanted to ask, Skyworks now has emerged as the clearly defined most profitable player amongst your peers, but this industry historically has had some trouble with maintaining that consistency. Is there anything as you look structurally at the landscape that might lead you to believe that maybe the sustainability of consistency could last a little bit longer than it has in the past?", "Dave Aldrich", "", "Well, maybe, Don and I can tiger team the question, Todd, and I appreciate your comment on our consistency or our margins. A couple of things are happening, first of all I think if you go back and look at us for now several quarters, and that since we exited the base business, which was an inherently volatile business where we didn\u2019t have the competitive advantages to have a sustainable financial improving model.", "We now are focused in areas that we can use as a springboard to continue to diversify our business. So the difference today is there are far fewer players. We see fewer competitors in our targeted markets or our more mature markets if you will, and that\u2019s because the complexity of the product is getting higher, the need for scale not only in manufacturing and R&D is becoming a higher hurdle.", "The hurdle rate is going higher, products are becoming multi-band, multi-mode, because simultaneous voice and data and that place too are strengthened against this single or largest component [ph] companies. We\u2019ve seen a lot of share consolidating around the broad based suppliers and there are far fewer of them today in handsets.", "Our market now today, a couple of years ago, a reasonable knock against Skyworks, well you are not doing that much with Qualcomm reference design, you don\u2019t have much at Nokia. Well today those two things are well behind us. So now we are shifting really to every major I could say every handset OEM, and every smart phone manufacturer, every major smart phone manufacturer.", "We also have vertical markets that we spend a lot of time dissecting and supporting customers there with innovative designs that has taken us years and we are beginning to penetrate. Those in the margins there are simply terrific compared to what you might have thought of in this industry and our Catalog business continues to expand. ", "The difference is, we are diversified, we have a fab-like model, we invest less in capital than our growth rate would suggest we would need for other competitors perhaps. We are not a handset component company anymore, so I think over time you won\u2019t think of us as in that way. You will think of us as a diversified company with far less volatility.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Barclays Capital.", "Merck Lutcher - Barclays Capital ", "This is [Merck Lutcher] calling in for Tim Luke. Thanks for taking my question. Just two quick ones. Number one, more current on inventory in the channel, where do you see the inventory cracking going forward? Is it like towards the normal range or expected above?", "Liam Griffin", "Inventory appears to be stabilizing. There certainly were and continue to be some pockets of imbalance, but for the most part we believe throughout the June quarter a lot of that fully recovered to normal levels, now again, there are pockets of opportunity there. Again, as we look through the next quarter, we start to see customer demand and inventory making much more sense, and more consistent with [periods]\u2026", "Merck Lutcher - Barclays Capital ", "The next question is more of a longer-term. For handsets in LTE, how do you see the ASPs and margins devolving in when the industry transitions to LTE?", "Liam Griffin", "In LTE there is very few platforms right now that are in production, Ericsson has a few. We think that that is going to be an exciting element of the whole mobile Internet that Dave spoke of. It\u2019s going to provide tremendous data rates consistent with a DSL and cable, albeit with a wireless connection.", "We also see that the LTE platforms are probably not going to be traditional handset-like devices. You may see them more in ultra mobile PCs or notebooks or even data cards. The margins should be very high and Skyworks by the way has a very strong portfolio across in LTE suite, power amplifiers, LNAs and control IC, so we look forward to that trend.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Uche Orji - UBS.", "Parag - UBS", "This is Parag for Uche. First question, could you say who are the 10% customer, and also if you are able to sneak in LG and Nokia as a 10% customer?", "Don Palette", "Sure. This is Don. We had four 10% customers during the quarter. We had Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Motorola and LG and Nokia actually was in the high single digits for the quarter as well.", "Parag - UBS", "Secondly, you have indicated share gains. I was just wondering whether the share gains have been driven largely by share gains by your customer or you have been gaining shares at existing customers that is increasing your penetration and existing customers.", "Don Palette", "I will have to say in terms of OEM share shifts benefiting us, we \u2013 it\u2019s nice to see LG as a 10% customer, Samsung continuing to gain strength. We are at the first inning of our growth in Nokia, but the flipside is that we are diversified enough within our handset business that share shifts among OEMs tend to have less of a whipsaw to our business model, and that we have been striving for that for a long time.", "I would say it is the growth in general is far more around penetration of the smart phone category, gaining share on the low-end category and non-handset applications then we were lucky enough to be with one OEM and not another OEM and they are winning. That\u2019s really not our business. That was Skyworks two years ago, that\u2019s not so much our business today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Cody Acree - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks, guys and congrats on a great quarter. You talk about being more diversified and definitely an applaud for that, but those of us who have had a history with Skyworks seeing the prior transceiver base band, the software solution business, I think the distraction maybe or at least the diversity that it took away from your power amplifier core module business.", "What happened when you focused back on that core power module business, the market share gains that you have seen in Nokia and some of the major OEMs? Do you spend a lot of time in your commentary talking about the increasing diversity, which has a lot of puts and takes, has a lot of positives, but does it run a risk of getting off of maybe focus?", "Liam Griffin", "", "That\u2019s an intriguing question, Cody, and a good one. The shorter answer is no because all of the product markets we are talking about, every single one of them have some very common DNA. They are analog circuits. IC is perhaps module based, but they are all around a very narrow set of, we think very deep core strengths of the company.", "Our ability to design and manufacture multi-chip module technologies and different process technologies are process in difference when it comes to what\u2019s the best process for the function within the analog domain and RF power amplifier switches, they are all within that footprint. Yes different voltages, different power levels. So we view them as being very, very similar from a core intellectual property standpoint.", "Where they differ and where we\u2019ve been working very hard for the last five years now, is they differ in the kind of application support and some of the system architectural aspects of these products. That\u2019s where we have waited very carefully into these vertical markets only after penetrating them with relatively low complexity components and then we\u2019d sell up chain integrating with our customers, embed with our customers.", "So it\u2019s quite a bit different. When you talk about baseband and software, that was a digital CMOS process. Going after customers in the software domain, competing with mega companies, many of them have their own FAB\u2019s and a great deal of scale in digital signal processing. That was not a business that we over time thought we could add enough value to provide sustainable shareholder returns, so we did what we felt it was smart. We analyzed the portfolio. We exited. We doubled down in areas of strength.", "So I think it\u2019s a good question, Cody, but I don\u2019t think its apples-to-apples when you compare the distraction in cellular base station. Now when you talk about cellular baseband, when you talk about transceivers, transceiver was just a product market segment that customers weren\u2019t willing to pay for. ", "So we were quite good at transceivers. The margins in that business were not commensurate with where we want the take the business. So, while there was revenue upside to it, we didn\u2019t see margin enhancement and therefore likewise, we exited that business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "A couple of questions. I know you touched on this earlier, but I want to dig in a little bit more. There has been a lot of conjecture, I guess, about Nokia and your product mix. I know year or so ago, you are hoping for a little bit higher revenue. The program that are pushed out there are specifically the Broadcom Voyager one and I know it\u2019s in the high single digits now. What is your guidance for the end of the year? Do you think you\u2019ll break through 10% and you\u2019ll continue to grow?", "To the extent, you can\u2019t talk about it or you are shipping to the Voyager platform at Nokia at this point. I\u2019m just trying to get a feel. You are so small there in such a big area, and Nokia even mentioned they want to move away from more to their yen-based cost. So [Inaudible] is out and you guys will be a natural substitute for that. So I\u2019m just trying to get for how big reasonably you think they could be this year and what the ramp would look like?", "Liam Griffin", "Well, as you know, Nokia is absolutely strategic to Skyworks and we have done much of the difficult work in being an approved supplier. We have a strong position in 3G and in EDGE, and we are in the two strategic EDGE-only platforms, one is a Broadcom platform and second is an Infineon platform.", "Nokia has absolute plans and so do we. We have to Skyworks be a significant player and a large share player. We certainly expect to get way beyond the 10% level in 2010. We also expect in 2010 to broadly expand our position and to deliver product across all segments from the low-end all the way to the highest end 3G and smart phone within Nokia.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Today, we are in less than 10% of their phones. That\u2019s where we entered their business on the WCDMA sector. We\u2019ve got design wins and production ramping in some cases and EDGE. We\u2019re moving into GPRSs. As Liam described, our goal is nothing. They have three qualified PA suppliers. That means we should get at least a third of their business and I am confident that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to get.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Just to refresh, you are in a hub system with Nokia?", "Dave Aldrich", "", "Yes, correct.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Steve Ferranti - Stephens Inc.", "Steve Ferranti - Stephens Inc.", "I think, Dave, you had touched upon consolidation in the Gallium Arsenide space a little earlier. I wanted to see if you could provide your thoughts on where we are in that consolidation, particularly with some of the, I guess, non-public players? Do you think that there is still some consolidation to go or is that a theme that\u2019s largely played out by this point?", "Dave Aldrich", "I think the consolidation, the big wave of consolidation has been away from more discrete base solutions. If you think about an EDGE device, we ship today for say $2.50, it\u2019s a quad band, and has a multi-throw switch, has some fairly sophisticated control logic integrated in that credit module. It replaced even on current reference designs frankly. It was pulled by the customers not by the reference designs, because of its small footprint, its efficiency, and its ease of integration.", "The same thing happened in GPRS, where in the whole adoption of front-end modules versus discrete PAs [ph]. So the big share loss occurred, folks who make a discrete filter or a discrete switch or RLCs, and so on. That just the market moved away from that and it continues to do so. The next wave of share consolidation will occur if you would crack open many multi-mode phones today, they are still pretty complicated on that transmission.", "There are still discrete filters, there are lots of single band wideband CDMA peppered throughout those designs, so if you have a world phone you have got five bands, it is not common to have five PAs. ", "The next generation is going be, picture this, if you can put a multi-throw switch in your EDGE device, why not facilitate all the switching in control and handle all the logic in one chip if you will or at one solution and then began to consolidate and integrate those discrete bands in wideband CDMA. ", "That will be the next generation of consolidation where around system, of transmit systems that will have elements of switching, element of filtering, element of control, a lot of logic and broad based linear power amplifiers. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working with our customers now on that will be 2011, late-2010, 2011, 2012 and that trend won\u2019t stop.", "Steve Ferranti - Stephens Inc.", "You guys got a great cutover. We just wanted to touch quickly upon the six-inch transition. Maybe an update on sort of where we are there when you expect that capacity to start coming online and you know is it a flash cut, it\u2019s a gradual transition, some sort of sense for you know how that plays out? ", "Don Palette", "Hi Steve. This is Don. The full cutover was fully up and operational is middle of next year. We are producing wafers on that line right now so it\u2019s a gradual cutover. During this time, and during the whole time of the project, it has had no significant impact on margin. That will continue until the cutover occurs, but it is an important part of the strategy and it\u2019s a level that we\u2019re going to use to continue to move margins forward as that line comes on and it\u2019s fully utilized.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn it back to the presenters for any additional or closing remarks.", "Dave Aldrich", "Okay, well thank you everyone for participating in the call today and on behalf of the entire Skyworks team, we look forward to seeing you in upcoming conferences and take care.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

Mr. Schiller, please go ahead, sir.", "Tom Schiller", "Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks\u2019 fourth fiscal quarter 2009 conference call. ", "Joining me are Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Palette, our Chief Financial Officer, and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Dave will begin today\u2019s call with a business overview followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook.

I\u2019m pleased to report that the Skyworks posted solid results in the September quarter, outperforming our addressed markets and delivering strong top and bottom line sequential growth while further strengthening our balance sheet. ", "Specifically in the quarter, we delivered revenue of $228 million and that\u2019s up 19% sequentially. We expanded our gross margins to 41%. We improved operating income to nearly 19% and we posted $0.24 of earnings per share and that\u2019s up 50% sequentially and frankly a new company record. ", "With respect to cash, we generated $70 million of cash flow from operations. We retired another $17 million of our 2010 convertible debt and we exited the quarter with $370 million of cash.", "Finally, we guided up 13-15% in the December quarter on a year-over-year basis with a 20% operating margin and a $1.00 of earnings per share annualized run rate.", "At a higher level, we\u2019re benefiting from a few key strategic market trends and I\u2019d like to walk through them briefly.", "First, the rapid growth of the mobile internet and increasing demand for always on connectivity. Particularly given the ubiquity of social networking applications and the proliferation of Smartphone of notebooks, net books, and embedded wireless devices.", "Second, the global migration to innovative smart grid and energy management solutions, as utilities and consumers seek to more efficiently utilize and manage gas, water, and electricity usage and optimize grid performance.", "Third, the emergence of a host of analog intensive applications spanning high definition television, automotive, CATV, wireless and wire line infrastructure, medical, military and industrial markets. At the same time, we\u2019re continuing to make substantial progress along each of our strategic objectives and we\u2019ve been speaking with you about these for many quarters now.", "Our objectives are to gain share in our targeted markets. Our objectives are to diversify our business through increased traction in adjacent analog markets. Finally, to execute operationally in order to deliver ongoing gross and operating margin improvement, as well as higher returns on invested capital. ", "With regard to gaining market share and as we hope our results demonstrate, Skyworks is outperforming across the mobile internet spectrum from notebooks and data cards to Smartphone to entry level devices. ", "On the high end, Skyworks is uniquely now supporting all top five top tier handset OEMs in all key Smartphone suppliers with a disproportionate share of the latter growth segment. In fact, according to Oppenheimer, the Smartphone category is expected to grow 21% in 2009 and reach 185 million units this year. In that growth, it\u2019s expected to accelerate to 326 million units by 2011 and that\u2019s a 33% compounded growth rate.", "I recall that these devices drive substantially more semiconductor dollar content as compared with traditional 2G and even 3G handsets. ", "Social networking sites like Facebook, like MySpace, and Twitter are further fueling consumers\u2019 demands for broadband network access to share streaming audio, video, and picture content. ", "Perhaps most importantly, the Smartphone food chain, that is the food chain is highly successful with service providers such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, deriving highly profitable revenue streams from data services and other embedded wireless devices, Even during the darkest days of het recession. Their strategy is quite simple \u2013 place application-rich Smartphone in the hands of the consumer and both parties benefit. Consumer satisfy their thirst for real time mobile internet access, while carriers gain from ever-increasing RPU levels. As a result, the OEMs, our customers providing the hardware, derive increased value from their devices, which of course we populate with our solution. ", "Now at the same time, we\u2019re diversifying into new markets, the second element of our strategy. For example, we\u2019re now participating on the infrastructure side of the mobile internet phenomenon as well. Here we\u2019re now supporting the key market leaders like Cisco, Erikson, Wawa, ZTE, Alcatel Lucent, with our growing family of networking solutions.", "According to mobile network analysts from Informa, mobile data traffic volumes are set to ride 25 fold, 25 fold from current levels by the year 2012. As a result, mobile operators need to begin to install new bay station routers, back hall network equipment. Starting now, to avoid network traffic jams in the future, and ultimately to preserve their highly profitable data service revenue. ", "Clearly over the long haul, there will need to be upgrades and expansion to existing infrastructure requiring increase in analog and mixed signal content. ", "To that end, during the quarter, we\u2019ve introduced a wide range of wire line and wireless networking and bay station solutions with several new higher margin products under development and entering our pipeline. ", "We\u2019re particularly excited about our strategic growth potential within smart grid applications. This is another targeted vertical market for Skyworks. ", "To frame our market opportunity here, consider that there are 2.7 billion meters worldwide. 2.7 billion, according to IMS Research, of which only 8% are automated today. Accordingly, we see a massive retro fit in deployment opportunity as utilities seek to more efficiently manage their grid to the name of lower administration costs and of course high return on investment. ", "Like the internet itself, smart grids are complex, multi-layered network of networks, and are increasingly interactive. This market landscape is made up of a wide variety of components, applications like sensors and controls, enabling us to leverage several key RF building blocks across a broad eco system of energy management suppliers. For us, these include I-Tron, Esco, Neptune, Landerson Gear, and Census. ", "In support of products ranging from handheld meters, meter readers, to smart meters, to home automation systems, and in the latter case, home automation systems, we\u2019re supporting both the access point in various nodes throughout the home like thermostats, air conditioners, and appliances via our Zigbee solutions. ", "Of special note I think, just last week, the administration committed $3.4 billion of stimulus money for 100 smart grid projects in 49 states. As part of the funding, utilities are contributing another $4.7 billion to the projects, pushing total spending to $8.1 billion dollars. ", "Our focus on this particular market segment began a few years ago and it sprang from our analog catalog business as customers sought custom management solutions from us.", "Okay, finally the third element of our strategy, is to continue to execute operationally. This aspect of our strategy has become even more or became even more important as we entered the economic downturn. In fact, our fab light manufacturing approach and our leaner cost structure allowed Skyworks to post record operating income in 2009 of $125 million and operating margins of just greater than 15%, even in the context of this market.", "I think perhaps most importantly we\u2019re able to generate $210 million in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009. This during the worst industry down cycle in recent memory. ", "I believe our performance against this challenging backdrop speaks to the resolve of the Skywork\u2019s team and frankly the strength of our business model.", "Now of special note, we are guiding to a 20% operating margin in the current quarter, in the December quarter. In longer range, we now see a path to operating margins in the mid-20\u2019s and Don will comment on that further in a moment. ", "So at a higher level, we are transforming Skyworks and are committed to creating a company that can rival some of the best analog franchises in terms of growth, in terms of diversification, in terms of profitability and cash generation. Perhaps most importantly, we\u2019re entering this new and exciting phase with a very rich product pipeline, a broad sales channel, and demonstrated operational agility. All this towards creating shareholder value. ", "I\u2019ll now turn this call over to Don for his review.", "Donald Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining us, everyone. ", "I\u2019ll first provide a quick summary of our fourth fiscal quarter results, then provide our business outlook, including an update on our projected tax rate. Finally, I\u2019ll outline our new long-term operating margin target.", "First to our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the period was $228.1 million, up 19% sequentially, and exceeding our updated revenue guidance range of $220 to $225 million provided in September.", "Gross profit was $93.4 million or 40.9% of revenue, 40 basis points sequential expansion and that was driven by continued factory process and productivity enhancements, product and yield improvements, and finally double digit year-over-year material cost reductions.", "Operating expenses were $50.9 million, of which R&D was $29.3 million and SG&A was $21.6 million, yielding 42.5 million of operating income, and a 18.6% operating margin. ", "Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was $410,000 of expense, while taxes were $255,000. Note, both our other expense and cash taxes were favorably impacted by one time cash benefits equating to one penny of earnings per share in total. Incidentally, you\u2019ll note that based on the strength of our 2009 financial performance and our earnings outlook, we reversed approximately $30 million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and our GAAP income statement with no benefit to our non-GAAP results. ", " As a result, our GAAP net income was $56 billion, or $0.32 of diluted earnings per share, while our non-GAAP income was $41.8 million or $0.24 of diluted earnings per share, a new company record. ", "Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $370 million, a $62 million sequential improvement in our cash balance even after the retirement of $17 million of 2010 convertible debt. ", "During the quarter, we $70 million in cash flow from operations, we recorded $20 million of depreciation and we invested $15 million in capital expenditures.", "Now to our business outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010. Although we continue to remain cautious on the broader economy, based on our improving order visibility and backlog strength, we anticipate 13 to 15% year-over-year revenue growth driven by mobile internet, energy management, and diversified analog applications, as Dave mentioned earlier.", "Assuming $240 million in revenue, we plan to expand gross margin to the 41.5 to 42% range with operating expenses of roughly $51.5 million enabling us to deliver a 20% operating margin. ", "Below the line, we anticipate $700,000 in expense for net interest and other expense. As for taxes, recall we previously guided to a 15% cash tax rate beginning in fiscal 2010, but with the implementation of tax initiatives in the first half of 2010 and the use of our remaining R&D tax credits, we are reducing our estimated fiscal 2010 cash rate to approximately 8%. ", "In turn, you can expect Skyworks to achieve $1 per share annualized run rate off of a base of 179 million shares beginning this quarter and with further improvements planned as we progress into physical 2010. ", "In fact, since we are on track to achieve our financial model, today we are outlining a new operating margin target for Skyworks. Given our top line growth plans, scale, product gross margin improvements, and operating expense leverage, we now have a path to operating margins in the mid-20\u2019s. We believe this longer term model is highly achievable and strikes the right balance between gaining market share, enhancing margins, and most importantly maximizing free cash flow dollars.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let\u2019s open the lines up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Uche Orji - UBS.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "", "First question is about your long-term margin. Just wondering, in a sense, what is the gross margin expectation and how much revenue growth you would need for this and also if you have any timeline in mind to achieve this target.", "Donald Palette", "", "As we have articulated over the past year or so, our previous targeted model of $240 million in quarterly revenue that we were going to be at 42% gross margin and 20% operating margin. As our Q1 guidance indicates, we\u2019re expecting to achieve these targets this quarter. So given our future product mix, new markets, and the value of our new products, we see a path to the mid-20\u2019s for operating margin. ", "This expansion is going to be a combination of both gross margin expansion and leveraging our operating expense base, but right now we\u2019re just not providing the detailed elements today, but we certainly will over time. ", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "", "Secondly, who was the ten percent customers was this quarter and who was your largest customer?", "Dave Aldrich", "", "Sure, we had two ten percent customers this quarter. We had Samsung, Sony, Erikson. Just want to note that LG and Motorola, all those were in the high single digits for the quarter, with Samsung being the top customer for the quarter. ", "", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co.", "First a household question, Don. You retired some of the debt. How should we think about the share count evolving here? I don\u2019t know if the convert is in the outstanding shares count here or not. Second, with regards to your mid-20\u2019s. I understand it\u2019s a long term, but does that require fundamental change in mix between your linear and sale, that on the current mix just by continuing to drive your leverage you can get there or is it really a product mix that needs to change? ", "Donald Palette", "", "I\u2019ll address the first question. We guided $179 in Q1. As far as the converts, the debt that is outstanding through any of the quarter ends we\u2019ve just gone through, there already is dilution for some of those converts space in the fact that they have been in the money. ", "On a go-forward basis, they have cash settlement options. So we have the option of when the debt matures, we have this first maturing March 1 to either settle an equity or pay in cash. Our intention is to pay it in cash. So I wouldn\u2019t expect any future dilution.", "Dave Aldrich", "", "With respect to the long-term model that Don outlined, I\u2019d really call it frankly more of a mid-term model. If you go back and look at historically with Skyworks, as we\u2019ve increased our revenue, we\u2019ve had a pretty consistent model where we\u2019ve dropped through a fairly healthy percentage of that increase in revenue to the bottom line. It\u2019s been a combination of gross margin and operating income expansion. ", "So that\u2019s really what we see. It is not a fundamental shift in the overall business, but it does take advantage of some of the newer products and new markets and the degree of diversification we\u2019re now having as we enter 2010 and the associated high contribution margin those products bring, but they\u2019re identified programs. ", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Follow-up question regarding your meter of business. Maybe, Don, you can just qualify a ballpark standpoint, how much was that this past quarter and what is the run rate you think you can get to exiting next fiscal year?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, Ittai. This is Liam. Well that business, as you know, is really in the early stages and we believe to be a meaningful and long-term growth cycle. We were up sequentially in September. We\u2019ll be up even more in the current quarter, the December quarter. Right now it\u2019s the fastest growing segment of our analog mix signal business and roughly about 15% of that portfolio. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Ferranti - Stephens Inc.", "Steve Ferranti - Stephens Inc.", "I\u2019m wondering if you guys could give us your sense of what inventory looks like out there these days. Certainly been some anecdotes of some pockets of inventory and some corrections going on. I\u2019m wondering if you could describe to us what you\u2019re seeing. ", "Dave Aldrich", "", "Our visibility has improved somewhat, I\u2019ll say, from where it was certainly three to six months ago. Our market, to stabilize, and inventory is normalizing after there was some restocking that occurred again here in the last six months. So clearly there are pockets of concern. This market, as you know, is a bit choppy. I will say this, that when we provide our guidance and our commentary in the prepared remarks is that we\u2019re really discussing very well defined and specific program ramps and it\u2019s helping to somewhat insulate us from some of the volatility that you\u2019ve seen out there. ", "In any event, we do see choppiness, but we also are fortunate to have the clearly defined ramps. ", "Steve Ferranti - Stephens Inc.", "", "A quick follow-up for me. Can you tell us what percentage book you are to the mid-point of your guidance? ", "Dave Aldrich", "", "In an attempt to be conservative, we\u2019re fully booked to the guidance. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "I\u2019ll follow up on Steve\u2019s question there. In terms of where you see some pockets of inventory, can you describe that on a geographical basis?", "Dave Aldrich", "", "As I said, clearly there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about Korea and one company in particular, a customer of ours, but I must say that\u2019s where the concern has been. That\u2019s been registered with us, we think over the last quarter, but I think in that case we\u2019re really quite fortunate we have some base partnerships there that are allowing us to take some share, both in the case of Wideband CDMA and Edge and GPRS where we have a strong position. ", "So we haven\u2019t been subjected to the same level of volatility as apparently others have experienced. Having said that, we\u2019re modeling that customer even with these ramps to be flat to modestly up in the December quarter. ", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "In terms of the mix to try to get to the mid-20 type of operating margins, does it require your linear business to become a bigger percentage of total revenue? ", "Donald Palette", "", "When we built this model, just like we did the previous model, we never assumed any shift in the mix between our diversified analog business and our handset business and you can assume that going forward. That is the way we\u2019re looking at the model. So any change in that mix is going to be upside for us. ", "Dave Aldrich", "", "This isn\u2019t, the handset business that you might have thought about one, two, certainly one year ago. Even within our handset business, we have some really margin-rich and very complicated sole sores, mostly custom devices in design. So when we talk about Smartphone, when we talk about some of these really sophisticated mobile internet devices and various form factors, the dollar content is higher but so are the contribution dollars. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Shannon - Northland Securities", "Richard Shannon - Northland Securities", "My question regards around expected ASP declines for next year versus how they trended in 2009 thus far and specifically on 3G. Any change in that expected pricing curve?", "Dave Aldrich", "", "Certainly 2009, given the recessionary environment, particularly the front half of the year was difficult from an ASP perspective. We see now pricing stabilizing now with inventory being rebalanced and overall market conditions improving slightly. ", "Going into 2010, I think we\u2019re going to do pretty well with respect to ASPs. It will be less erosion for us in our current model. Some of that comes from diversified analog, which tends to have a much better ASP profile and also significant ramps in 3G. We\u2019re in very good position with respect to price and we should be coming out of that quite strong.", "Richard Shannon - Northland Securities", "My follow-up question is on your transition to six inch substrate manufacturing. Do you have any update on the timing when you expect that to switch over and what kind of an impact would that have on your outside foundry partners. Do you expect to take relatively more away from them as you do so or is there going to be some sort of balance in there?", "Donald Palette", "", "We have been producing both four inch and six inch wafers over the past several quarters as we are ramping the new six inch line. Our full cutover plans for approximately mid-year. This year there\u2019s been no drag on the margins during that time and when it\u2019s fully up and running the second half the year, we do expect some of that margin expansion as a result of that. ", "As far as our wafer, the foundries providing us a wafer supply, that\u2019s a critical part of our overall manufacturing strategy. It\u2019s a redundant source of supply for us, it\u2019s critical. They\u2019re going to continue to produce some volume and as we ramp the overall business, there\u2019s going to be the right kind of mix to drive the margin enhancement as we go forward.

We have seen in general performance out of the 8-pack market. So particularly China, also Korea, and some of our partners in China specifically MediaT support not only local markets, but also some emerging economies in India, Africa, Southeast Asia. So we have seen some strength there. ", "When we look at the December quarter, we\u2019ve modeled those markets to be very conservative and not a significant part of the growth this quarter, but we still consider them meaningful for 2010.", "Donald Palette", "", "I think with respect to energy management, some of the diversified non-handset businesses, we are seeing strength in N.A. and U.S. ", "Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital", "March visibility.

The cash generation this quarter was very strong and I just wondered as you build up cash, what is the minimum level that you need to keep on hand and once you\u2019ve paid off the debt, what are some of the uses of cash that you\u2019re thinking?", "Donald Palette", "", "We have done a very good job over the past year and a half and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. If we step back and you look at our working capital fluctuations and to be somewhat conservative, you know, we view that in the somewhere in the $125 to maybe $140 million range with the way the business is structured today. That\u2019s kind of our baseline cash. ", "Keep in mind, we have retired $120 million of the debt over the last 12 months. We have, after buying back $17 million of the $50 million that\u2019s due March 1. So coming up in March 1, we have another $33 million that we\u2019re going to pay and at that point we are going to have a healthy cash reserve balance to entertain options of whether we go out and buy additional debt, whether we buy back stock, or any other kind of critical investments that we might see appropriate.

We\u2019ve got some really good designs IP and the team while small is integrating nicely with the rest of Skyworks. ", "The revenue has been relatively small, but I think as we add that IP to our arsenal, we\u2019re really able to create some new designs that are pretty slick and we\u2019ve been able to address some customers. There is a customer set that is addressing segments of the ultra low-end market that they\u2019re really not attractive to us, that now our margin requirements, we\u2019re able to address that.

Could that potentially happen like a 20-10 event where you start to see a shift toward that or do you expect that to be further out?", "Dave Aldrich", "", "The shift is getting a little bit blurred, because when we talk about the mobile internet for example, those are quite a diversified suite of product. They\u2019re high dollar content. In most cases, they\u2019re high margin. And so, it\u2019s not your grandfather\u2019s PA, for example. So it\u2019s a little bit blurred. We haven\u2019t anticipated any major shifts as we provide this guidance. There are certainly opportunities for us to move what has been kind of a catalog-standard business that\u2019s now being augmented by some we think some pretty exciting verticals like smart energy, smart grid. So we think there\u2019s an opportunity to grow it faster than the handset , but with this mobile internet phenomena and the much higher dollar content we\u2019re achieving in smart phones and some of these other devices, these two businesses are expected at least in terms of our modeling to grow in relative lock step with one another.

So as a result, we really are striving to be less dependent on any one OEM and so as we\u2019ve seen pretty massive share shifts in the emergence of the Smartphone sector, for example, we\u2019ve been able to ride through that, because we don\u2019t have the kind of concentration that I think many have experienced in this industry in the past.

At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Laura Aregas, Corporate Communications who is filling in for Tom Schiller.", "Laura Aregas", "", "Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks first fiscal quarter 2010 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Palette, our Chief Financial Officer and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing.", "Dave will begin today\u2019s call with a business overview followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the investor relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "I will now turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David Aldrich", "Welcome everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report that 2010 is off to a solid start at Skyworks. In our first quarter of the fiscal year we delivered strong top and bottom line growth on both the sequential and a year over year basis, and at a higher level we believe these results are demonstrating our ongoing transformation to a high margin and a highly diversified analog company.", "Specifically in the first quarter we delivered revenue of $245 million. That\u2019s up 17% sequentially year over year. We expanded our gross margins to 42.2%. We improved our year over year operating income by 83%, and we achieved a 21.3% operating margin and posted $0.27 of EPS. This is $0.02 better than our guidance.", "With respect to cash, we generated $53 million of cash flow from operations and we exited the quarter with $402 million of cash. Looking forward, we are guiding to a 30% year over year revenue growth in the seasonally low March quarter and we\u2019re well positioned for accelerating EPS growth during the fiscal year.", "As we believe our results and outlook reflect, we are capitalizing on several key market drivers today. First is the exploding demand for mobile internet applications and always on connectivity, particularly given the increasing ubiquity of social networking, enterprise access, music and video applications.", "And this in turn is driving the broad proliferation of smart phones, net books, note books, caplets and other forms of embedded wireless devices. ", "The second market trend is the increasing demand for custom analog solutions supporting a number of applications across a variety of non hand set markets including automotive, avionics, including wireless and wire line infrastructure, satellite, medical, military, industrial.", "And the third market trend is the rapid adoption of smart grid technologies as utilities and consumers alike seek to more efficiently measure and to manage their energy utilization.", "Now moving from these market tailwinds to Skyworks, strategically we continue to make substantial progress along each of the three core strategies we\u2019ve shared with you over the last few years; namely, first to gain share in our targeted markets, second to diversify our business in increase traction in adjacent analog markets and third, to execute operationally to deliver ongoing margin expansion and higher returns on investment.", "With regards to gaining market share, Skyworks continues to consolidate share across the mobile internet spectrum. This covers everything from net books and data cards to smart phones and even entry level hand sets.", "On the high end, Skyworks is uniquely today supporting all five top tier hand set OEM\u2019s and all key smart phone suppliers. I think a special note, I think last quarter we added several new android based platforms including Google\u2019s recently launched Nexus One mobile phone.", "As we\u2019ve discussed on many investor calls, this segment in particular has been a focal point for us given that we capture up to $8.00 per device and our technology addresses both system complexity and stringent performance requirements.", "With network rolling and maximum carrier flexibility in mind, we see a growing trend towards more band and as a result increasing addressable semiconductor content per platform.", "I think furthermore, we\u2019re seeing a very successful smart phone food chain with service providers like AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Vota Phone deriving highly profitable revenue streams from data service contracts and other embedded wireless devices.", "I think their strategy is very simple. Place application rich smart phones in the hands of the consumer and both parties benefit. Consumers satisfy their demand for real time mobile internet access while carriers gain from ever increasing ARPU levels.", "According to Piper Jaffray, an equity research firm, global smart phone sales will increase from around 139 million units in 2008 to nearly 400 million units in 2011 and presents a 42% compounded annual growth rate.", "So let me reiterate why we\u2019re performing in the smart phone category and why we believe we will be the leading front end supplier in this segment. First, we\u2019re able to meet our customer\u2019s demand for size and cost. We deliver highly integrative solutions at both the chip and at the module level saving precious board space on ever shrinking form factors.", "In addition, we leverage our in house building blocks in scale to produce cost effective solutions that help decrease the hand set manufacturers overall billable material costs. ", "Secondly, our deep understanding of system level requirements allows us to develop architectures with best in class specification that enhance the performance of our customer\u2019s end solutions. ", "In essence, since the very inception of Skyworks, we approach opportunities from a complete solutions perspective when engaging with our customers and chip set partners and rather than looking at it from a single device, or from a single component perspective, and this is why Skyworks was created way back in 2002.", "At the same time, we\u2019re diversifying into new markets, the second element of our strategy. For example, during the quarter we secured a strategic design win with Wawway that leverages our custom amplifiers, mixers and discrete in a very highly integrated subsystem in support of their 3D Bay Station applications.", "In addition, we commenced volume production of 5 gigahertz low noise amplifiers targeting a diverse set of end markets. We launched a family of highly integrated CMOS switches with high isolation capability for the direct broadcast satellite market.", "We successfully ramped analog control devised for Intel\u2019s wireless local area networking applications, and we extended our ISO TX 16949 automotive certification which allows us to further penetrate new markets.", "In addition, we have over the past couple of years made targeted investments in order to position ourselves very early to capture share in the smart grid market. By virtue of our very recent design wins, today Skyworks is servicing several multi-year advanced metering infrastructure contracts supporting a variety of U.S. and international utilities.", "Some of these include Southern California Edison, Center Point Energy, National Grid, the Southern Company, BTE Energy, San Diego Gas and Electric and British Gas. ", "Of special note during the quarter we commenced volume production on several devices supporting Itron\u2019s Open Way energy management solutions which provide outage and fault monitoring, surge protection, real time pricing and usage information.", "At a higher level, our approach to these targeted vertical applications is to service the needs where the focus is on portability, mobility, current consumption or signal and data integrity. These are the challenges our linear technology is ideally suited to solve.", "Finally, the third element of our strategy is to execute operationally. Our progress on this front I think is best exemplified by our first quarter\u2019s performance with operating margin of 21.3%. Don will discuss this in more details and discuss the specifics regarding our medium term plans to drive the business into the mid 20\u2019s operating margin range.", "In summary, we\u2019re transforming Skyworks. We\u2019re creating a company that can rival some of the best analog stalwarts in terms of growth, diversification, profitability and cash generation. Perhaps most importantly, we\u2019re entering this new and exciting phase with a rich product pipeline, a broad sales channel and demonstrated operational agility, all positioning us to create greater competitive advantages and to continue to create shareholder value.", "I\u2019ll not turn this over to Don for his comments.", "Donald Palette", "Thanks for joining us everyone. We appreciate that. First I will provide you with a quick summary of our first fiscal quarter results and then we\u2019ll discuss our business outlook.", "Revenue for the period was $245.1 million, up 17% year over year and surpassing our guidance range of $238 million to $242 million. Gross profit was $103.5 million or 42.2% of revenue, a 130 basis point sequential expansion which was driven by a richly diversified product mix, volume ramp of margin accretive new products, continued factory process and productivity enhancements, product and end yield improvements and double digit year over year material cost reductions.", "Operating expenses were $51.3 million of which R&D was $30 million and SG&A was $21.3 million, yielding $52.3 million of operating income and a 21.3% operating margin. ", "Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was $700,000 expense while taxes were $3.9 million. As a result, our net income was $47.7 million or $0.27 of diluted earnings per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $402 million. During the quarter we generated $53 million in cash flow from operations. We recorded $11 million of depreciation, retired $5 million of convertible debt and invested $15 million in capital expenditures.", "Now, to our business outlook; based on broad based business strengths and new applications, we anticipate 30% year over year revenue growth for the second fiscal quarter. Specifically, we expect revenue of $225 million, significantly better than normal seasonality for the March quarter; gross margin between 41% and 41.5%, operating expenses of approximately $52 million, $700,000 of other expense and an 8% cash tax rate.", "In turn, assuming 182 million fully diluted shares, we are forecasting diluted earnings per share of $0.21 which represents a 75% year over year improvement in bottom line profitability.", "Now let me take a moment to discuss our medium term financial targets. Given our top line growth plans, scale, product gross margin improvements, and operating expense leverage, we now have a path to operating margins in the mid 20\u2019s on revenues in the range of $280 million to $300 million.", "To help define the key elements of this revised model, we anticipate that approximately 4$0.45 to $0.50 of incremental revenue will drop through the gross and operating margins with the balance of the model return improvements deriving from operating expense leverage.", "We believe this model is highly achievable and strikes the right balance between gaining market share, enhancing margins and most importantly, maximizing our return on invested capital. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks and so operator you can open the lines up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Attai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Attai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Congratulations on a good quarter. I wanted to drill a little bit into your guidance. Last time you gave a model target. You achieved it in the year that you provided that guidance. Should we make the same assumption on your most current operating margin guidance target?", "Donald Palette", "We\u2019re obviously not guiding beyond current quarter but I think the way to think of it is this is a highly medium term model and we look at 2010 as having all the significant growth potential. Our serve markets are growing and we believe we\u2019re well positioned to win share.", "Attai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Share gains have been a big part of the story over the past year. Clearly you\u2019ve made a lot of great progress in that area. I guess the question is, where do you feel you stand right now with regards to more opportunities like this. You\u2019ve gained a lot. Where else is there for you to go and if you can be a little bit more specific on that front, I\u2019m just trying to get a better gauge whether your growth this year is just a little bit more weighted towards TAM expansion rather than share gains as a driver.", "David Aldrich", "That\u2019s a broad question. We see opportunities in 3G where in some segments we\u2019re under weighted and our newest solutions and reference design partnerships are allowing us to gain traction. We think about Korea for example. We also with respect to Nokia are moving from the high end into their mid term mainstream market as we speak. I think that\u2019s an important driver for us.", "We\u2019re gaining more content where the smart phone architectures are moving toward to less discrete front end and more integrated if you will front end solutions where we are moving in a pretty fast rate from servicing a portion of that front end to more and more and ultimately all in many platforms. So we\u2019re going to take share in smart phone.", "I think in terms of the secular trend, the hand set market is going to grow in the 8% to 10% range on a compounded basis. Our addressable market as there are more smart phones, more 3G, more bands, more filtering and switching complexity, at an 8% to 10% unit growth rate, our serviceable portion of that market is growing at roughly double that as we calculate it.", "So we believe we are addressing a market that\u2019s growing in the 17% component growth rate where we can move our share dial pretty significantly in the areas I described.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Uche Orji \u2013 UBS.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "I just wanted to drill down on your guidance for the March quarter. How much of that March quarter revenue number is fueled by the backlog and also I see that your inventory has gone up significantly, so just wondering if this inventory is building in anticipation of higher revenue or how do you explain that?", "David Aldrich", "The question as to  how booked we are, if we take our current firm backlog and the forecast from our hub customers, we\u2019re over 90% booked which is a good place for us to be in on this guidance, so we\u2019re very comfortable the guidance is conservative.", "With respect to inventory, Don perhaps you could answer that.", "Donald Palette", "The inventory actually was up at the end of this quarter $12 million from the prior quarter and what you\u2019re seeing there is it\u2019s all a function of customer requirement dates for shipments. We have a high percentage of those early in the quarter, higher than normal, so we\u2019ve got the inventory build that reflects that.", "The one thing to keep in mind, our velocity as far as turns, that\u2019s how we measure inventory velocity, was above six for Q1. So again the inventory turns are very healthy and it\u2019s really just a question of timing of customer demand. Nothing else.", "Uche Orji \u2013 UBS", "About your gross margin, if you could explain to me, as we go down from December to the March quarter, the difference in the gross margin is basically driven by revenue or is there any other factor that is leading to a lower gross margin in the March quarter?", "Donald Palette", "It\u2019s strictly volume. All manufacturing companies have a fixed component of costs and that big of a revenue change does drive some margin pressure. That\u2019s all you\u2019re seeing. Nothing else unusual at all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities", "A point of clarification here, I was wondering, you mentioned the 17% compounded annual growth rate potential for your addressable markets. I\u2019m assuming that this doesn\u2019t include your potential for share gains. Is that correct?", "David Aldrich", "That\u2019s correct. By the way, I need to point out that\u2019s just in the handset sector. We have our smart grid business is growing faster than that. We have linear product markets that are growing faster than that.", "The 17% is, all it\u2019s really doing is weighting the movement of the unit volume more toward 3G and smart phones where we have a higher addressable content and less towards 2G where the dollar content is lower. So I\u2019m simply weighting the average dollar content of what we can address in more complex products versus less complex products and that 17% assumes ASP erosion as well. So that\u2019s after ASP erosion.", "Alex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities", "And you touched on my follow on which is in regard to smart grid here. Pretty impressive array of engagements here. Can you give us an idea of the timetable for this, the magnitude and it seems like you\u2019re giving a little bit more visibility than most of your wireless peers. Do you feel like you\u2019ve got a first mover advantage in this market or share advantage at this point?", "Liam Griffin", "We did invest early in that sector as Dave outlined in the opening comments and we still believe that as much as we\u2019ve enabled some great design wins with a number of players, it\u2019s still very, very early in what we believe to be a multi-year cycle.", "So we\u2019re well positioned for this. There are a number of products that we are selling to a variety of customers. We take advantage of the DNA that we\u2019ve developed in mobile internet. We\u2019re selling discrete components, integrated components and we enjoy a very good position. But it\u2019s early, and we think there is quite a bit of growth ahead.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Stephen Ferranti \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Stephen Ferranti \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Just a follow up to the prior question, Liam you mentioned that we\u2019re early on in the smart grid opportunity playing out. Does the fact that you\u2019re talking about now commencing volume production; does that imply any sort of acceleration perhaps in the growth in calendar year \u201910?", "Liam Griffin", "Absolutely. In calendar year it will be a very good year for energy management business. The last several quarters have all been up sequentially. We will be up again in the March quarter. It\u2019s just a matter of timing in terms of how these ramps roll out, how these utilities adopt the technology.", "We\u2019re certainly trying to attract more and more end customers, but it will be a material growth driver for the non hand set portfolio in 2010.", "Stephen Ferranti \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Your guidance implies sequential decline of only 8% which is I believe is less than the historic norm. Do you think that is a reflection of the fact that you\u2019re picking up share or do you think that maybe the end markets are just down less than what\u2019s seasonally normal.", "David Aldrich", "We\u2019re assuming I guess one might say conservatively that the March seasonality will be down. It will be down normal levels which will be in the 10% to 15% range. Our guidance is better than that and we think we\u2019ve outlined pretty conservative guidelines in guidance based upon backlog position and based upon some known program ramps where we have very high visibility. We\u2019re ramping into production.", "It\u2019s based on the mix of our business that in the March quarter we get much less seasonality from our linear products business and in these targeted vertical applications as Liam mentioned. Smart grid won\u2019t be down in the March quarter. So I think it\u2019s a combination of all of those things.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equity Research.", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equity Research", "Your margin profile that you described here, sustaining these gross margins seems to be occurring even without a huge increase in your linear business or share gains in your linear business relative to the hand set side of it and it\u2019s always been the case that the margins on those gross margins are significantly better than your hand set margin. Is that still the case? Is linear still doing better than the handsets? And what can we expect over the next year or so? Should we expect to see that break above the 25% of revenue for the firm or is it going to grow because you\u2019re doing so well in the hand set side of the business, is it going to continue to be around the 20% mark? And if you could, tell us what it was this quarter.", "David Aldrich", "The model that Don described assumes that we have the same relative split between non hand set and hand set, linear products and hand sets. And while we have some, we talked about this a lot on calls in the past where at one time we had a growth in the hand set business expectation and we had sort of a catalog standard, particularly in the catalog business where we felt that while that was a great mix in terms of volatility and less volatility obviously and more profitability, we really wanted to step up our ability to go in very surgically with these targeted verticals and create fewer singles and more doubles and triples, to use a baseball analogy.", "We think we\u2019re finally, it takes a long time to do that. You have to build your marketing team, your applications knowledge so that you\u2019re not throwing spaghetti at the wall. We\u2019re getting much better. Our hit rate is improving. ", "So it\u2019s a long way of saying the model assumes a similar split. I\u2019m optimistic that over the medium term, over the long term in this company you\u2019re going to see us grow that business faster, but the model is not dependant on it.", "Donald Palette", "The hand sets were again in the mid to high 70% range just like you\u2019ve seen over the past year.", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equity Research", "There\u2019s been a lot of chatter about the mix shift for you from more of the low end stuff into China, maybe losing a little bit of share to competitors to taking a lot more share in the smart phone and that the larger hand set OEM. Doe that trend continue on the quarter? And then six inches, you\u2019ve moved to six inch fab in the spring I guess full on or ramping it. Will that have an impact on gross margin? Is that a big part of your gross margin story for the year or can you quantify that?", "Donald Palette", "The six inch is consistent with what we communicated in prior quarters but we\u2019ve been producing both four and six inch over the past several quarters as we\u2019re ramping the new line. The full cut over will be complete at the end of this quarter and certainly when it\u2019s fully utilized, it\u2019s an important lever for us to increase internal capacity and expand gross margin. So it is part of the equation, the new business model formula. We haven\u2019t quantified the exact impact and it will occur gradually over time as volume ramps.", "David Aldrich", "With respect to the China business, I\u2019m not really sure where the comment that we\u2019re losing share in China is coming from. We acquired Axiom a short time ago and that business is doing what we expected it to do. It\u2019s allowing us to address the ultra low end and that\u2019s going quite well.", "Our partnership with Media Tech is strong. We were very strong in the December quarter. And in addition, we\u2019re moving from fewer of the commoditized pans, a gas chip in a box, and more of our going forward solutions are going to be customized front end solutions. We think we\u2019re adding more of a differential advantage.", "So the shares move around. That market is sometimes difficult to get a bead on. There have been share shifts in that sector but we haven\u2019t been a net loser on that. Our share is very strong.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Suji De Silva \u2013 Kaufman Brothers.", "Suji De Silva \u2013 Kaufman Brothers", "I think you talked about some visibility to share gains in the coming quarter helping you over seasonality. Is that something you see continuing for the next few quarters or does it tail off at some point, that visibility from program ramps?", "David Aldrich", "It\u2019s doesn\u2019t tail off. It only tails off if your program ramps tail off and March is typically a slow quarter on the hand set side but the design activity I must say is just being driven through the roof. The number of new designs going through our characterization and qualification process, our AT, our sampling line is running 24/7.", "I think we doubled the number of new designs here in the last six to nine months versus the prior six to nine months. It\u2019s really eating up multi-mode if you will or multi-band complex front end solutions is driving a lot of these linear products; low noise amplifiers, some complicated linear products devices.", "So I think you should look for ongoing share consolidation within our hand set business simply because the complexity is becoming more and more difficult for component suppliers to address. You\u2019re seeing a few discrete switches, a few discrete PA\u2019s, fewer and fewer of them in favor of a system approach that allows for miniaturization that\u2019s shielded, high performance.  I think that trend will not stop and we expect to be a beneficiary of that.", "Suji De Silva \u2013 Kaufman Brothers", "Along those lines, it sounds like you have a scenario where you have big growth. Where is the mix of your revenues now 3G versus non 3G and how that\u2019s tracking.", "Donald Palette", "We were roughly 50% 2G, 50% 3G this quarter which is where we\u2019ve been over the past several quarters. That\u2019s dollars not units.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Shannon \u2013 Northland Securities.", "Richard Shannon \u2013 Northland Securities", "I have just one question on the topic of the Wi-Fi or wireless link. You referred to in your initial comments regarding your analog control devices with Intel\u2019s wireless land business. I\u2019m curious what kind of magnitude, what kind of a ramp we should see in that business. The second part of that question is what is your visibility into getting any sort of power amp wins with that particular customer and third, what\u2019s your viewpoint on Wi-Fi and the hand sets in 2010? Is that going to be a product area of interest for you?", "David Aldrich", "With respect to Wi-Fi in general, we actually are doing quite well in that space. We have a number of customers; some in the PC OEM market, net book market, also some chip set partners like Broadcom that we work with.", "The Intel business is actually notable for us because we are now in that account for the first time, so it\u2019s early engagement. There is a lot of blue sky within Intel. Today the business that we have is around CMOS switches for wireless land applications. We think there\u2019s clearly opportunity for us to bring that up with L&A\u2019s and power amplifiers and really gain some content.", "So first of all, we think the Wi-Fi space is really important for us. We\u2019ve had that business for awhile. Intel is new.", "With respect to the broader attachment in hand sets I\u2019m quite bullish on that. If you look at smart phones for example, virtually all of smart phones today carry Wi-Fi connectivity. We think attachments going into 2012, 2015 could be as much as 30% to 40% of the overall hand set market so it will be a big segment for wireless.", "Richard Shannon \u2013 Northland Securities", "Is Wi-Fi and hand sets even the material part of your business at this point or is this an account where it\u2019s very early on in that curve.", "David Aldrich", "It\u2019s actually most of our revenue in Wi-Fi today is in the laptop/net book space, but we have some customers who will be going into production on the hand set side by the middle of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "", "Can you just help us understand on the gross margin strength in the quarter, which of the factors that you identified were responsible for driving the upside to initial guidance?", "Donald Palette", "It was a combination of everything we discussed. It wasn\u2019t any one specific item. It\u2019s something we continue to focus on. We\u2019re very margin improvement focused. It\u2019s execution. Its product yield improvements. It\u2019s factory productivity. It\u2019s managing the cost base and it\u2019s volume upside. All those things contributed to the overall margin expansion. ", "One of the things that we believe gives us a cost advantage is the whole fab life model that we deploy and we continue to leverage that, and striking the right balance between internal and external capacity also gives us cost and margin improvements.", "David Aldrich", "We also see some of the programs we identified in our prepared comments many of these programs have higher contribution margins and ultimately result in higher gross margins. So we thing over time as we achieve this medium model we talked about, it will be partially because of all the things that Don said. We\u2019re also seeing a shift in our overall business towards more margin rich products over time.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "Just thinking about the first quarter, it seems like mix would become even more margin accretive for the company. Obviously volume is a headwind, but are there any other headwinds besides volume as we think about the first calendar quarter?", "Donald Palette", "No.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sanjay Devgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Sanjay Devgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I had a question following up on the path to the mid 20\u2019s operating margin that the $280 million to $300 million in revenue, is it fair to assume that at that rate gross margins will have to trend the mid 40\u2019s and if that\u2019s the case, is it more a case of volumes driving that since you\u2019ll be at the $280 million to $300 million or is it more a matter of the operational improvements from the four inch to six inch fab conversion?", "Donald Palette", "The way we position the model is we give you the ability to take the revenue changes and run them at these different contribution levels and get a feel for where the margins are. So yes, the margins will start tracking towards the mid 45. That\u2019s absolutely the case.", "And it\u2019s going to be driven by the volume. Increased volume is absolutely going to drive benefit. We\u2019ve got the new products Dave described, higher dollar content, some of these new linear product markets that we\u2019re serving and the six inch ramp, and also, just continually focusing on design for cost and operational efficiencies in the factories. All those things are going to contribute to expanding the margins.", "Sanjay Devgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "You mentioned the initial ramp into Itron\u2019s Open Way energy management module. As we look at remote metering or smart metering in general, as that business picks up this year and given the number of engagements you have, as a percentage of your revenue, how meaningful without getting too detailed, I guess if you just give some kind of qualitative insights, how meaningful do you think that business will be by the end of the year?", "David Aldrich", "As we mentioned earlier, today within our non hand set portfolio it is the largest growth driver in 2010. We think by mid year, end of the year, you\u2019ll be approaching potentially 20% of the non hand set business.", "From there it just really depends on how the company grows and how the rest of our linear businesses grow, but it will be a material driver. And we have good visibility. We have a suite of customers. Itron will be one of our more significant ones; also customers internationally.", "Then again, we\u2019ve got some great macro tailwinds; government stimulus money, energy conservationists all want to be part of it so I think there\u2019s good long term potential.", "Donald Palette", "As we talked about the early mover advantage, one of the things that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve created really specialized custom fairly integrated solutions. So the competition isn\u2019t so much with somebody doing what we\u2019re doing, but the competition is with a less efficient, more costly larger board space requirement with discrete design.", "So these are custom solutions and they just work and play better in these applications so there is a real differentiated product set here for us that will be difficult for the RF competitors to match.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Aalok Shaw \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Aalok Shaw \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Could you just remind me of who the 10% customers in this quarter?", "Donald Palette", "We had one 10% customer this quarter. It was Samsung. Several of the customers were in the high single digits as we\u2019ve seen in previous quarters but I think the important point to think of when you look at our results, we achieved $245 million in Q1 revenue and we did this with only one 10% customer.", "I really think the take away, that\u2019s just a real true testament to our overall diversification, how well we\u2019re executing on that strategy.", "Aalok Shaw \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Along those same lines, I know you talked about Nokia in the past and you\u2019ve mentioned it. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re a high percentage of revenue this quarter, but can you give us the status of where you think you are with Nokia and how we should be thinking about Nokia going through this year?", "David Aldrich", "Nokia of course represents great potential for Skyworks. We are engaged with that customer fully. Having said that, our revenues today are well below 10%. We think we have our sights and their sights set on material growth over the next several years. We\u2019re moving from 3G to Edge and eventually even some of their GPS platforms. So we feel very positive about that, but again we\u2019re nowhere near where our capabilities could lead us here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital.", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum Capital", "Inventory levels in the channel, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on that and are you seeing any pricing pressures? And for Don, your view on 2010 tax rates.", "David Aldrich", "Inventory right now looks actually quite balanced. There\u2019s always going to be a few pockets where maybe a distributor or some hub inventories floating around. We feel pretty good. Last quarter was very well balanced. Entering this quarter backlog looks pretty good so we don\u2019t see any trouble or any alarms with inventory.", "And pricing so far looks actually quite stable, so we\u2019re not alarmed by pricing and we\u2019re not concerned about that going into the new year.", "Donald Palette", "On the tax rate, we\u2019re looking at, and this is consistent with what we guided prior quarter is right now for 2010 we have about $90 million of NOL that we\u2019re going to be able to deploy this year. So that\u2019s providing us with an 8% cash tax rate.", "And we talked about an estimate for next year. I just want to give a little color on that. We\u2019ve got several key tax initiatives that we\u2019re working on as we speak. One of those will be deployed in the second half of the year, the other for fiscal 2011 and what that\u2019s going to allow us to do is we believe deliver a cash tax rate next year of roughly 12%.", "We\u2019ve got a lot of focus in this area and we think this is going to put us in a very competitive tax position.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Koffman \u2013 Raymond James.", "Todd Koffman \u2013 Raymond James", "You commented in your prepared remarks about the higher content in these new smart phones. You threw out the $8.00 number. Is there a trend within the new smart phone designs coming on the market to source all of the PA\u2019s from a single supplier or is it a mix and match so that if you call out a design win chances are somebody else has got the same design win as well.", "David Aldrich", "I think clearly what you\u2019re describing, the later half of what you just described has been the case because a lot of these newer smart phone, these entrance weren\u2019t phone manufacturers and they followed a pretty strict reference design approach and those references design approach had a lot of discrete content on them.", "If you notice some of the larger cellular OEM\u2019s are really driving more chip level and package level integration, and that over time in our experience has always tended to migrate toward more integration not less \u2013 always over time.", "I think these newer products and platforms we\u2019re seeing are working very closely not only with our smart phone OEM\u2019s but with our base band partners are becoming much higher levels of integration, much more thought early on in the development of the base band solution themselves, and much harder to extract a component from it.", "That\u2019s why my comment for example that there are a couple of suppliers who are always very big on selling discrete switches. I think those discrete switches will be incorporated into models either into a switch module or a front end PA transmit chain, and I think that\u2019s just a fact and it won\u2019t end.", "Now reference designs will have some mix and match approaches because they\u2019re obvious desire is to have continuity of supply and so on so there\u2019s kind of this pull from the customers to give them more integration and of course the base band folks want a competitive solution but they also don\u2019t want to be beholden to one component company and I understand that.", "So over time there will be a trend in one direction which is more integration, more winner takes all, more customization, fewer component opportunities for discrete providers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Tore Svanberg \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Just based on your March quarter guidance will your hand set business also be better than seasonal or is it more that that will be more in line with seasonality and the better results driven by linear and smart grid.", "David Aldrich", "We believe that the hand set business will be somewhat better than seasonality and we\u2019re basing that on backlog. So March quarter is always a seasonally down quarter and there\u2019s a lot of material that moves at the end of the December quarter so that kind of needs to be digested if you will and understood and in the channels we\u2019re in the process of doing that.", "But the assumption is that we would get less seasonality obviously in our linear products business and hand sets would be somewhat better than seasonal and of course we attempted to be quite conservative as we usually do with our guidance.", "Tore Svanberg \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "You mentioned a pretty important win for 3G infrastructure in China. Can you add some color there? Is that a market that you expect to do quite well in in 2010? I realize that it\u2019s the beginning ramp for you but help us understand a little bit more when we could potentially see some bigger ramps from that program in 2010.", "David Aldrich", "We absolutely believe that China infrastructure can be very important for us so we are seeing some traction with the TV companies. We think that they are net share gainers today globally and we have some very custom engines here that bring into account our mixers, synthesizers, products that are margin rich, highly customized and performance driven.", "So there will be movement in the right direction off of that and we think over the next few years they could be very significant accounts for us.", "Operator", "This concludes the Q&A session. I\u2019d like to turn the call to Dave Aldrich for closing comments.", "David Aldrich", "This concludes our call today and on behalf of the entire Skyworks team thank you so much for your participation and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and on road shows.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

This call is being recorded.  Now, at this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Tom Schiller, Investor Relations.", "Thomas Schiller", "", "Welcome to Skyworks second fiscal quarter 2010 conference call.  Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Don Palette, our Chief Financial Officer; and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing.  Dan will begin today\u2019s call with a business overview followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook.  We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time-to-time in our SEC filings.  ", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we have used in the past.  Please refer to our press release within the investor relations section of our company\u2019s website for a complete reconciliation of GAAP. ", "With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich ", "I\u2019m pleased to report today that the Skyworks team delivered better than seasonal performance in the March quarter, demonstrating solid operating leverage with both gross and operating margin expansion.  As a result we exceeded our updated top and bottom line financial guidance provided back in March and at a higher level we are making progress across each of our strategic objectives and are benefitting from several macro growth trends as Skyworks transitions to a highly diversified analog company.", "Specifically for the quarter, we delivered revenue of $238 million.  We improved our gross margins by $230 basis points year-over-year to 42.3% and we increased our operating margins by 820 basis points to 20.5%.  In turn, we grew operating income by 130% year-over-year to $49 million and we posted $0.24 of diluted earnings per share versus our updated guidance of $0.22 to $0.23.  ", "Of note and to give you a sense of our broad diversification, during the quarter we shipped to nearly 1,000 customers of which only one exceeded 10% of our total revenue.  Now, with respect to cash we generated $60 million of cash flow from operations and we exited the quarter with $412 million of cash.  Now, this is even after a $40 million outlay for convertible debt retirement.  ", "Finally, we are guiding to 10% to 15% sequential revenue growth with earnings per share of $0.30 in the June quarter. Now, just to digress a bit from the numbers and to give you a more macro perspective, we believe our results today and outlook underscore several accelerating market trends.  First is the increasing ubiquity of broadband access across both wireless and wire lined networks.  The second trend is the apparent insatiable consumer demand for always on connectivity for things like audio, video, text and social networking.  Third, the emergence of a host of new wireless applications and really slick consumer friendly platforms enabled by reliable and affordable technologies.  ", "Now, I\u2019d like to step back for a moment.  Quite frankly, each of these macro trends is still in the early stages of development.  At the same time we are increasingly beginning to see multiple mobile internet access to devices per person beyond the traditional cellular handset and even Smartphones to now encompassing things like high resolution tablets, netbooks and other products we haven\u2019t even yet thought of.", "Meanwhile, wireless local area networking [inaudible] functionality is being integrated within things like gaming consoles, LED televisions, Blu-Ray players and smart appliances.  So in short, virtually all next generation electronics are embedding some form of wireless network connectivity.  So on today\u2019s call we\u2019ll talk about how Skyworks is capitalizing of these trends and even in some small ways enabling these rapidly expanding opportunities with analog semiconductors.", "More specifically, we\u2019ll highlight our traction within Smartphones, within network infrastructure and smart grid applications, three of our key growth engines and we\u2019ll discuss why we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to outpace market growth.  ", "To start with regard to Smartphones, this is perhaps the most exciting mobile communications market today given the ever expanding range of applications and broad consumer acceptance.  Skyworks is uniquely positioned as a supplier to all leading Smartphones OEMs and according to Oppenheimer, this category is enjoying three to four times the 8% to 10% anticipated overall handset growth rate in 2010 and 2011.", "In our case, this market is growing at an even steeper trajectory given the rising analog content opportunity as consumers shift to 3G and OEMs increasingly offer carriers phones with global roaming capability.  Compounding this growth, we are gaining additional share as OEMs seek to lower their bill of materials and integrate edge front end modules with multiple WCDMA bands in smaller, more power efficient and more cost effective modules.  ", "By sweeping more functionality in to our analog solutions, we\u2019re able to improve size, battery life and affordability increasing our dollar content while at the same time raising competitive barriers.  In other words, we\u2019re in a unique position today where our competitive playing field is narrowing even as our customers increasingly require system level expertise and highly integrated solutions built on proprietary intellectual property rather than a more costly discreet implementation.  This trend increasingly favors Skyworks.  As a result we believe we will continue to outpace the market growth rate towards our goal of achieving clear market leadership within this strategic segment.  ", "Moving from Smartphones, secondly we continue to gain momentum on the other side of the mobile Internet connection and that is network infrastructure.  As mobile operators begin to install new base stations, routers and back haul network equipment to avoid network traffic jams and to preserve their highly profitable data service revenue.  According to CISCO\u2019s latest forecast, worldwide mobile data traffic is expected to double every year through 2014 to nearly four Exabyte per month.", "Now, just to give you a sense, one Exabyte of data is equivalent to the content including within 250 million DVDs, 250 million.  So obviously Internet infrastructure will require significant capacity expansion to support this growth.  To that end, we\u2019ve developed a portfolio of network infrastructure solutions including attenuators, VCO synthesizers, mixers, low noise amplifiers and demodulators.  ", "Additionally during the quarter we launched the industries first suite of high performance broadband synthesizers, spanning ultra wide frequency ranges and we\u2019ve captured key design wins at CISCO, at Ericsson, at Huawei, at Nokia Siemens.  These complex RF subsystems are designed to reduce the size and complexity of networking equipment while enabling greater networking reliability, capacity and efficiency which of course translates in to more service revenue.  ", "Thirdly, as we\u2019ve discussed on prior calls, we continue to see significant growth in the emerging smart grid market as utilities and consumers alike seek to better measure and manage energy utilization.  Just to frame the opportunity here, consider that there are nearly three billion meters worldwide of which only 8% are automated today.  So, we see a massive retrofit and new deployment opportunities as utilities strive to more efficiently manage their grids in the name of lower administration costs and higher returns on capital.", "Like the Internet itself, smart grids are complex, multilayer networks of networks and are increasing becoming interactive.  This market landscape is made up of a wide variety of components, applications, sensors and control, thus enabling us to leverage several key RF building blocks across a broad ecosystem of energy management suppliers.  ", "For Skyworks over the past few year, we have made very targeted investments in this area to position ourselves to capture share early.  By virtue of our recent design wins, today Skyworks is servicing several multiyear advanced metering infrastructure contracts supporting a variety of US and international utilities.  For example, we\u2019re in high volume production with a number of smart meter suppliers including Itron, Landis&Gyr, Neptune, Sensus and Badger.", "We also continue to enable home automation systems for the consumer.  Here we\u2019re providing ZigBee solutions linking thermostats, air conditioners and appliances.  Of special note, we recently won new business at Honeywell in support of their home security systems and we captured our very first designs at LG Consumer Appliance Group, enabling wireless connectivity amongst a range of smart white good products.  According to IMS Research, in this segment alone shipments of smart meters with home area network gateways are expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 59% from the years 2009 to 2014.  ", "Finally, we continue to leverage our standard analog catalog business to address a variety of mature as well as new vertical markets including automotive, avionics, satellite, medical, military and industrial.  With our global customer base and over 250 analog products we continue to bolster our portfolio with each new customer engagement.  This business increasingly provides us a high margin, diversified customer base along with annuity product life cycles.", "In summary, given all of these growth engines, we are setting the stage for an even stronger second half of 2010 and we believe widening of the GAAP between overall market growth and our performance.  In fact, by simply annualizing our June quarter outlook, we are now on a greater than $1 billion revenue run rate with earnings of $1 per share.  This is even before the second half of 2010 ramp.", "These financial milestones represent yet another step in the transformation of Skyworks in to a high margin, diversified analog semiconductor market leader, all positioning us to create a greater competitive advantage and to continue to create shareholder value.  I\u2019ll now turn this over to Don for his review.", "Donald W. Palette ", "I will first provide a quick summary of our second fiscal quarter results and then outline our business outlook.  Revenue for the period was $238.1 million, up 38% year-over-year and surpassing our updated guidance range of $230 to $235 million which we provided on March 1st.  Gross profit was $100.7 million or 42.3% of revenue, a 230 basis point year-over-year expansion which was driven by a product mix that increasingly includes higher margin, vertical market and 3G solutions, a volume ramp of new products, continued manufacturing productivity enhancements, product end-to-end yield improvements and significant material cost reductions.  ", "Operating expenses were $52 million of which R&D was $30.3 million and SG&A was $21.7 million, yielding $48.7 million of operating income and a 20.5% operating margin.  Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was $700,000 of expense while taxes were $3.8 million, a cash tax rate of 8%.  As a result, our net income was $44.2 million or $0.24 of diluted earnings per share.  ", "Now, turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter we generated $60 million in cash flow from operations.  We recorded $11 million of depreciation, retired our March 2010 convertible debt at maturity with a $40 million outlay and we invested $20 million in capital expenditures.  As a result, we exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $412 million or $2.25 on a per share basis.", "Now, to our business outlook, based on strong demand across multiple markets we anticipate 10% to 15% sequential revenue growth in our third fiscal quarter.  Assuming revenue of $268 million at the midpoint of this range, we are forecasting gross margin of 43%, operating expenses between $54 and $55 million yielding an operating margin approaching 23%.  Below the line we expect $700,000 of net interest expense and an 8% cash tax rate.", "In turn we are forecasting diluted earnings per share of $0.30 off of a base of 185 million shares.  This trajectory is consistent with our medium term financial targets outlined previously, namely operating margins in the mid 20s on revenues in the $280 to $300 million range.  This model was highly achievable in the near term and strikes the right balance between gaining market share, enhancing margins and most importantly maximizing our return on invested capital.  ", "Further, given the strengthen of our business model, we expect additional leverage well beyond the mid 20% range as we continue to scale and further diversify Skyworks.  That concludes our prepared remarks.  Operator go ahead and open up the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Alex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities", "I was wondering if you could help with that leverage beyond 25%, what is driving it?  Is it the new product areas, is it the upgrade cycle to 3G/4G, the modular, just maybe some color beyond what\u2019s giving you that confidence and maybe some timeline behind that as well?", "David J. Aldrich ", "It is a lot of what you suggested, I\u2019ll let Don comment specifically on where the financial leverage is but it is a combination of continuing to see higher dollar content platforms being introduced in to the market.  Those platforms typically have high contribution margins, higher than the ones they\u2019ve replaced frankly. There is sort of an indication that our customers are indeed willing to pay for integration, they\u2019re willing to pay for innovation and I think you can sort of begin to see that in the results.", "We\u2019re also seeing more vertical market opportunities as we move from infrastructure in to smart grid which today is our highest growth business even though it started at a relatively small base with very high margins in our catalog business and increasing set of vertical markets.  So it\u2019s a combination of high dollar content within our mobile business, high contribution margins and more vertical opportunities. ", "Donald W. Palette ", "Just to comment on the model, we just went through the guidance which $268 and 43% margins, $54.5 million in operating expenses, you\u2019re closer to that 23%.  The operating margin is going to continue to expand as we continue to grow the top line.  The operating expenses at this point are relatively fixed, minor changes in that.  You\u2019re going to get tremendous leverage on that line and we are going to continue to expand product margins, leveraged off of what Dave talked about in the market place is what\u2019s really going to move us beyond the 25%.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "I wanted to dig in a little bit in to first of all the sources of the outside relative to your own internal plan.  Don, maybe you can highlight the one or two things that really surprised you to the upside in the quarter?  Second, in regards to the outlook, any color in there on the cellular contribution versus the linear products?  Sort of what is going to grow faster, what is it that incrementally is making that push?", "David J. Aldrich ", "I think with respect to what upside we saw in the margins, we do try to be conservative in our guidance.  We factor in all the inputs from our customers, we go bottoms up and top down, we look at our bookings level and Don\u2019s pretty conservative.  We try to approach it in a prudent way and in this case our assumptions were a bit more conservative.  We did see some specific traction in smart grid, that business grew nicely in the quarter and we continue to see 3G platforms introduced where we get much higher dollar content than the 2 to 2.5 platforms that they replace.  As we discussed in our prepared comments, it\u2019s really all of those things.  ", "Donald W. Palette ", "Also, as far as for the product margins this is the first quarter where we had full six inch production and until you actually start producing wafers, see what the yields are going to be, you really don\u2019t know for sure what benefits you\u2019re going to get.  From that end, the benefit was a little bit better than expected so that roll out has gone very, very well and that has contributed as well.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Just to follow up with a couple specific customers, is there a way you can give us an update on your progress with Nokia?  Also, the Chinese, they\u2019ve been very strong all around, how is your business shaping out there, how do you see yourself positioned there?", "Liam K. Griffin ", "With respect to Nokia, we continue along a path towards success here with this account.  This last quarter they were a high single digit customer.  They\u2019re going to grow throughout the year.  We are now moving from supporting largely WCDMA in to now addressing their mid tier portfolios and I think what\u2019s really notable for us and I think strategically an advantage is that we are participating with each and every one of their base band suppliers, ST-Ericsson, Infineon, Qualcomm and even Broadcom.  So we expect Nokia to be a meaningful driver for share in the back half of 2010 and through 2011.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "And the Chinese?", "Liam K. Griffin ", "With respect to China?  China has always been a strong position for Skyworks.   Our share continues to look very strong here.  Our relationships Mediatech are outstanding.  We\u2019ve actually augmented our position in 2G handsets with some upside in infrastructure.  We have new designs at Huawei, we\u2019re even now penetrating ZT on datacards.  So in addition to the Mediatech position, I like the way we diversified here in some of the non-handset markets.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "With respect to the outlook in the three segments: energy efficiency; linear products; and then the core business, how should we expect the relative growth rates to shake out?  About even or is one going to be much stronger than the other two?", "David J. Aldrich ", "Well, energy management will grow faster off of as I said relatively modest basis, now, 20% of our non handset business but it is growing faster.  We believe in a targeted way, as we discussed in the prepared comments that infrastructure is going to begin to get more play for us as these new products, these synthesizers, these VCOs which are highly integrated, highly valued we believe by the selected customers we\u2019re going after and so I think we\u2019re going to gain some traction there.", "But, this whole phenomena of always on connectivity and driving more Smartphones, more exciting apps, tablets, ebooks, that\u2019s not going to go away any time soon.  It\u2019s going to be a little bit of a horse race here but clearly we think between the linear product opportunities and handsets will grow, I think we\u2019ll remain roughly stable as a percentage.  Energy management will grow faster and I think begin to become meaningful for us over the next few quarters.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "As you look at the part of the PA and front end opportunity that is tablet and PC dongles, etc., that content that\u2019s cellular but not in handset devices, how big do you see that market being now?

Griffin ", "It\u2019s difficult to exactly understand the market TAM because each and every quarter there is a new innovative solution that is released to the market.  I think to Dave\u2019s opening remarks, you can see this proliferation.  So we are seeing a lot of devices that we\u2019ll call Internet appliances.  They may be USB dongles, they may be tablets, we\u2019re even seeing potentially a move where some of the plasma TV folks that now have Wi-Fi are considering a cellular radio.", "Right now, we think that market is very roughly 80 to 100 million unit market or more that is above and beyond our $1.25 billion handset space.  It will grow materially over the next several years and quite frankly again, we\u2019re not sure how many new devices could be added but that TAM is on the move.

Aldrich ", "One of the things Cody about six inch conversion is just going in general adding a step function increase as the diameter of wafers increase.  When you flip on the switch it really doesn\u2019t do a heck of a lot for margins initially because it enables a great deal more revenue.  So what it really does is it allows you to increase your contribution margin as your revenue increases.  So you should begin to see we have a lot of capacity now in gallium arsenide, we have ability to continue to modulate what we purchase on the outside versus what we produce on the inside.", "That gives our customers a great deal of comfort and it gives us a lot of upside and it has increased our contribution margin here as we run the business.  We\u2019ve got bricks and mortar capacity to double the size of the revenue of this company with high contribution margin as it relates to now HPT so it gives us tons of upside.  You\u2019ll see us begin to grow in to that high contribution as each subsequent quarter\u2019s revenue increases.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Analyst for Stephen Ferranti \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "Analyst for Stephen Ferranti \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "In the smart meter business I know that you guys have been doing business with the likes of Itron and [ESCO] just to name a few.

Are most of the small meter opportunities that you\u2019re seeing North American based or are you also seeing international opportunities as well?", "Liam K. Griffin ", "As we mentioned it\u2019s a global market.  I think the US has really been at the forefront of this and a lot of the utilities in the west coast have really led the drive.  You\u2019ve mentioned a few of our current customers Itron, [ESCO], Neptune, Sensus, there are several others that are pursuing.  One notable account that we\u2019re working with today what we don\u2019t have business with that we certainly have a line of sight to new revenue streams would be a company called Silver Spring Networks in the bay area.  ", "With respect to geographies, as much as this is a success here in the US, we absolute think this will move to Europe and eventually I think there could be a huge play in the Asian market.

Aldrich ", "I think you should expect seasonality.  I think you will see factors that will offset it as this quarter the change between December and March was far less than normal seasonality.  It was because we were gaining share and continuing to outpace the market by penetrating new verticals as well as gaining customers and sockets within mobile. So I do think you should expect seasonality, I expect a strong overall market and I expect that we will outperform it rather handily as we continue to ramp some of these new programs that we have been discussing and as we continue to ramp programs that are outside the handset space.", "Suji DeSilva \u2013 Kaufman Brothers", "Then I don\u2019t know if you gave this or not but if the mix this quarter of analog versus handset within analog how much of that is smart meter at this point?", "Donald W. Palette ", "The actual mix of our broad line analog business was roughly a quarter of revenue with handset revenue being about 75% which has been consistent with where we have been running the last three or four quarters.  As far as where we were this quarter on smart meter a little bit below 20% of the analog total.", "Suji DeSilva \u2013 Kaufman Brothers", "The last question, really data cards you guys talked about that being kind of more silent growth opportunity that is happening.  How is that proceeding for you guys?  Is that significantly outgrowing the company growth for you guys?  Is your share there stable or improving?", "David J. Aldrich ", "Well our share is growing in that space and that element itself within the market is growing quite a bit. What you see is you see the USB dongle, you also see embedded chipsets that are really taking off.  I think some of the most significant base band players now are really developing some really cutting edge solutions that you\u2019ll see embedded within netbooks and laptops and we\u2019re well positioned to see some upside from that as well.  So I think it\u2019s a great new use for cellular technology and our devices and again, it will continue to expand through this year and then several years beyond.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Patrick Newton \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Patrick Newton \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "A question I guess for Liam, regarding smart meter with the product already representing 20% of your revenue and I think previously you had said the target for the full year was 20% with the higher growth rate than the linear market as a whole where do you think smart meter can now exit the year as a contribution to analog?", "Liam K. Griffin ", "That\u2019s a good question.  It will probably tick up a few points.  We\u2019ve been on a very steady progressive growth rate here.  We\u2019re adding customers, our customers have well defined program ramps for utilities.  We have opportunities.  I think really the big opportunity right now for expansion is going to be in the home area network with our ZigBee technology.  We alluded to a couple of design wins here in the prepared remarks and one of the most notable for us is moving in to an account like LG and their consumer appliance division where they\u2019re going to be rolling out ZigBee enabled white goods appliances.", "I think the upside in my opinion, the meters themselves are well characterized, the home area network is where we could see some real material gains here late this year and over the next certainly 2012 through 2015 even.", "Patrick Newton \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Don, one for you, I think previously you had given the expectation of an 8% tax rate through 2010 and then tax planning allowing about a 12% in 2011.  I was wondering if you can update us on the progress made towards that 2011 goal?  Maybe even walk us through how you manage to keep the rate so low and then perhaps the sustainability of that 12% rate in the out years?", "Donald W. Palette ", "We\u2019ve given 8% for the balance of the year and we actually for 2011 and 2012 we\u2019re looking at a rate between 10% and 12%.  That rate is going to be dependent upon where earnings go too because there are some variables in that rate that change as earnings increase but that\u2019s a good number for you guys to use in your models now. The way that we\u2019re doing that, if you look at this year, this year we have $90 million of NOLs remaining that are shielding our income that\u2019s allowing us to keep it at 8%.  ", "We are putting some business initiatives in place, actually one was implemented for the second half of this year, one will be implemented for the first quarter of next year that will allow us to do some tax strategies and some tax planning that allow us to keep that rate at 10% to 12% for 2011 and 2012.

And, perhaps if you see the six inch but also some of the mix change?", "Donald W. Palette ", "As I said earlier when we were talking about the model, as we drive towards the goal of 25% and beyond it\u2019s a combination of both margin expansion and leveraging our operating expense base.  We just guided to 43% so you can model this as we grow to $280 to $300 or beyond in revenue and use a contribution of in excess of 50%, you can see that margin is going to continue to expand and that\u2019s our expectation.", "It\u2019s a combination of things that we are currently doing, will continue to do and that is focus on the material cost reductions, continuing to drive productivity and yield improvements.  It\u2019s also the releases Dave had talked about earlier of a lot of the new product suites, the higher dollar content, more value add in the market place, we believe all that is going to drive margin expansion.  It is the six inch conversion as well which is going to give us more internal capacity.  All those things are contributing to it.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Do you have an upper framework where you think you\u2019d say, \u201cOkay, we want to go for more growth here than margin?\u201d  At the sort of 45 level or something or how should we think about it over time?", "Donald W. Palette ", "We haven\u2019t set any specific targets, we just think there is a lot of opportunity with just leveraging the fixed cost base and the operations as you continue to expand revenue that that number is certainly going to go to a number of 45% and potentially beyond.

Aldrich ", "I think it\u2019s going to be pretty well balanced.  We\u2019re really excited about the growth in these vertical markets that we talked about and the catalog business keeps chugging along.  I think it\u2019s going to be very well balanced for the second half of the year and that\u2019s up against some pretty steep growth in these programs that we described and customer ramps in mobile.

We are really able to leverage this hybrid model that we have where we not only have increased our own internal capacity, you see the targeted capital we put in place over the last couple of quarters has gone right at any potential bottleneck providing us upside to what we see as our customers\u2019 upside forecast.  We don\u2019t want to miss any share opportunities.", "Our purchasing people are frankly out there and they\u2019re doing a good job to make sure that we get more than our fair share of visibility and supply for those components and PCVs and so on that we purchase.  Of course, we did flip the switch on the six inch here so we\u2019ve got not only lots of capacity externally but we\u2019ve got lots of capacity internally for perhaps our most important component in the front end solution which is the gallium arsenide content.

Aldrich ", "Typically, the March to June quarter in handsets is about a 3% to 5% sequential growth in units.  We do see as noted, some great uptick in Smartphones and that really is the vehicle today of choice with consumers and carriers.  Carriers love it for the data service it provides.   Penetration is very, very low in Smartphones outside of the US and Europe. You still have a big market in Asia that is moving.", "So we think Smartphones on a unit basis will continue to outgrow 2G handsets, there\u2019s no question about that.  But, at the same time some of the major markets in 2G, China for example, continue to look solid.  So overall we would put about 3% to 5% at the high end, mid range about 3% to 4% for unit growth in handsets in general but Smartphones clearly outpacing.", "Dunham Winoto \u2013 Avian Securities", "What do you think is the Smartphone growth rate?", "David J. Aldrich ", "Well, the annual growth rate in Smartphones is 35% to 40% year-over-year and we think that will continue over the next five years.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jonathan Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America.", "Jonathan Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America", "I was hoping you could talk just a little bit more, give us a little bit more color on your China business?  How is the margin profile of that business shaping up?  I know it\u2019s a lower priced product but what\u2019s the cost structure in the margin look like and how do you expect it to trend during the year?", "Liam K. Griffin ", "I\u2019ll start a little bit on the customer dynamics and then I\u2019ll pass it to Don on margin. One of the things that we like about our business in China is we deal directly with the most powerful chipset player there, that\u2019s Mediatech.  So our products are specifically tuned and designed to meet the architectures, the requirements, the specifications and the costs of that customer set.  Beyond that as I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve augmented our handset business in China with some great strengthen now in infrastructure.  Certainly big differences in gross margins between the infrastructure business and what we see in 2G but in both case this is an accretive business for Skyworks and high growth.", "Donald W. Palette ", "Just to reiterate what Liam said, when you look at the business profile of Skyworks and the numerous SKUs that we have and you look across interfaces, a lot of the 2G products in China that we\u2019re serving, we\u2019ve been making those products for a long period of time.  We\u2019re very efficient at those, high yields, high productivity and quite frankly the 2G margins are right in line with the other product profiles that we have.  So there hasn\u2019t been any pressure and in fact, as Liam said, when you look at the overall volume it actually can be slightly accretive, the overall return on the business.  So no negatives there at all.", "Jonathan Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank North America", "Moving to the other end of the spectrum, have you guys made any sort of significant design wins that you maybe can\u2019t talk about but you can sort of hint at that we might be seeing in the next few months?", "David J. Aldrich ", "I think that without talking about specifics if we do our jobs, and we intend to, if we continue to do our jobs the strength of our design capabilities and the scale that we bring to the party and plus the fact that we\u2019re shipping to everybody today, or virtually every major OEM in both the Smartphone and the cellular category.  We would be failing to not have content peppered across the board with various OEMs.  ", "So we don\u2019t look upon one socket or another socket, we think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of continuing to diversify our customer base and we\u2019re disappointed by any 3G or Smartphone, or high end socket where we don\u2019t participate.  We think the technology of ours is superior and our scale is both broader and deeper from a manufacturing standpoint.  We aspire to get a disproportionate share across every customer.

Palette ", "Both.", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equities", "Price erosion, we\u2019ve heard from several of your competitors on that subject this quarter, things are a bit different.  What are you seeing?  The same, more, less, any changes from historic?", "Liam K. Griffin ", "Ed, we\u2019re seeing nothing out of the ordinary right now and ASP erosion for us is actually a little bit less erosion than we saw last year.  Our content per phone though is increasing and in some cases we\u2019re looking at blended ASPs that are actually going up on a year-over-year basis.", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equities", "That\u2019s primarily content, if you\u2019re dealing with one modular one band are we still seeing the standard 15% to 20% a year erosion in that?", "Liam K. Griffin ", "No, nothing like that.  If you\u2019re taking same part year-over-year we\u2019re in the single digits here.", "Donald W. Palette ", "First of all, we never saw 20%.  We\u2019ve been seeing 6%, or 7%, or 8% here now the third year in a row on a part-to-part basis whereas each new solution or each new platform tends to be a little higher in revenue.  So I don\u2019t think you should look at it that way.  The real change has been in the last couple of years as there are increasingly more complexity behind these devices.  We\u2019re being designed in upfront with the base band solution and we\u2019re sole sourcing more often than not in the platform so the pricing structure of the  yield curve, the cost structure is known, it\u2019s negotiated in advanced, it\u2019s well understood.", "We\u2019re we think as good as anybody in the industry in predicting what those production ramps are going to be.  So, you shouldn\u2019t be looking at 20% ASP erosion across any of our markets and customers.  As Liam mentioned, it\u2019s typically been for the third year in a row now in the 7% to 8% range part-to-part with increasing dollar content on average per phone.", "Edward Snyder \u2013 Charter Equities", "It certainly seems like we\u2019ve gotten in to the second phase of the growth in the industry, you have to go back to I guess \u201997 to 2000 when HPT first showed up to see such consistent improvement in the content for RSM.  We\u2019re hearing it across all the other OEMs.  To that end, everybody is talking about relatively tight capacity in their production, I heard it out of RFMicro, I heard it out of [inaudible] last night, not so much your supply of wafers but in your ability to produce nothing drastic but you outsource a portion of yours, is that capacity also seeing some tightness and does that affect your ability in the flexible manufacturing realm?", "David J. Aldrich ", "In terms of HPT we discussed earlier we now have lots of capacity both dedicated externally and what we\u2019re able to exercise now as the result of the six inch conversion.  That\u2019s a great big deal for us.  We have heard of potential constraints for example in the packaging area.  Here\u2019s an areas where we have the capability to do it all in house and we have the capability and the desire to do some of it on the outside based upon wanting to maintain flexibility.", "So on packaging we\u2019re in very good shape but on the assembly case you may hear some shortages with others.  Remember, we\u2019re kind of unique in that we can produce the majority and if we need to all of our own packaging, all of our own assembly.  We think that\u2019s a competitive supply chain advantage, it\u2019s a time to market advantage and it is definitely a margin and a cost advantage for us.", "Donald W. Palette ", "To reiterate that, we\u2019re still outsourcing roughly about 15% of our assembly operation.  That number isn\u2019t changing in our forecast dramatically and with some of these targeted cap ex investments that Dave described, that puts us in a position to handle the demand that we need to handle.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Nathan Johnson \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities.", "Nathan Johnson \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "One housekeeping I was curious if you guys had mentioned how far booked you guys are to the midpoint of your guidance?", "Donald W. Palette ", "We\u2019re approaching 100%, a very, very high percentage at this point.", "Nathan Johnson \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Then on operating expenses, it looks like you\u2019re looking for a little bit of a step up this quarter.  I was wondering how we should view op ex going forward as you see revenue increase?  Are we at a level that you can be consistent at for a while or do you see SG&A tracking upwards with revenue?", "Donald W. Palette ", "I think it\u2019s at this roughly $54.5 to $55 million level.  I think that we\u2019re going to be relatively static, it just depends on the revenue growth that you\u2019re describing and that certainly shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s not going to move a lot in the short term.  Annually, you have pay increases, there are other things that can drive that number up a little bit but it isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s going to move in the short term.", "David J. Aldrich ", "It\u2019s our expectation that our op ex will drop substantially as a percentage of revenue as we move throughout 2010 and 2011.  If we see targeted investments or small increases they will nonetheless be a lot lower than the overall revenue growth rate.", "Nathan Johnson \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "One last one out of me, just looking at the better than seasonal guide, you guys obviously highlighted a lot of new programs in your press release and then on the call.  I was wondering of that better than seasonal guide, how much of that is associated with new programs versus ones that you already have gone?", "David J. Aldrich ", "The majority of that ramp is really new designs.  New design wins in many cases we captured the business last quarter or the December quarter and it\u2019s now coming to fruition.  It\u2019s a good mix of healthy base and diversification as well as new program ramps in both non handsets and in targeted handset platforms.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Alex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities", "I wanted to ask Dave, I know you mentioned seasonality for the third quarter but given the booming second quarter you have do you mean it more along the lines of the typical 8% to 10% type of seasonality or do we have that potential to see with new design wins coming on acceleration from what you just put up in Q2?", "David J. Aldrich ", "Well, I think to be clear are we talking about the market or are we talking about Skyworks?", "Alex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities", "We\u2019re talking about Skyworks that I\u2019m curious about there.  With your pipeline of new design wins and improving mix of 3G, obviously we\u2019d expect and you\u2019ve mentioned this, we\u2019d expect some improved seasonality.  How does that leverage continue that you saw in Q2?", "David J. Aldrich ", "Well, we do think that it continues and it\u2019s for the reasons we talked about in our prepared comments.  We are seeing some targeted program ramps in and outside of the handsets. We are participating disproportionately in the Smartphone sector and that\u2019s the highest growth rate within mobile.  March is a seasonally low quarter in the market, we did much better than that.  Our guidance is for much higher growth rate in June than the market and we expect it to continue.  I\u2019ll be very clear, we\u2019re going to take share and we\u2019re targeting those applications and margins that are higher ASP and higher margin.  We\u2019ll be very disappointed if we don\u2019t significantly outpace the sequential growth rate of this market.", "Alex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities", "With regard to those higher ASP products, I was wondering if you could describe whether either by naming the platform or just the type of platform, what is your highest ASP?  What is that radio content look like, how many modules or what type of module?  If you had a marquee design win that you\u2019re pointing to this is what Skyworks can do, can you describe that for us?", "David J. Aldrich ", "It\u2019s roughly $8.  A marquee design would be on a quad band edge device with multiple bands of wide band CDMA where we have swept in not only the amplification but we\u2019ve swept in the filtering, switching and conditioning integrated in to a module that pulled in much of the passive content and so the total content gets you to maybe $10.  Since we don\u2019t do higher power duplexes for example we would max out today at about $8.", "But you know what I think is an even better way of looking at this, there are very, very few platforms that give us or anybody else $8 in analog content.  There are a whole slew, and the majority of phones today are still in the GPRS range that are $1.  So what\u2019s really going to happen is by integrating all of these passive functions and by continuing to come out with these new multimode devices it is going to be the $1 moving to $4 that\u2019s going to drive the TAM of our business much much more than what happens to the $8.", "The $8 is a drop in the bucket compared to the $1s and $2s that are rapidly going to $3 and $4.  That\u2019s where the market is going to land over the next three to four years.  I would caution you don\u2019t worry about the $8, we don\u2019t think about the $8 we think about the $1.", "Operator", "", "With that this does conclude today\u2019s Q&A portion of the call.

This call is being recorded. Now at this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Tom Schiller, Investor Relations. Mr. Schiller, please go ahead.", "Thomas Schiller", "", "Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks F3Q 2010 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Palette, our Chief Financial Officer, and Liam Griffin, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Dave will begin today\u2019s call with a business overview, followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines to your questions.", "Please note that the statements today will contain comments referring to future results that are forward looking as defined in the Securities Litigation Form Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement. It is consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the investor relations section of our company website for our complete reconciliation with GAAP.", "With that I will now turn the call over to Dave with his comments on the quarter.", "David Aldrich", "", "Thank you, Tom, and welcome everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report today that Skyworks exceeded F3Q guidance for revenue, the gross and operating margin, as well as earnings per share. This is driven by our momentum in mobile internet and continued penetration into new vertical markets and a broad set of diversified analog applications.", "Specifically for the quarter, we delivered revenue of $275 million. This is up 44% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. We expanded our gross margin to 43.3%, and our operating margin to 23.1%. In turn we grew operating income 122% year-over-year to $64 million, and we posted $0.32 to EPS \u2013 now this is $0.02 better than our guidance. ", "With respect to the balance sheet, we retired another $20 million of March 2010 convertible debt, and we exited the quarter with $390 million of cash. ", "As our results reflect, we continue to make progress along our strategic objectives, and these are namely first, diversifying across both end markets and customers; second, continuously improving our operational execution and in turn delivering leverage and higher financial returns.", "Now I\u2019ll go through each briefly. First, on the diversification front, we are adding new customers and we\u2019re entering new vertical markets. When we talk about vertical markets we\u2019re really referring to underserved, high margin segments where we can provide a custom analog solution that leverages our broad technology footprint to improve our customer\u2019s overall system performance. ", "And in addition to entering new markets, we\u2019re expanding our customer base. Not that long ago, you may recall, our revenue was heavily concentrated with a few tier-one handset OEMs, and today not only do we support the industry-leading handset manufacturers and smartphone providers, we\u2019re also delivering highly-integrated solutions to key energy management suppliers such as Itron, Silver Spring Networks, Sensus, Landis + GYR, while addressing new markets and vertical applications.", "I\u2019d like to give just a few examples of our diversifications, specifically during the quarter. Some examples are we\u2019ve ramped DBS solutions in support of DirecTV and the Dish Network. We commenced shipments of attenuators for Cisco\u2019s multi-room DVR for use in Verizon\u2019s FIOS applications. We captured key design wins with broadband control ICs at some leading netbook and network OEMs. We supported Garmin\u2019s GPS business and Europe\u2019s largest supplier of electric toll tag systems with next generation analog components. And finally we powered Samsung\u2019s 4G USB modem. This is the world\u2019s first commercialized LTE device. These are just among a few concrete examples of our diversification strategies and practice.", "Okay, now with respect to operational execution, we improved end-to-end manufacturing yields during the quarter, we continued to drive to reduce our development cycle times while increasing inventory turns. And in addition we continue to seek operations to leverage our scale advantage and our hybrid outsourcing model.", "And finally, as our improving fundamentals reflect, we\u2019ve made substantial progress towards our established financial targets. Last quarter we delivered a 280 basis point year-over-year expansion in gross margin, and an 820 basis point in our operating margin. And we have specific action plans in place to deliver further improvements. ", "Okay, now that we\u2019ve hopefully put our strategy into context, let me elaborate on what\u2019s fueling Skyworks\u2019 top line growth, and how we positioned ourselves to outpace our addressable markets. ", "Today we\u2019re capitalizing on three distinct business segments \u2013 mobile internet, vertical markets, and analog components. So first, with regard to the mobile internet, we believe the smartphone segment is poised to grow at 3x to 4x the 8% to 10% growth rate anticipated for the overall cellular handset market. For Skyworks, this market is growing at an even faster pace, given our increasingly customized solutions and our very strong relationships with leading OEMs along with the rising tide of analog content, as carriers and consumers shift to band-intensive 3G and 4G platforms. And we\u2019re very fortunate today to be shipping to virtually all cellular OEMs and smartphone providers.", "Another rapidly growing segment that is often overlooked is embedded wireless. We estimate that there are 50 million units of USB modems, tablets, and mobile hotspots that were sold in 2009, scaling to roughly 250 million by 2013. This is an 83% compounded growth rate. And this outlook we think could prove conservative given the opportunity to easily upgrade the world\u2019s online computers with 3G and 4G USB modems on top of this entirely new tablet category, which is clearly off to a very strong start. And we continue to gain traction on the other side of the mobile internet connection as well within network infrastructure, as mobile operators begin to install new base stations, routers, and back haul network equipment to avoid network traffic jams and to preserve their highly profitable data service revenue stream. ", "To support this growth we\u2019ve developed a portfolio of network infrastructure solutions that include attenuators, BCO synthesizers, mixers, low noise amplifiers and demodulators; and specifically during the quarter we introduced high performance broadband synthesizers spanning ultra wide frequency ranges. We ramped LTE attenuators at Erickson, and we\u2019re very proud that we received a Milestone Technology Award from WAWE in recognition of excellence in base station innovation. Very proud of that.", "So in short global penetration of the mobile internet will entail upgrades to both existing client devices, as well as to the spurring network infrastructure. And at Skyworks we\u2019ve deployed resources to secure an early mover advantage as these segments continue to ramp.", "Now, the second leg of our growth strategy is we\u2019re in new vertical markets. As we\u2019ve outlined in the past, we continue to make investments in systems applications and design within adjacent high margin analog segments. A couple of recent examples include smart grid and home and building automation applications. According to a recent study by ABI Research, cumulative growth investment in smart grid will exceed $45 billion in the next five years, as both government and utilities repair, upgrade, and transform their aging infrastructure. Smart grid offers utilities real-time, two-way communications with each segment of the electrical grid accessing local, loads, usage, and efficiency 24 hours a day. Much of the developed world relies on energy transmission technology, an infrastructure that was built between 60 and 80 years ago \u2013 and it\u2019s beginning to show its age particularly as users experience usage restrictions and brown outs.", "Meanwhile we\u2019re beginning to see home and building applications take shape. Here we\u2019re providing ZigBee-based solutions for security monitoring and management. Specific applications include lighting control, door and window sensors, as well as wireless appliance and temperature controllers. The customer set here includes Honeywell, GE, LG, and Whirlpool. Now following more than a decade of promise, we now see the home and building automation market gaining real momentum given demand for green technologies, for enhanced security and energy conservation. Skyworks has added significant value through analog integration and by leveraging our scale.", "Finally, as a third growth sector we are leveraging our standard analog catalog business to address a myriad of mature and emerging segments. Today, with more than 1000 customers and with over 2500 analog products, our solutions are being leveraged across a broad set of applications including automotive, avionics, satellite, medical, military and industrial, just to name a few. This business increasingly provides us higher margins, a very diversified customer base, and long, almost annuity-like product life cycles.", "In summary, given these growth drivers we are entering the back half of 2010 on a steep growth trajectory, underpinned by our accelerating design and momentum, and our deep product pipeline. Stepping back, Skyworks continues to execute towards the multi-year business transformation we\u2019ve outlined. We\u2019ve made the investments necessary to capitalize on the growth in our addressable markets, to deliver operating leverage and in turn we believe to continue to create shareholder value. ", "I\u2019ll now turn this call over to Don for his financial review.", "Donald Palette", "", "Thanks, Dave. And thanks for joining us, everyone. First, I will provide a quick summary of our F3Q results and then outline our business outlook. Revenue for the period was $275.4 million, up 44% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, versus our guidance of 10% to 15% sequential growth. Gross profit was $119.2 million, or 43.3% of revenue, a 280 basis point year-over-year expansion which was driven by a product mix that increasingly includes higher-margin vertical markets and 3G solutions, volume ramp of new products, continued manufacturing productivity enhancements, product and yield improvements and significant cost reductions.", "Operating expenses were $55.6 million, of which R&D was $33 million and SG&A was $22.6 million, yielding $63.5 million of operating income and a 23.1% operating margin, an 820 basis point improvement year-over-year.", "Our net interest and other income expense for the quarter was $400,000 of expense, while taxes were $4.4 million, a 7% tax rate. As a result our net income was $58.7 million, or $0.32 of diluted earnings per share versus our guidance of $0.30. ", "Turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter we recorded $12 million of depreciation. We retired $20 million of convertible debt, and we invested $25 million in capital expenditures as we anticipate a strong second half ramp. As a result we exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $390 million. ", "Now to our business outlook: Based on specific program ramps and backlog coverage, we are forecasting F4Q revenue of $300 million, gross margin expansion to between 43.5% and 44%, and operating expenses of approximately $55.5 million to $56 million, yielding a 25% operating margin which is squarely on track to our previously outlined medium-term operating model target. Below the line we expect $400,000 of net interest expense and other income expense, and a 7% cash tax rate.", "In turn we expect to deliver diluted earnings per share of $0.37 off of a base of 186,000,000 shares. Further, based on our innovative product portfolio and strong operational execution, we expect to deliver sustainable growth, expanding margins, and operating leverage from our current $1.2 billion annualized revenue run rate, and earnings based on nearly $1.50 per share. In fact, we plan to elaborate on our growth drivers and introduce our new financial model at our upcoming Analyst Day, September 21st in Boston.", "Well that concludes our prepared remarks, and Operator, you can go ahead and open up the lines for questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions). Our first question will come from Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Parag Agarwal \u2013 UBS", "Thanks for taking my questions and great job on the quarter. Firstly I wanted to drill down on your gross margin; you did spend it very well. As w go forward and you near capacity, just wondering how much headroom we have in the gross margins. And also could you elaborate about your manufacturing strategy given that you are bringing in a lot of capacity in house?", "Don Palette", "", "Parag, thanks for the question. This is Don. We believe we have a lot of headroom left in the margin, and you know, we talked about a number of, at minimum 45% on a go forward basis as we continue to expand the top line. And a lot of the levers that are going to allow us to do that are the same that you\u2019ve seen in the past. One of the key things is going to be product mix. As we ramp our new margin degree of products - which are a higher percentage of vertical market and 3G solutions, and they have a pretty good margin, the overall margin of the business - we\u2019re going to get a nice benefit from that. We\u2019re going to continue to diversify our revenue base. ", "Clearly volume and scale will allow us to continue to expand margins, and something that we focus on on a day-to-day basis \u2013 operational execution. We're going to continue to deliver improvements in key metrics at all of our factories and you know, we\u2019ve also got our cutover to the 6\u201d wafers and then there\u2019s targeted margin expanding CAPEX investments we\u2019re making as well. So all those things are going to contribute to moving our margins forward.", "Parag Agarwal \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And as a follow-up, you hinted towards a strong ramp in second half. Just wondering if you could provide more color on that? And also can you talk about ramp, the Nokia ramp, update us on the Nokia ramp into the second half?", "David Aldrich", "", "Okay, well we only guide obviously one quarter out but we do see that the programs we\u2019ve identified in both our cellular business and smartphones as well as our vertical markets are continuing to gain some traction, so we expect to see ongoing sequential growth in those areas. So we\u2019re excited about that. As we outlined in the prepared comments we now have the three legs of the stool, which is not only our smartphone and cellular business, but an increasing list of vertical markets that have a lot of headway for us as well as our ongoing growth in our catalog business.", "With respect to Nokia, this quarter they\u2019re roughly a 10% customer. We\u2019re very happy with that, we\u2019re proud of that. And we have just begun to ramp into some of the segments where we haven\u2019t previously participated. So we see ourselves rounding out that portfolio, and as we\u2019ve identified in the past, continue to see sequential growth as we move from primarily being a 3G provider in the past to being lined out in their entire portfolio, we think sometime between now and 2011.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Craig Ellis with Caris Company.", "Brett Piira \u2013 Caris Company", "Thanks for taking my question. This is Brett Piira for Craig Ellis. How should we think about the growth profile of your smart meters going forward? Is that going to be lumpy, pretty steady? And what are your thoughts on when it can become a $100 million business?", "Liam Griffin", "", "Sure, this is Liam. That portfolio for us continues to be one of the most dynamic within our vertical market business. It is a multi-billion dollar end market, there\u2019s no question about that. There\u2019s a great deal of stimulus money behind it in the US, initiatives from utilities and even from the administration.", "Right now it continues to be a leading driver within our non-handset portfolio. We've done a nice job of engaging with some of the top providers of the meters themselves. And then kind of an adjacent market that is really pulling from this is the home automation space, and we see that really growing very rapidly through 2011, all the way through 2015 and beyond. ", "So it\u2019s a business that will continue to grow. It\u2019s not really bump; it\u2019s slow, steady growth for us. And we\u2019re going to be up again this quarter and I think you're going to see sequential growth into 2011.", "Brett Piira \u2013 Caris Company", "Okay, thanks. And then on your backlog coverage, I know last quarter you were pretty close to 100% booked. What\u2019s it looking like this quarter?", "Don Palette", "", "Brett, this is Don. It\u2019s a very similar percentages as we discussed last quarter, and it really goes to the whole process and approach we take to forecasting. We take a very conservative view and we like to have a very, very high coverage and a backlog before we\u2019ll commit and guide to a revenue number.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Alex Guana with JMP Securities.", "Alex Guana \u2013 JMP Securities", "", "Thanks very much, congratulations on the strong quarter. I was wondering if you could talk to maybe some of your exposure in China. There was a little bit of a fall off in media tech environment. I\u2019m wondering if you saw that late in the quarter, if it was disruptive to you; and what the outlook might be for some of the upgrade cycle that\u2019s going on in that market as well.", "Liam Griffin", "Yeah, sure. China is certainly an important market for Skyworks. We\u2019re a big fan of that region. We've invested quite a bit in the ecosystem. To your point we did see some choppiness in the account base there, and we serve up to 100 small OEMs in that market. There has been some choppiness; we think it\u2019s righting itself right now and should improve as we get into the second half of the year to some degree.", "But Alex, in addition to the traditional handset guys that we work with, we are seeing some very good progress across the infrastructure space, mainly with companies like WAWE and BTE; and as Dave noted we were awarded not only the technology award plus plaque but also some great business with WAWE over the last quarter.", "David Aldrich", "And I think one thing I would add is that the business model that we\u2019ve worked very hard to create is in one way we\u2019re diversified across OEM customer set as well as region. So as Liam talked about we have seen softness in China, it\u2019s well publicized, but we also saw relative strength elsewhere. So when we factor all that in, even as we\u2019ve seen OEM shifts for example, we\u2019ve been able to capitalize where there\u2019s been strength and have been able to weather where there\u2019s been weakness. And I think that\u2019s just a factor in our business.", "Overall, the total market looks quite strong and we tend to ride that overall market as we are diversified so broadly and we\u2019re able to take share.", "Alex Guana \u2013 JMP Securities", "", "As a follow-up, is some of that chop expected to continue into the current quarter? And if you could remind us then, what normal seasonality is for the December quarter and if that chop might turn into a benefit in that time frame, if it recovers?", "David Aldrich", "", "Well, when we tabulated our forecast we made the assumption that there would be continued chop. So we factored that into our planning as an attempt to be conservative. And normal seasonality for us is that December quarter would be up maybe 5% to 10%.", "Alex Guana \u2013 JMP Securities", "Okay, thanks very much.", "David Aldrich", "", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll next go to Sanjay Devgan with Morgan Stanley.", "Sanjay Devgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Hey guys, thank you so much for taking my call and great job on the quarter. Just had a question: you\u2019ve had some sizable growth the last couple of quarters, and I just want to touch on your manufacturing strategy. If you could help us understand, or if you had to put a confidence level around your ability to meet demand, are you guys sort of capacity restrained internally and externally or is that not an issue, and kind of the guidance is indicative of the end market demand?", "David Aldrich", "", "Yeah, that\u2019s a great question, and we\u2019re working very hard. In fact, our supply chain people have been with our suppliers across the board here all the time, trying to make sure we secure mindshare and all the capacity we need to support all our customers.", "We did a couple of things Don talked about in the prepared comments \u2013 the investments we made this last quarter in capital expenditures. And if you go back and look at what we said over the last couple of quarters, we are seeing tightness in supply and assembly and test, and we\u2019re seeing it wait for supply. We\u2019re seeing some minor component shortages but they\u2019re very manageable we believe.", "And so what we\u2019ve done in the last couple of quarters, the beauty of our hybrid model is that we have licensed or we can produce internally as well as externally assembly test, PHep and HBT foundry capabilities. So what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve addressed the bottlenecks in all our internal areas and we\u2019ve essentially doubled down and added investment there so that we have the flexibility moving through really the October, November timeframe, and December, that we can pull in what we need to pull in if we get disappointed with either assembly tests or our own wafer side. ", "So I think, I can judge by the tone of your comment \u2013 I share the concern that there\u2019s tightness in supply but we\u2019ve increased the investments we\u2019ve already spent there as a way to address it internally, and to dial up the amount of internal manufacturing if we need to. And I think we may. But we\u2019re going to meet the customers\u2019 demand in either event.", "Sanjay Devgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. And then just as a follow-up I was wondering if you could touch on cutover to the 6\u201d wafers. If you can kind of give us a sense on how that\u2019s progressing relative to expectations, and when we can kind of see that cutover take over.", "Liam Griffin", "", "Well Sanjay, that cutover has occurred. I mean\u2026", "Sanjay Devgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I mean in terms of when you see volume shipments going over 50% with the new 6\u201d.", "David Aldrich", "", "Everything we\u2019re producing now is 6\u201d. So what happened is we converted, we took our 4\u201d line, and I have to hand it to our operating folks \u2013 they actually converted to 6\u201d while running the 4\u201d at very high capacity utilization. You typically don\u2019t see anybody do that. So I\u2019m frankly pretty proud of the way the team operated and executed to that plan. And so when we flipped the switch to 6\u201d or when we migrated to 6\u201d the utilization was reasonably high and you saw no roll off in margin, in fact you saw an improvement \u2013 we see an improvement or accretion in margin.", "Now what we are doing is as demand increases we\u2019ve got plenty of headroom capacity to go internally with this 6\u201d HBT with relatively short lead time, equipment, and human resources or people. So we\u2019re on that path. We see more margin expansion as we grow and we\u2019re able to moderate how much we do internally versus how much we do outside.", "Liam Griffin", "", "Sanjay, that\u2019s the key that causes us to keep that balance and percentage where it needs to be to continue to grow margins.", "Sanjay Devgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great, thank you guys.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll next go to Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer", "", "Hi guys, congratulations on a good quarter. Had a few questions. Don, first of all on the OPEX, it\u2019s starting to move up \u2013 how do we think about that going forward? And also your cash generation this quarter was not all that stellar, a big jump in accounts payable if you can give us some color around that.", "Don Palette", "", "This is Don, Ittai. The first, on the cash usage for the quarter, we actually did consume cash this quarter, roughly around $20 million, but the big driver of that was we spent $33 million to retire some additional convertible debt. It\u2019s a little over $20 million at face value. We\u2019re continuing to focus on optimizing the capital structure \u2013 that\u2019s part of that program. There\u2019s only $27 million of our convertible debt remaining that\u2019s due March 2012. ", "We also, as Dave just alluded to, as part of this making sure that we\u2019re able to handle the customer demand that we expect in the future we increased our capital expenditures for planned program ramps and internal capital expansion. So the takeaway on that is that we expect a very strong cash flow in Q4.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer", "Can you give us more color though around the increase in accounts receivables and payables? It\u2019s one of the biggest I\u2019ve seen in your balance sheets in some time.", "Don Palette", "", "Receivables is a combination just of revenue growth. Our DSO is right in line with what it\u2019s been, there\u2019s no change there; it\u2019s just the timing of revenue shipments. That does affect how quickly you collect. And as far as payables, it\u2019s just in relation- Inventory, we did ramp inventory; that\u2019s just in anticipation of demand in Q4. So that AP just follows the inventory bill \u2013 there\u2019s nothing special going on there. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from Jonathan Goldberg and Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank", "Hi guys, thanks. I was wondering if you could just expand on a question you were talking about earlier in terms of capacity. I'd like to look more at long term. Do you think that the industry can scale? Do you think there\u2019s enough gas capacity out there that you guys can keep up as we start hitting 1.6 billion, 1.7 billion handsets, those kinds of markets?", "David Aldrich", "", "Well, we needed the 6\u201d conversion because when you get the 6\u201d conversion and rough water magnitude you get, each wafer produces a little bit more than 2x the number of dye. So we needed to do that. And now that we\u2019ve gone to 6\u201d we have the opportunity for a relatively small amount of capital to expand that further. We also have an ongoing relationship with an outside provider with a copy-exact process; we can ramp those folks as well. So I think from an HBT standpoint we are in very good shape. ", "And so the answer to your question is as the industry goes to 1.6 billion handsets we have the capacity to produce what is even at our most aggressive unit volume increase and our share aspirations; when we factor both of those in on the aggressive side we have plenty of capacity. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue.", "There is tightness of gallium arsenide supply elsewhere in the market but that\u2019s not a concern of ours because we can do it internally.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "The next question is from Todd Kaufman with Raymond James.", "Todd Kaufman \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Can I just ask again the question with regard to the pretty sharp increase in accounts receivables? It grew significantly, outpacing your growth and your revenue. What was behind that?", "Don Palette", "", "Todd, this is Don. It went up roughly $50 million from Q2 to Q3. We had a $50 million increase last Q2 to Q3. There\u2019s nothing, it really is just a result of revenue ramp and the timing of the shipment. The DSO is actually flat to what we\u2019ve been performing over the last three to four quarters. So it\u2019s not a velocity issue; it\u2019s just the timing of when the revenue ships. That does drive whether we can collect within a 45 to 50 day window that revenue. Nothing else at all impacted that.", "Todd Kaufman \u2013 Raymond James", "And then just a follow-up. It's sounding like when I hear you that visibility of your business the last couple of quarters is actually much better than it was in a more normalized environment going back a few years. Is that pretty accurate or\u2026? Cause you call out annual run rate, annual earnings run rate now, I think you\u2019ve done that for a couple of quarters in a row. Is that true or the visibility is still basically one quarter looking forward?", "David Aldrich", "", "I think the difference is, there is a difference, you mentioned going back a couple of years. There\u2019s a big difference in the last couple of years. One is that increasingly our business, our products are customized to either a base pan solution or an OEM solution, some cases both. So what we see today is we\u2019re getting designed in much, much earlier in the chip set and architecture solution decision, which means that once we\u2019ve won an order, we\u2019ve won it; once we\u2019ve won a socket, we\u2019ve won it and it goes the life cycle of that, in this case, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a base pan solution, a base pan chip set or a customer OEM platform.", "So if you go back a couple, three years ago you had a situation where many of the 2G systems were dual-sourced and so there could be an opportunity to win and lose business based on phone refreshes. The only way we lose or win business today is on a platform or on a complete base pan refresh. So once we\u2019re in we\u2019re in, and the only trick then is to be able to accurately forecast what our customers, how many phones our customers are going to ship. Because we absolutely know the share we\u2019ve got \u2013 we absolutely know it. It doesn't shift, it doesn't change throughout the life of the program. That\u2019s a big, big difference.", "The other difference is that our non-handset business that was mostly component-driven a couple of years ago, today it tends to be more custom IC driven into these verticals and then into our analog components business. So those programs again, like the handset example, rather than being commodities sold to a discount channel they\u2019re customized into a solution, whether it\u2019s a base station or an energy management device, or a CATV modem. So it\u2019s the difference between a custom analog business and a component business. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Anthony Stoss with Craig Hallum.", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum", "", "Hi guys. If you wouldn't mind commenting about a higher percent, kind of 2G versus 3G. Also what percent you send over to AWS or how much you utilize them in the quarter. And give us a sense of your CAPEX needs maybe this quarter and next. Thanks.", "Don Palette", "", "Hi Anthony, this is Don. The mix for the quarter, we\u2019re now slightly more than half 3G versus 2G. We were 52% 3G and 48% 2G. Your other question on CAPEX \u2013 I would anticipate it\u2019s going to be a level that you\u2019ve seen in the past few quarters, in the $20 million to $25 million range. We don\u2019t guide cash flow but that\u2019s a number that is not out of the realm of possibilities for us.", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum", "Then AWS? Was that about the same, at 15% of production?", "Don Palette", "Yeah, that number runs 15% to 20%. It\u2019s in that range.", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig-Hallum", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Cody Acree with Williams Financial Group. ", "Cody Acree \u2013 Williams Financial Group", "Hi guys, great quarter. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve got this far in and no one has mentioned inventories. How are things looking within the channel and internal?", "David Aldrich", "", "You broke up, Cody, the last sentence. You want inventories in the channel and what?", "Cody Acree \u2013 Williams Financial Group", "And internal.", "David Aldrich", "", "Okay. Well, our inventory turns internally have remained very consistent. They\u2019re up a bit so we continue to reduce our cycle times and work the inventory turns, so those -- I think they\u2019re higher than anybody in the space. Our inventory turns run in the high 5 to 6 turns, and that\u2019s quite good in our environment. Externally, you know, remember, Cody, that much more than half of our revenue today now is going either to a hub or to a stocking distributor where we have complete visibility into sell in versus sell through. So one thing we can say for the majority of our business is that there really is no opportunity to see a glut of inventory build because we simply replenish that which is drawn down and used and consumed in manufacturing by our customers. That\u2019s the nature of these hub contracts.", "So we don\u2019t worry about component inventory builds or our stuff sitting on a shelf somewhere. Now there\u2019s a broader end market question, but in terms of the question you asked which is componentry, we have lean inventory in the distribution channel and no excess inventory in any of the hubs.", "Cody Acree \u2013 Williams Financial Group", "And how about that end market visibility?", "David Aldrich", "", "Well, the end market visibility is quite good among our major customers. The area that Liam referred to, in China where the visibility gets a little bit more choppy. There\u2019s been some OEM share shifts, there\u2019s been some build up and take down as the governments tried to pushed back on some of the gray market and reduce perhaps the number, the growing number of OEMs shipping into that gray market. So we did see some impact there, we factored that into our guidance. So that\u2019s where the visibility is lowest. It\u2019s quite good elsewhere.", "Cody Acree \u2013 Williams Financial Group", "Great. And then lastly, with this new structural product mix change, not relying quite so much on the handsets, how does this affect seasonality?", "Liam Griffin", "", "Well, it should for the most part offset the typical handset seasonality. So you see more annuity-like growth with these complex analog, mixed signal, vertical market portfolios.", "Cody Acree \u2013 Williams Financial Group", "", "If you had to go into a range of quarterly weighs, how does this look first half, second half, Q1 to Q2? What should we expect going forward?", "Liam Griffin", "", "Well yeah, we really, it\u2019s difficult to try to triangulate that. Certainly I think we\u2019re all pretty familiar with the types of ramps and seasonality you see in the consumer handset-oriented markets \u2013 you know, a better September and December and then some softening in March. The non-handset business doesn\u2019t exhibit that, so for the most part you can see steady growth. You know, March may be down a touch there but certainly it will offset to some degree the seasonal declines that you see in consumer handsets. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Nathan Johnson with Pacific Crest.", "Nathan Johnson \u2013 Pacific Crest", "I may have missed it, but did you guys say what percentage of revenue came from the linear business this quarter? And just, I guess to dig in a little further, how do you anticipate that percentage to be in the September quarter and then in fiscal 2011?", "Don Palette", "", "Hi, Nathan, this is Don. For Q3 our analog business remained in the 20% to 25% range, which it\u2019s been in the last multiple quarters. Handset revenue was in the 75% to 80% range. We wouldn't expect that percentage to change in the Q4. 2011, we\u2019ve spoke before about our overall goal and our strategy is to continue to expand our analog business. We\u2019re going to be focused on moving that percentage as we move into 2011. ", "Keep in mind, all the financial models that we\u2019ve talked through and the performance to date has been with that analog business being 20% to 25% annual return. So as we\u2019re successful moving that percentage forward, you know that's going to be an overall impact to the business model as well.", "David Aldrich", "", "This is Dave, and I also think we should point out that even within that 20% to 25% or 75% to 80% on the handset side, it really masks a big shift within the handset sector, which is we\u2019re moving pretty dramatically away from the 2G segment more towards 3G. We\u2019re seeing more 4G, more multi mode and highly integrated solutions with more content. So I think it\u2019s almost a little bit of a disservice to think of it as an 80/20, that\u2019s true, or 75/25, but there\u2019s a big shift going on within that 75% to 80%, which we are benefiting from a lot. So we like the growth in the smartphone segment, the 3G and 4G segment, and we are quite comfortable with while we\u2019re growing aggressively in the non handset business, we\u2019re going to grow the handset business just as fast here in the short run, but we\u2019re going to see that underlying shift which helps our margins a lot.", "Nathan Johnson \u2013 Pacific Crest", "And then I guess expanding on the 4G discussion, can you just remind us for a typical 4G handset, what that looks like in terms of additional dollar content for you guys? I mean is it equivalent to just another 3G band or is there some other dynamic there?", "Liam Griffin", "", "Yeah, absolutely. Well typically when you start to port LTE into a device, and we\u2019re seeing it now. We mentioned on the call that we just launched the first commercial LTE device, which is really in the form of a USB dongle provided by Samsung. That is a great model for what you may see. Now that device has an Edge FEM, several WCDMA bands and actually three LTE bands. So quite a bit of content. We\u2019re now looking at customers that are thinking about 2011, 2012 with as many as six different discrete devices that Skyworks can provide \u2013 two or three LTE, two or three WCDMA. So it is going to be a material gain in content for us and it\u2019s also you know, quite a challenge in terms of complexity and performance.", "And those attributes, the content, the value that you derive and the performance and the requirements that actually limit some of the competitors, it\u2019s a perfect intersection for us.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll next go to Aalok Shah with DA Davidson. ", "Aalok Shah \u2013 DA Davidson", "", "Hey guts, just a quick clarification question. You guys have talked about smart meters for quite a bit of time now and I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how big that business really is for you guys. Can you give a range of how big that business is and what you think the potential is?", "David Aldrich", "", "Yeah, it\u2019s been the fastest growing segment in our non-handset business. It\u2019s right now about 20% of our non-handset business. And you\u2019re right \u2013 we think that is a great example of where we were able to identify an underserved market, try to de-embed with applications and system engineering and support where we could go in and add value to our customers. We\u2019re trying to superimpose that model to now a number of verticals. So you\u2019ll hear us not only talking about energy management, but as today we talked about home automation, we\u2019re doing the same thing in network infrastructure, wireless infrastructure and broadband communication. So we do like to talk about it in the context of a successful penetration of a vertical market where the margins are quite high, and we want to see increasingly a lot of those at Skyworks.", "Aalok Shah \u2013 DA Davidson", "", "And then one other quick question on, just a follow-up on Nokia. Have you guys started to see incremental new platform wins at Nokia or is it kind of the wins that you\u2019ve seen over the last six months starting to come to fruition?", "Liam Griffin", "", "Actually right now we are gaining share with multiple platforms. You know, we\u2019re one of the few vendors that is aligned with each and every one of Nokia\u2019s baseband partners \u2013 Broadcom, STE, Qualcomm even. So we have a great relationship with each and every one of the baseband partners and a great relationship with the OEM itself. So you see today design wins that had been in queue for awhile, there\u2019s several new programs that are going to ship in September and in December, and through 2011 and 2012 we\u2019ll continue to grow in that account.", "David Aldrich", "", "And we believe that between now and 2011 that you\u2019ll see us participating in a low, medium, high end of Nokia's business, and that has not been the case in the past. So we\u2019re really thrilled with the platform penetration at Nokia.", "Operator", "", "We do have a follow-up with Tim Luke at Barclays Capital. ", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hello?", "Operator", "", "Go ahead, Tim. You may have to pick up your handset.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Sorry. Thank you so much. With your cash generation that you've been seeing, how should we think about your strategy going forward? Will we continue to look to you to pay down that balance of the debt? Do you see opportunities for share buybacks going forward? And eventually, Dave, do you see opportunities to add through to the portfolio in terms of smaller acquisitions? Thanks.", "Don Palette", "", "Tim, this is Don. Yeah, as far as how we look at our capital structure, absolutely those things are distinct possibilities as we go forward. We\u2019ve been very aggressive and successful paying our debt down over the past year and a half. We have $27 million left of the converts. Given where we are on the balance sheet with $390 million in cash and $315 million of net cash, we think that gives us a very strong competitive advantage. And we\u2019re always on an regular basis analyzing the capital structure, and clearly two of the possibilities are buying more debt and buying shares back. ", "And both of those, the payback to the company to do both of those are share price driven. So it\u2019s something that we see as an opportunity for equity appreciation. With that in mind, buying both those back at pretty high returns is obviously something, so it\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at on a very regular basis. And they are possibilities.", "Tim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Thank you so much, guys. ", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll next go to Quinn Bolton with Needham.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham", "Hi guys, I apologize if this has been asked \u2013 I came on late. But you guys talked about strength of smartphones and the LTE. I was just wondering if you look across the higher end of the design wins are you seeing a trend towards more modular solutions? I think some of you recent wins are actually PAD Plexor modules in the smaller areas. It looked like a lot of your LTE actually included the Duploxor. So I was just wondering if you\u2019re seeing a trend towards more highly integrated solutions as you get more bands or if there is still a good market for discreet PAs in some of these smartphone NLTE devices?", "Liam Griffin", "", "Here\u2019s the trend. The trend is towards you know, a great deal of complexity in the front end and that can be delivered discreetly. There are certainly customers and devices that are looking to get that more integrated. But I\u2019ll tell you lately the performance requirements have been so demanding, and what the consumer wants today in this handheld device has been just astounding. They want a tremendous performance, they want to download video. They\u2019re on social networking.", "And the challenge within these mobile platforms now has never greater. So with that said, what we\u2019re seeing now is a shift toward very powerful, discreet devices that bring in gallium arsenide technologies, which is something that we have in\u2013house, advanced multi-chip assembly and tasks, and just skill in D&A that Skyworks fortunately has under the hood here.", "David Aldrich", "", "It\u2019s really all over the map. There\u2019s a performance orientation. You see more discreet pans because they can be optimized at that frequency range for optimizing recurrent consumption and linearity and so on. And then in other areas we\u2019re seeing a great deal of push toward integration of multi bands and then pulling into switch-ring, filtering and so on. So we see it all over the map depending upon the segment of the market that it\u2019s being addressed.", "One thing that we\u2019re seeing though that has been quite consistent, is that even when they\u2019re looking to optimize performance - using a single band to optimize performance over a frequency - the bands themselves are being bundled within an overall system. So we\u2019re seeing less often an opportunity come in and say \u201cI'll take that band from you and that band from someone else.\u201d That\u2019s not what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re asking for a single switch that may do the control functionality for all the bands and logic that would control the transmit and receive functionality across all those bands. And even though they may go with discreet power amplifier, they\u2019re less and less apt to mix and match between suppliers. They need the overall system proven out, integrated, tested, and not have to worry abut trying to architecturally mess around with different suppliers.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "And our last follow-up with Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Parag Agarwal \u2013 UBS", "", "Hi guys. There has been some chatter about so-called adaptive power amplifiers or programmable power amplifiers. I just wanted to get your views on what, as to when you think this will become mainstream, and what you are doing on these new products.", "Dan Aldrich", "", "I\u2019m sorry, maybe you could repeat. I just didn\u2019t understand the question.", "Parag Agarwal \u2013 UBS", "", "One of your competitors have been talking about adaptive power amplifiers in the sense that they can be programmed to a particular frequency on the fly, ro you know, they\u2019re programmable power amplifiers. And the idea is that as we move to newer technologies or bands, instead of having four or five bands you can have just one power amplifier which can be tuned to a particular frequency. So just wondering\u2026", "David Aldrich", "", "Yeah, we have these configurable, adaptable power amplifiers that can be very broad band in frequency and they can be driven by the base pan and receiver to cover multiple bands and multiple modes. The problem, I would say the vast majority of what we\u2019re seeing today is that the base pan configuration - that is, the chipset ecosystem - is around a very specified front end architecture optimized for the freakiest and brands where they can configure it to go after their customer OEM base and provide adequate performance at each frequency band.", "So while we do see some push toward having broader band amplifiers and multi mode amplifiers, we absolutely do not see the case where an adaptive amplifier can be programmed and therefore you can take a PA and say, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you base pan guys\u2026 I don\u2019t need to work so closely with the base pan manufacturer. I can download software and then OEM can configure my PA to work.\u201d We see zero examples of that.", "Liam Griffin", "", "That type of technology is available here at Skyworks and we use it in infrastructure, broadband amplifiers in infrastructure. And in the cellular domain where the intricacies are known and there is so much focus on efficiency, right, and power that the strategy of developing a high performance discreet or an integrated device with a known frequency has been the way to go.", "David Aldrich", "", "We see zero forgiveness on current consumption, and the architecture you\u2019re talking about tends to have a trade-off on overall pace and availability. And we can do it, but frankly we see zero, zero opportunity for us to go with a customer that is more broadband but causes points in current consumption. We just don\u2019t see that as an option.", "Parag Agarwal \u2013 UBS", "That\u2019s all I have for you, guys. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "And with that there are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call to Dave Aldrich for any additional or closing comment.", "David Aldrich", "", "Well thank you so much for participating. That concludes our call today.

Please refer to our press release within the investor relations section of our company website for our complete reconciliation with GAAP.", "I will now turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "", "David Aldrich", "Thank you, Steve and welcome everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report today that Skyworks exceeded the upwardly revised fourth quarter outlook that we provided at our September analyst day meeting demonstrating solid execution and a strengthening competitive position.", "Specifically in the quarter, we delivered revenue of 313 million. That is up 14% sequentially and is up 37% year-over-year. We expanded our gross margins to 43.8%, and our operating margin to 26.1%. We improved our operating income by 92% year-over-year to 82 million and we posted $0.43 in earnings per share. We also strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter increasing our net cash position by 69 million and exiting the quarter now with 459 million in cash.", "Our strong fourth quarter results were driven by our mobile internet and our diversified analog growth edges. First, with regard to mobile internet, we are continuing to see increasing momentum given consumer\u2019s growing appetite for anytime, anywhere connectivity. And by all account global adaption of smart phones is happening at an accelerating pace, now at least 4 times the growth rate of the traditional cellular handset market. And to be sure that we benefited from the rising tide of increasing RF content associated with these band-intensive 3G and 4G platforms but more importantly as demonstrated by our more than 35% year-over-year growth rate, Skyworks is on an even steeper growth trajectory.", "The growth is being driven by: First, recent share gains stemming from our strong relationships spanning all leading smart phone and tablet OEMs. This is coupled with our technology leadership, our integration capabilities, and our scale advantages. At a higher level, there are a number of factors that are contributing to our growth in the mobile internet sector. To start, we are increasingly seeing multiple devices per subscriber. In fact AT&T is now projecting mobile penetration rates to reach 300% within the U.S. over the next 3 years. This means three mobile devices for every man, every woman and every child in the United States by the year 2014.", "And this growth will be fuelled by a host of new devices above and beyond traditional cellular handsets and even above and beyond smart phones encompassing high resolution tablets, USB modems, home networks and still yet to be introduced internet connective devices. Proliferation of these devices within the U.S. represents we think only the tip of the iceberg as compared with the substantially larger global opportunity as the developing world becomes even more connected.", "Further, the move to 4G represents a significant market expansion opportunity for us. Verizon recently announced that it would have LTE service in 38 cities this year and operators throughout the world are announcing plans to rapidly follow suit. By early 2011, we expect to see a host of LTE capable USB modems, tablets and smart phones.", "As this next wave approaches, Skyworks has a clear early mover advantage having powered not only the world\u2019s first commercialized LTE USB modem but also the very first LTE-based phone on the market. And finally, we are solidly out in front of the rapidly emerging tablet segment where we are seeing exponential growth. The applications are seemingly limitless today and these platforms are enabling entirely new usage models, everything from e-health, to replacing textbooks, to watching high definition football game on direct TV Sunday Ticket to-go.", "Early tablet adaption rates continue to exceed expectations and we conservatively estimate this market can surpass 200 million units by the year 2014, creating an incremental billion dollars of addressable market for us. You see these RF content rich devices rival and in some cases they exceed the dollar content in high end smart phones and here again Skyworks maintains a clear market leadership position having shipped over 4 million units into tablet applications in the fourth quarter alone.", "In parallel we are gaining traction on the network infrastructure side of the mobile internet connection. As operators install new base stations, new routers, and back haul equipment to expand coverage of data services, alleviate capacity bottlenecks and prepare for next generation LTE deployments. Consumer demands for anytime anywhere internet access is creating exiting new growth avenues for wireless carriers who in turn are making significant new investments in their networks to support wider adaption of these very lucrative services.", "According to a recent InStat mobile internet group research report, infrastructure expenditures by mobile operators will need to scale up by more than 40% in the coming years to meet this fast approaching demand. At the same time operators in emerging markets like China, like India are in the early stages of 3G build ups and are spending aggressively to roll out service for the first time on a nationwide basis.", "Both of these trends are creating a tremendous opportunity funnel for Skyworks and to support these upgrade we have developed a multitude of infrastructure solutions including attenuators, synthesizers, mixers, LNAs, to modulators.", "And I think importantly, our portfolio is moving away from component level offerings towards highly customized, highly performance driven modules that command higher rates as fees and create more formidable competitive barriers.", "And specifically during the quarter, we increased our share at HUAWEI and ZTE with our family of high performance broadband synthesizers and system at a package solutions spanning ultra wide frequency ranges. We captured design wins in support of Cisco\u2019s fiber to the curve and fiber to the home applications. And we now support Ericson\u2019s 4G and LTE-based station platforms with new digital attenuators and low noise amplifiers.", "So in short global penetration of the mobile internet entails upgrade to both existing client devices as well as to the supporting network infrastructure. And Skyworks is well positioned to capitalize on these twin mega trends.", "Okay, having covered mobile internet let us turn our attention to the diversified analog market.", "Some examples that we have highlighted in the past have centered on the energy management markets which continue to trend very positively for us particularly with our recent entry into LED streetlight monitoring and control applications.", "But today, I would like to spend just a couple of minutes focusing on a complimentary ecosystem that we believe holds significant potential for Skyworks which we will refer to as home networking and automation. This product area extends several of our smart energy solutions into the home and enables connectivity across a range of products including gaming consoles, set top boxes, printers, appliances, HDTVs, Blu-ray players as well as remote home security and monitoring systems. And these new class of enabling wireless device requires high data rates, requires extended network range, and a reliable radio signal performance. This plays directly into Skyworks\u2019 strength.", "And in this area during the quarter, we secured a key design win as part of Cisco\u2019s Scientific Atlanta cable set top boxes and Linx\u2019s branded home wireless audio and video monitoring systems. And we ramped this part of Microsoft\u2019s next generation X-box 360 and we also captured design wins on a forth coming IP-based television platform.", "Given all of the revenue drivers that we have discussed, we are entering FY 2011 poised to ", "demonstrably outpace industry growth, (underpinned) by our design win momentum, by a product pipeline and by scale advantages. Operationally speaking, Skyworks is making strides towards a new midterm operating model targeted at 30%.", "So in summary, we believe that our strategy of diversifying across new vertical markets and diversifying our customer base while continuously improving operational execution will translate into above market growth, greater operating leverage, and increasing shareholder value.", "I\u2019ll now turn this call over to Don for his financial review.", "", "Donald Palette", "Thanks, Dave and thanks again for joining us, everyone. I will first provide a quick summary of our fourth fiscal quarter results and then outline our business outlook. Revenue for the period was $313.3 million, up 37% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, versus our updated guidance of 310 million.", "Gross profit was $137.3 million or 43.8% of revenue, a 290 basis point year-over-year expansion which was driven by a product mix that increasingly includes higher-margin vertical market in 3G solutions, volume ramp of new products, margin enhancing demand driven capital investments, continued manufacturing productivity enhancements and product end and yield improvements.", "Operating expenses were 55.5 million, of which R&D was 33.5 million and SG&A was $22 million, yielding $81.8 million of operating income and a 26.1% operating margin, a 750 basis point improvement year-over-year.", "Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was 400,000 of expense, while cash taxes were 2.7 million. As a result our net income was $78.8 million, or $0.43 of diluted earnings per share versus our guidance of $0.40.", "I did want to point out that we recognize the $0.02 per share benefit associated with lower than expected taxes in the quarter. Excluding this benefit our fourth quarter earnings per share would have been $0.41.", "Turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter we increased our net cash position by 69 million sequentially driven by 82 million in operating income, recorded 12 million of depreciation and invested 29 million in capital expenditures. As a result we exited the quarter with 459 million of cash and cash equivalent.", "Having completed the six-inch capacity expansion in our Newbury Park fab last year, we have strategically focused our more recent CapEx investments on expanding our assembly and test capabilities in support of our improving outlook and high visibility. These back end investments come from our 6 inch wafer transition and hybrid outsourcing model and are focused on equipment adds to eliminate internal bottle necks. Importantly and inversely all cases we anticipate these investments to payback within the fiscal year, while expanding margins and improving our return on invested capital.", "Now to our business outlook:  Based on specific program ramps and backlog coverage, we are forecasting current quarter revenue of 330 to 335 million, gross margin expansion to roughly 44.5% and operating expenses of approximately $57 million, yielding a 27 to 28% non-GAAP operating margin, which is squarely on track to our previously outlined medium-term operating model target. Below the line we expect 200,000 of net interest and other expense and incidentally we anticipate paying off our 50 million credit facility this period further deleveraging our balance sheet. This repayment will be an accretive use of cash given that the rate on the facility is significantly higher than our earned interest rate.", "Also of note based on the implementation on a number of business initiatives we now believe that our cash tax rate for Q1 and for the remainder of fiscal year 2011 will be 9% as compared with our prior outlook for a 10% to 12% cash tax rate. As a result, we expect to increase our operational non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44 in the December quarter off a base of 187 million shares.", "Well, that concludes our prepared remarks and operator, let us go ahead and open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Absolutely. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) We will go first with Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Hi, thanks and guys, congratulations on good numbers and guide. I wanted to ask two things first. I know you are not giving guidance here on the March quarter but given all the momentum we are seeing in the business, how would you think we need to think about seasonality for you guys in the March quarter? And second, on looking at your accounts receivables and inventories, this is the first time in four-five years that we have seen both actually grow into September quarter. Historically, there has been flat if not down \u2013 can you give us a little bit more color into that?", "David Aldrich", "", "Hi, Ittai. Thank you. The strength we are seeing today as you know as we have said in the prepared comments is being heavily influenced by demand in the mobile internet and we talked about some new programs that are ramping for us outside of handsets in energy management home motivations and networking products. So, for us, we think that there will certainly be seasonality in margin and most people take that to be 8, 9, 10%. I don\u2019t see any reason to forecast anything different than that and we hope to be able to outperform that given the specific program ramps we talked about.", "Donald Palette", "", "Hi, Ittai. This is Don. On the AR in the inventories both will be as lined items on the balance sheet are our director\u2019s volume during the quarter and anticipated future volumes so in the case of AR, it is ultra combination of sales being out and also the linear areas tails that affects what the balance is at the end of each quarter. Our DSO versus in this quarter versus any of the prior quarters this time of year is consistent with what has been. It is not a velocity issue of collections. And on inventory, I turned it actually off from where they have been on prior periods so it is strictly a volume issue.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Was the linearity in this quarter any different than in the past?", "Donald Palette", "Slightly, but it is enough \u2013 it is really volume and a little bit of linearity but again, the DSO is consistent with what has been in the past.", "Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Very good. Good luck, guys.", "David Aldrich", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "", "Thanks for taking the question and nice job once again on the results, guys. I am not sure if this is for Don or Dave but as you look at the outlook and think about the underlying businesses, can you help us understand some of the gives and takes across the handset business, linear products, etc?", "David Aldrich", "Thank you. This is Dave. Maybe I can help you with this. I would say that clearly in the mobile internet spaced smart phones tablets and some of the feature-rich phones where we are benefitting from some of our chips and relationships we are seeing strong momentum there. And we are also seeing as we talked about some these energy management home automation. They are starting from the small base where we are seeing sequential growth there. We are seeing some choppiness clearly in China. We factored that into our guidance but we have seen some areas of softness in that part of the world. We have been monitoring our inventory levels both with distributors and very, very closely and there is no issue there. There is no inventory overhead anywhere that we can see. As you probably know almost half of our revenue now goes through this consigned hubs that we have very, very good visibility in the component supplies. We don\u2019t think there is an inventory overhang anywhere in the channel that we could see in the mixed shakes throughout the way I described.", "Craig Ellis \u2013 Caris & Company", "And the handset comment \u2013 excuse me, the China comment was that handset infrastructure or both?", "David Aldrich", "", "It is really handset \u2013 actually we are seeing some nice strength in infrastructure. We talked about HUAWEI and ZTE, we won some system package of VCO/Synthesizer business there so our share of those two customers is expanding so it is really the well-publicized handset softening that we have been dealing with now for a few months.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will go next to Anthony Stoss with Craig Hallum Capital.", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig Hallum Capital", "", "Hi, guys, also my compliments. Can you talk a little bit more about capacity on where you are at, how much more room you have or AWS has. Also, kind of lead times on what percent might be put to your guidance. Thanks.", "David Aldrich", "Sure. And Anthony we will talk a little bit about capacity. Right now, we believe we are well-positioned with our current capacity profile and our ability to meet customer demand. We will successfully increase our capacity over the last three to four quarters all of our internal fabs and our assembly and test operations. We will also continue to leverage the hybrid manufacturing model and with that leverage with this dual combination of expanding internal capacity preparing our suppliers to get rid of handling capacity. This will allow us to keep internal utilization high, leverage with external partners and with both of those things aimed at rose margin expansion and our return on investment capital expansion. That is the end result for us.", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig Hallum Capital", "Okay, the percent booked to your guide currently?", "David Aldrich", "", "Consistent with the way we typically do this forecast when you look at back log and you look at the hub hole forecast it is virtually 100%.", "Anthony Stoss \u2013 Craig Hallum Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thank you for taking my question. First on China \u2013 do you have better exposure or better flat rates to some of the basement ecosystems there that others and there is a little bit of a share shift price going on in that market. I just was just wondering how diversified you are across baseband ecosystems.", "Liam Griffin", "Jonathan, this is Liam. We are diversifying in sort of the immediate technical larger player and we have great position there. We have expanded which (inaudible) and smaller players like Mstar. So we will be diversified as much as possible across the basement partners. Another move that we are making now that you will are going to see the benefits of in 2011 is consorted effort to penetrate HUAWEI and ZTE more fully. Moving in the 3G Technology \u2013 they are basically in China right now. The lead players for 3G to are doing some great work with data cards as well as handsets and as Dave has alluded to our infrastructure opportunity in China looks very promising. We are starting to see strength now come together in our integrated package is not \u2013 I think that has a tremendous operation cycle worth coming in 2011.", "Jonathan Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "In a case of HUAWEI and ZTE handset business do you sell them directly now or does it go through distribution?", "Liam Griffin", "Directly. We sell directly there.", "Jonathan Goldberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Parag Agarwal \u2013 UBS", "", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get the idea of your design and momentum in the sense that I mean \u2013 I just wanted to get a feel of (inaudible) is going to shape out based on your current designing and based on your designing momentum. Like now, do you feel that you are getting share at your existing customers?", "Liam Griffin", "", "I think really the good news in the transformation of our business over the last few years has been it has moved so far away from many commoditized business like the old 2G days when there was an opportunity to win a design and then have to reoffer or recompete for that design. Today it is all around pretty highly customized solutions with our chips and partners going at specific statements or specific OEMs and so we know what we wanted and we know where we are positioned and I think one thing that is very, very unique about us is that we are in production with all OEMs and all smart phone manufacturer. We have relationships and volume with all of the major baseband providers in the world \u2013 all of them. So I think at the market as we describe at our analyst day and then prepared comments for smart phones, for tablets and the overall handset market is going to be strong. It is going to be shifting again away from the low end, low performance towards future phones and the high end. That is a clear shift that will continue and we have decreased our share in each one of those segments going in 2011 versus where we are at 2010. We are very confident of that because it is kind of something you do not launch a phone in 2011 unless you are working in that ecosystem 18 months ago.", "Parag Agarwal \u2013 UBS", "", "Okay. Don, if you look at the gross margin how should we think about incremental gross margin going forward to 2011 and also how is the offers going to trend?", "Donald Pallete", "", "Okay, again we do not guide out beyond the current quarter but the way to think of it I think is related to the business model target that we have at 30% return. With that model works to the minimum of 45%, we have a higher goal on that internally but clearly if you think in terms as revenues continues to ramp and we continue to focus on initiatives we have in place and we continue to get the higher dollar content, the higher margin that we are getting with the product shift that is going on with each segment, those are all going to be margin enhancers and will continue to drive margin forward to that minimum goal 45 which again makes that 30% model work with a higher goal internally to drive that number above that.", "Operator", "Thank you we will go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Co", "Quinn Bolton \u2013 Needham & Co.", "Hey, Dave, I just wanted to try and reconcile your comments about the inventory comment on the call there last night. Did they see a typical \u2013 bigger than typical seasonal build at the holidays? They sort of cautioned that they might have to work out of that margin on June. It does not feel like you are necessarily seeing the same things but just wondering if you could provide some additional comment?", "David Aldrich", "As I said, we are benefiting by the fact that we are in this hub arrangements with virtually all of our major customers and increasing now even with our linear product customers so the way those works is a work in the forecast that forecast is updating continuously but more importantly we are able to see into to their production volumes and how they pulling and drawing those lines. And so there really is no opportunity to have component build in inventory because we are watching it real time daily in fact. So we benefit from that and we do have our distribution businesses where you can get kind of caught up in and out of itself when we look at the turns for where every component with the distributors we have and we have gotten better over the year that really being able to question and challenge where we are seeing puts and takes on that inventory and we think that it is quite in control. So I would say that given what we know today we do not see any meaningful packets of inventory anywhere that I can point to.", "Quinn Bolton \u2013 Needham & Co.", "It sounds like that you are looking at from the component perspective, is that correct?", "David Aldrich", "That is correct.", "", "Quinn Bolton \u2013 Needham & Co.", "", "Do you have any view into the retail channel for mobile phone that might be the difference?", "Liam Griffin", "Yeah, I know absolutely. This is Liam. We speak with our customers on a regular basis specifically let us say the top five major handsets OEMs and the larger smart phone players. We are having discussions with them weekly. We have very good visibility for the hub equation that David mentioned so that gives us in fact day by day inventory visibility and with respect to carrier inventory right now we feel like it is in balance.", "Operator", "We go next to Nathan Johnson with Pacific Crest Securities", "Nathan Johnson \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities ", "Yes, thanks for taking my question. I just want to talk a little bit on the competitive situation that one of your key competitors has been certainly talking quite a bit about the expectation per share gain (inaudible) their version of (inaudible) on 2011. I just want to get your guys\u2019 perspective on how important (inaudible) is going to be in 2011 and how Skyworks is addressing that particular setup and then secondly just as far coming back to the design link question given the amount of customization and it sounds like increasingly going this whole source, I was just curious \u2013 how far out you guys now are seeing design? Did you have a sense for the next six months? Do you have an idea of the designs you were into even beyond that or you could just try some color there?", "David Aldrich", "I think it varies from customer to customer. I would say for the most part we are competing for designs today that are in the 2012 timeframe. The 2011 designs have been in those ecosystems if you will. By ecosystem, I mean you know the front end provider working with the baseband chips set providers selling into either a broad channel to a reference design or into a specific OEM. I know the decisions have been made for (inaudible) production 2011. So the visibility is quite good of how our position and in answering the question about how important it is if we would just look at (inaudible) you need because we do shift to all the OEMs and we are on all the baseband platforms not every baseband platform but all the baseband partners. Major baseband suppliers use our chipsets. So we are able to get a good sense where the market is directing or it is moving and it really is the case typically for 2011-2012. It depends. We have customers who are using very performance-oriented, quite discreet solution because they are very concerned with the overall high \u2013 keeping the high absolute performance. Those designs are quite discreet. At the other end of this spectrum there are customers and there have been partners driving a multimode hybrid but different approaches \u2013very different approaches, different technical architectures around what that multimode would look like. Not different as to what they will do but how they will be architected in the system and then there are a number of customers who are somewhere in between our code hybrid \u2013 some discreet elements to gain performance of certain specific bands and for certain markets and then coupling others in highly integrated call of multimode if you will so it is an important solution. It is one of several and we have very good visibility in to what customer want and we actually follow our customers\u2019 lead and we work very closely with our partners to make sure that the technological solution we provide is competitive and we are very, very competitive across the discreet solution \u2013 the hybrid solution of multimode.", "", "Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more different on how you expect your (inaudible) to differ from the empowered (inaudible)?", "David Aldrich", "I think that there are different technical approaches to how one might implement the chipset itself but let us be clear. The architecture that this various converge platforms are going after had been set, the foot prints has been set, the current consumption goals had been set, the power and the efficiency has been set, the all of the said set of systems specification are designed and known and we are meeting and or exceeding those system specifications in the architecture and our cost structure is lower than anybody. We are convinced to that for a lot of reasons so I think we are extremely competitive relatives to the system specs that our customers or partners need.", "Nathan Johnson \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities ", "Let me just add that you know every customer is given access and visibility to each one of the technologies that David mentioned fully converged a hybrid or discreet and really the way this pendulum works is the more discreet implementation the better performance. You literally build a device for a specific frequency and a specific band rather than comprising in a converged environment. I can tell you that customers today the most compelling OEMs and smart phones and tablets, these data rich devices that we mentioned is a performance driven market. It is performance driven market. We can go in any one of the three boxes but what we were seeing now is a prevailing view that has been go performance. Give me the values solution but it needs to be a high performance and that is leading more towards hybrid or discreet.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will go next to Tore Svanberg for Stifel Nicolaus.", "Eric \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks, guys for taking the question this is Eric calling in for Tore. Maybe you could just elaborate a little more the (inaudible) integrated product we just discussed now. If you could talk a bit about the performance of your solution and perhaps give some customer feedback to date any known issues. That will be helpful.  ", "David Aldrich", "The customer feedback has been extraordinarily good. Extraordinarily good. These devices are complicated. They are being implemented in different architectural approaches. At the end of the day, the customer does not care to the extent that it meets its size, performance cost and system specifications. And so we look at the marked key customers who we think that can be either early adapters or drive volumes of those products. We believe we have the best solution in the industry. And we are getting that feedback from our baseband partners. We are getting that feedback from major customers.", "Eric \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, that is helpful. Maybe just two quick ones, could you give the split between the linear and the handset business and then maybe just comment on where the yields are and cycle times based on the similar commentary you gave last month or the end September 30 during your analyst data? It would be helpful, thanks.", "David Aldrich", "I heard the split between the handset and linear is consistent from where it is been for the last several quarters 80% handset, 20% linear. One of the points I wanted to make on that is that we talked a lot about that our linear product business. The margin are created with the overall business and that is certainly true but one of the things that I wanted to point out is that we have had some pretty strong growth factors in the handset business and we have been able to that linear product percentage is not moving a lot being fairly consistent flat for the last multiple quarters. We still have been able to consistently grow and expand our product margins and our operating margins and that is a direct result of the mix that you are seeing within linear products and within handset as well and we just guided a 700-point margin improvement. So just want to make that point that the core products within each of those segments \u2013 the tide is rising on a margin (inaudible) to those.", "Eric \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "As a follow on with Donald\u2019s comments, with these multi-mode solutions the very first large customer going into high volume production will be early in 2011. The yields on those products and the margins on those products look very good. And to that we will be the first supplier in volume production with the multi-mode solution in the world and the yields looks very good on those products.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Richard Shannon with Northland Capital.", "Richard Shannon \u2013 Northland Securities", "Hi guys. Once again congratulation to very nice numbers. My first question I guess is on the pricing environment. It seems like this year been a fairly good pricing environment relative to your historical norms. You have talked about the transition from more discreet solutions to customized modules going forward. I would love to get your thoughts on how the pricing environments flushing out for next year is going to be more like what you see in past years or more like what you see on 2010 or how do you see that playing out?", "Liam Griffin", "Chard, this is Liam. Yeah, the pricing environment has been not well balanced so far, nothing unusual. What we are seeing as I mentioned earlier is what we really liked about this market today is there is so many opportunities for us to differentiate and deliver solutions using creative architectures. Again, playing off with our performance theme so we believe that we are going to see devices going to 2011 quite a bit different than what we are shaping out in 2010. A lot more integration in some cases. There are some higher performance devices in market like LTE. There you can have very significant ASPs but also provide great performance and great value to the customers. So I would think 2011 would work a little bit like 2010 and maybe more favorable from these perspective.", "Richard Shannon \u2013 Northland Securities", "Okay, great. Second question, you talked about some great growth drivers in both in your wireless and your linear product group there is. As you see today, 2011, any sense of which group would either one grow faster or mature faster than the other or they look both kind of in a similar growth range?", "David Aldrich", "They have been both growing similarly which is a testament to the strength of (inaudible) in your product. I think you have probably seen that the diversified in locked market has been struggling a little bit with overall top line growth rate. That has not been the case with us. Part of it is because we are relatively new to some of the vertical market we discussed in our prepared comments so the starting for small base then grow trajectory quite high in energy management network infrastructure and so on. So that is the case and you will see that even within our handset business \u2013 that handset business now is queuing so heavily towards smart phones, towards tablets, towards very featured rich products and the ASP with those products is very high in the margin profile is different better. And so it is a very different market. Our (inaudible) business is becoming more customed. I see vertical market driven in less component like and our handset business is becoming much more customed solution oriented around high value, high performance. We are offering our customers a great deal of functionality for the dollar which puts much pressure on the ASP.", "Operator", "Thank you. We are going next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Thank you very. Dave, can you give us some idea, I mean given that you have the historical breakdown with Finland in your handset. Did you know that it has given a lot of ground that Nokia recently and then of course your number one customer (inaudible) has done well. Is it safe to say that the business from your top two customers is more than 30% of total revenue?", "David Aldrich", "Yeah. The top 10 percentage costumers \u2013 they are the same as the previous quarter with Nokia, Samsung and (inaudible).", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "But even if you combined those three are we talking 15% of total revenue, 35%, 40%?", "David Aldrich", "We do not break those percentages down. The only time we do any percentages, anybody who is 10% or exact numbers when we do the (inaudible) on an annual basis. But quarterly Ed, we do not provide that detail.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "I know and that why I was asking for the color. Okay. On the converged side of the business, as you know I may commit a big deal of winning some flaws as limited to (inaudible) and I know we tried chatting about this in the past. It appears that several people are technically having difficulty with the truly converged PA. Is this informed maybe your trust in a more discreet hybrid solutions or while trying to get to hear in your discussion with the OEMs given some of the difficulty, the technical difficulty that people are getting solutions to work. Is this coloring their move or deployed road map that maybe use hybrids up to the 3, maybe in 4 band level for some of the converged or smart phones or do you think this all going to fall by the wayside in the next 18 months and that will make a much bigger push to the more truly converged amplifiers that we are using right now?", "David Aldrich", "It is a lot of questions there but I appreciate it. I believe that these converged platforms will play. They will get the technical issue resolved. They are very complicated. But they will work. They will take longer to get to market than most people projected because that is often the case with new technology. I am also convinced that it will be a market that becomes segmented around different technological solutions. We are now developing product to per customer baseband specification for 2012, 2013 that are very much a hybrid single bands of LTE around some degree of hybrid converged type platform but not completely converged and there are others that will drive towards a more highly integrated. And the trade-off will be performance versus cost versus cost in size. And market will settle into different issues. I think we will utilize one architectural approach versus another so we are very, very agnostic. For us it is we are equally investing in whatever flavor our customer wants and today our customers\u2019 talking to somebody who addresses all of them. They want all of the above. Literally, all of the above.", "Operator", "Thank you. And once again it is star 1 for questions. We are next to Cody Acree with Williams Financial.", "Cody Acree \u2013 Williams Financial Group", "Thanks and congrats on the numbers. If you look through 11 and 12 and a little further out, significant drivers to verticals (inaudible) maintain but the new inputs have not been seen in the years past. How do you expect as we head into 2012 your vertical mix to start to shake out on a product basis or maybe on a (inaudible) basis?", "David Aldrich", "I think on a product basis, it will be a product line that is most highly integrated. There will be more silicon content, there will be more frequency conversion, functionality, more complicated devices, a little bit less of the jelly bean components that maybe - launched us into the catalogue business a few years ago. Still a great business but I think that is where the growth will come from. And it will come from the areas we discussed in the prepared comments.", "Liam Griffin", "Yeah. I think one of the dynamics that we do see in vertical is that every market can converge into wireless in every year so we are seeing things like smart energy 2, 3 years back was a wire line business. The wire line (inaudible) we mentioned some things like LED streetlights monitoring, home automation, security, surveillance, things like that. All of those markets now are kind of coming in on tangents off of our smart energy core. We are also now giving (inaudible) working in wireless infrastructure again. Not only interesting but we can deliver now but looking at ways to expand our (inaudible) in our camp. So I think you are going to hear more about specific segments as well as discreet new vertical market.", "Cody Acree \u2013 Williams Financial Group", "Great. And Liam, I guess following onto that, what is the competitive dynamic differentials in the new vertical versus maybe where you used to compete on the more discreet 2 to 3G (inaudible)?", "Liam Griffin", "Yeah. I mean that is a great question. We see a whole different customer set when we look at these protocols now. It is as David mentioned that there is still heavily silicon-based technology. We are using creative designs to try to create a better mouse trap so to speak. So we cannot just go in and blow away components. We look at systems, highly system level packages here. Thing we have done with (inaudible) are perfect examples where we going to grade 6 to 7 components to deliver a very high valued, high performance solution that puts up tremendous various entries. So that is going to be the theme around our protocol position. And so is (inaudible), try to deliver something differently but also take advantage of our technical T&A.", "Operator", "Thank you and with that we have no further question in queue.

We repurchased approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock, and we still improved our net cash position by $41 million. ", "Looking forward, we are guiding to in excess of 30% revenue year-over-year growth in the March quarter, reflecting substantially better than normal seasonality. This is positioning us for accelerating earnings growth as we enter the second half of the fiscal year.", "In the December quarter, we continued to benefit from strong underlying demand in the mobile Internet, enhanced by ongoing share gains and by new product ramps. Consumer appetite for anytime, anywhere connectivity continues to grow exponentially. In fact, 2010 holiday sales underscore the strong demand for Internet-connected mobile devices that provide always-on access to social networking sites, gaming, video, music and Web access. Retailers have highlighted mobile devices as a bright spot in consumer spending this past holiday season, and we've certainly benefited from this demand. Clearly, adoption of smart phones is happening at an accelerated pace. With a growth rate of at least 4x that of the traditional cellular handset market, these devices represent a compelling value proposition across the supply chain.", "Our customers are experiencing brisk sales and keep raising the bar in terms of performance and in terms of capability. And consumers are lining up to get the latest models, and carriers are eagerly pushing and promoting these devices into consumers' hands as expanding mobile data revenues contribute to improving ARPU. Skyworks is in a unique position to capitalize on these healthy market dynamics, based on our unique product offering and our broad customer base. Our products support all smart phone and tablet operating systems including Android, Symbian, Windows Mobile and others.", "What's more is we believe that the momentum we have seen with 3G-enabled mobile devices will only accelerate with the commercial launch of 4G networks. While 3G exposed consumers to the concept of untethering the Internet, 4G will provide users a truly mobile broadband experience, with speeds rivaling those of the wired Internet. In fact, forecasts suggest that in the coming years, growth in global broadband subscriptions will be dominated by growth in mobile Internet subscribers. By its very nature, 4G is a technology that was developed to provide ultra-high-speed data rates and stream video. And in fact, for many consumers, 4Gs may be their only broadband connection.", "And what's especially exciting here at Skyworks is that 4G devices operate on a new and unique set of frequency bands beyond 2G and 3G, providing an incremental dollar content opportunity and expanding our total available market for years to come.", "This year's Consumer Electronics Show provided a preview of the pending wave of 4G products that will come to market over the course of 2011, and the rate of availability of these devices exceeding all our expectations. As an example, Verizon, which has already launched its commercial LTE service, plans to add 140 new markets in 2011, and they've recently announced a roster of Skyworks-enabled LTE devices, including smart phones, including tablets and mobile hotspots. Likewise, AT&T is accelerating its own LTE plans, and now intends to service initial markets later this year, along with 20 LTE devices over the course of 2011. ", "As this next technology wave approaches, Skyworks has a clear early mover advantage, having already powered not only the world's first commercialized LTE USB modem, but also the first LTE-based phone on the market. Some recent examples of Skyworks' position include the DROID BIONIC, an Android-based LTE smart phone that was unveiled at CES by Motorola. We have also secured design sockets with HTC's EVO and Desire 4G platforms. These design wins complement our already well-established position across other LTE suppliers and platforms. ", "So in addition to smart phones, we expect to see 4G connectivity getting embedded into tablets during the second half of 2011. And by combining the mobility of a smart phone with the performance and the processing power of a network PC, tablets are fundamentally changing the computing landscape. These devices have found a unique niche within the consumer electronics market and provide an ideal platform for mobile video applications.", "And we see mobile video as an exciting and enabling trend for Skyworks, not just within tablets but across a broad array of technology platforms. Content providers like Netflix and others are keenly focused on providing streaming IP video service to gaming consoles, to high-definition televisions, to Blu-Ray players and set-top boxes, as well as smart phones and tablets. Keep in mind, video delivery consumes a significant amount of network bandwidth and drives up performance requirements on RF architectures, and this plays squarely into Skyworks' technical strengths. And future developments will only add more of the same, including high-definition and eventually 3D video streaming, and will only serve to raise the performance requirement for these devices.", "Importantly for us, these macro trends are in the early stages of playing out. Smart phones in fact accounted for only about 20% of mobile device shipments in 2010, and we believe that smart phones could account for more than 50% global unit shipments by the year 2014. Now if you add to this, the tablet market is expected to grow at nearly 80% compounded rate over the next four years, so something less than 20 million units in 2010 to as many as 200 million units by the year 2014. All in all, we see a long runway today for these positive macro trends to continue.", "So given our momentum and the multi-year revenue drivers that we've discussed, we will enter the second half of 2011 poised to outpace the industry and the market growth, underpinned by new design wins, by strong product pipeline and by our scale advantages.  So in summary, we believe that our strategy of diversifying across new vertical markets and new customers, while continuously driving operational execution, will translate not only to above-market growth but greater operating leverage and ultimately increasing shareholder returns. ", "I'll now turn this over to Don for his financial review and outlook.", "Donald Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us, everyone. I will first provide a quick summary of our first fiscal quarter results and then outline our business outlook. ", "Revenue for the period was $335 million, up 37% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.  Gross profit was $149.9 million or 44.7% of revenue, a 250 basis point year-over-year expansion which was driven by an improving product mix, supply chain efficiencies, margin-enhancing, demand-driven capital investments, and continued manufacturing productivity enhancements. Operating expenses were $57 million, of which R&D was $34.1 million and SG&A was $22.9 million, yielding $92.8 million of operating income and a 27.7% operating margin, a 640 basis point improvement year-over-year.", "Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was $278,000 of expense, while cash taxes were $7.9 million, which is an 8.5% tax rate. As a result, our net income was $84.7 million or $0.45 of diluted earnings per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter, we invested $33 million in capital expenditures and back-end process investments, which complement our hybrid outsourcing model. As a reminder in virtually all cases, we anticipate these investments to pay back within the fiscal year while expanding margins and improving our return on invested capital. ", "We also recorded $13.6 million of depreciation. We retired our $50 million credit facility, part of our broader strategy to reduce debt, and repurchased approximately 800,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $23.15 per share. As a result, our balance sheet is now virtually debt-free, and we still increased our net cash by $41 million and exited the quarter with over $450 million of cash and cash equivalents.", "These improvements highlight the progress we've made in our broader strategy to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet. As a reflection of this, over the last three years, we've improved our balance sheet from a negative $46 million net debt position to a positive $426 million net cash position. ", "Now to our business outlook. Based on specific program ramps and backlog coverage, we are forecasting current quarter revenue of $310 million to $320 million. Assuming the midpoint of this guidance range, we suggest modeling gross margin of 43.8% and operating expenses of approximately $57.5 million to $58 million.", "Below the line, we expect $300,000 of net interest and other expense. We expect our cash tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2011 to be 8.5%. In turn, we expect our operational non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $0.39 in the seasonally low March quarter, off of a base of 190 million shares. ", "Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, go ahead and open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "I know you mentioned the Bionic for you and 4G. But Motorola also is refreshing along other lines, and I know had the Atrix at CES and the Xoom tablet. Can you talk about Motorola as an account and what\u2019s happening even within the 3G segments for you?", "Donald Palette", "Liam?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, sure. Alex, this is Liam. Yes, Motorola continues to be a very important customer for Skyworks. Fortunately, their strategy now has been to go very deep in smart phones, which happened to be quite content-rich for Skyworks. So we are seeing ourselves line up with Motorola across a number of new platforms, some supported by Qualcomm, some supported by Infineon, typically Android-based. And we think the content gains that we're seeing now from Motorola look good, and hopefully, their unit volumes as they projected in 2011 will really accelerate the demand. So we think Motorola is going to be a grower for us in 2011.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "And if I could, as a follow-up along those lines, can you give any color around maybe average selling prices overall you're seeing on the RF deck, and maybe what the opportunities are in some of these 3G and 4Gs with regards to average selling price bias?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, the content -- we think about selling price, we think about the content we can derive from these smart phones. I mean, typically, we are seeing our 2G and EDGE-based products that could be $1 to $2 now move to $3, $4, $5 that we derive from more content in smart phones. And when we start to look at these devices that we've talked about with Motorola, with HTC and some others, they are incredibly rich in content, multiple bands, high-speed data, capitalizing on all of that media, that wireless IP that Dave articulated. So we are seeing that content per phone move into the $4 to $5 mark per device.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Suji De Silva with ThinkEquity.", "Suji De Silva", "Can you help us understand at this point where your tablets are as a percent of revenues and what you think you\u2019ll be exiting '11? I know it's kind of early. And is that the biggest factor in guiding above seasonal for the March quarter?", "David Aldrich", "I would say that, it's clear if you look at the last year in 2010, tablets was a very small percentage of our revenue. I mean, a year ago, we weren't talking much about tablets. It's been sort of a natural extension of the smart phone phenomenon. I think that the growth rate and the pent-up demand for this class of device, the growth rate is going to be huge. We talked about in the prepared comments moving from perhaps less than 20 million devices in the year 2010, growing maybe as much as an 80% compounded rate. So it's a big growth rate, still a relatively small percentage of the total 1.3 billion, 1.4 billion units that are going to be sold in terms of cell phones and smart phones. So I think it's going to be a driver. We have disproportionate amount of content and we have a disproportionate amount of market share, giving the inherent complexity and the need for performance in these devices. So I think the market is going to be big, I think it's going to play out over the next several years, but starting from a small base.", "Suji De Silva", "Okay. And on the balance sheet, I think inventory was up more than revenues on a Q-over-Q basis. Can you talk about where do you think that's going to come out next quarter, and how you're managing that?", "Donald Palette", "Sure, Suji, this is Don. Yes, our balance was up this quarter. And it was really geared in order, the balance was built in order to support some specific customer program ramps we have for the second quarter. But the important point when you look at our inventory is it's not that the balance is up. I mean, if you look at our balance sheet historically, as our end market demand and revenue grow, we're going to grow working capital. That's just a function of the business. But our turns are still above 5.5 this quarter, and we consider those best-in-class when you look at our sector. So very strong, still performance on the inventory side for us, as far as the velocity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank", "First question, was your revenue or guidance impacted by any supply constraints of any other companies like displays of NAND Flash with the handset OEMs so that you could have shipped more if those constraints were not there?", "David Aldrich", "Okay. I would say that we have seen some certain component lead time stretch. We've seen some tightness in assembly, test and some of our wafer supply. We've taken steps to expand our internal capacity. Remind you we have a hybrid model that allows us to pull, in some critical processes, pull volume internally, and we've done that in some cases when we've needed to. It allows us to flex our own utilization as demand fluctuates. I would say, from component supply into Skyworks' modules, the answer to that would be no, but we were able to work through those. Now whether or not our customers could have shipped more, if there were other component shortages, products we didn't provide that truncated their ability to ship, I think there probably was some of that. But it didn't affect the supply chain into Skyworks' products.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, fair enough. Secondly, about your account receivables, they were up again this quarter. Just wondering what is the aging profile of that account receivable? And if any one of your customers have a higher than average concentration in that accounts receivable number?", "Donald Palette", "Parag, this is Don. The increase in receivables, when you look at that again, it's the comment on inventory, it's driven by our end demand and overall revenue increase. And our balance -- the increase in the balance this quarter was driven by a higher Q1 revenue and a combination of the customer linearity and customer mix, because we do, in fact, have different payment terms among customers. So based on that mix and when that mix occurs during the quarter, it does impact the overall velocity measures. But I want to step back and say, when you look at the improvements we've built in the balance sheet over the last two to three years in the business, and I take a look at the asset base both from an inventory standpoint and a receivables standpoint, it's as strong as it has ever been. So the quality of that asset growth is extremely good.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a quick housekeeping question first. Have you broken out linearity as a percentage of revenue?", "Donald Palette", "No, we haven't yet, Jonathan. The breakout is the mobile Internet access was roughly about 60% of our revenue, 2G-feature phones about 20%, and linear products roughly 20%.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then, Liam, I think a question for you. Could just talk a little bit about market dynamics you're seeing in China? How are your products faring there? How do you think your share is trending this quarter?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. Yes, I mean what we're seeing right now in China is that the 2G market is really going through some changes. The local manufacturers of the indigenous Chinese sources are really contracting. But at the same time, we're actually seeing some share gains from some of the traditional Tier 1s, Nokia, Samsung and others going back into China at the low end. So that's one of the dynamics. For us, we obviously approach China conservatively. We know there could be some volatility. But at the same time, we're doing quite well with companies like Huawei and ZTE in the infrastructure space. We're making progress now in data cards, 3G data cards. And jumping into Taiwan, we're seeing some really nice potential and new design wins at HTC.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "I wanted to focus on the sequential transition from December to March and compare and contrast it this year versus last. In last year, you managed to deliver a very well below seasonal pattern of down 2.9% sequential on the top line, and this year, you're guiding to double that, whereas this year, the tablet impact on your business is much more significant, and I would say versus probably immaterial last year. Also, Don, your gross margin is declining. Your guidance implies a declining gross margin into March, whereas last year, it increased. So, I mean, what's so different about the transition into the March quarter this year versus last year? My gut and my intuition would have told me it should have been at least on par on last year, if not better from a sequential movement.", "David Aldrich", "Well, okay. Let me try and answer multi-part question. Don can jump in on the latter half. We think that we're modeling market seasonality for March to be down 9% or 10%. That's what we see. We've guided to down about half of that, so much, much better than seasonality. With revenue, the year-over-year will be over 30% up or north of 30% up. So clearly there's a lot of share gains going on. And we like to guide conservatively. We guide for fully booked backlog, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're fully booked to deliver that range. And we think that, that's prudent. So I think that is clearly above the market. And you're right, we are seeing strength in these new program launches, but we do see the traditional business with a degree of market seasonality, and we wanted to factor all of those, all of that into our guidance.", "Donald Palette", "Yes, Ittai, this is Don on the revenue. Yes, if you go back to last year, we were essentially flat on the margin. But the revenue decline from Q1 to Q2 was a little bit less than it is this year. And we also, when you look at the change from Q1 to Q2 last year, we were also starting to get benefits from the six-inch ramp that are already embedded in the baseline overall margin of the company. So when you're looking at comparisons, there were some things going on that muted that revenue change. It was lower to begin with than what you're seeing this quarter, quarter-to-quarter. So that's really what's driving it. Just keep in mind on the margin front, margin expansion for us is still a key element for us to be able to get to 30%. So being down this quarter is based on the revenue decline, the seasonality and the mix that we have in there, and as we go forward in order to get to 30%, it's still going to be a combination of leveraging OpEx and continuing to drive margin expansion. That's what's going to happen to get us there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nathan Johnsen with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Nathan Johnsen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.", "Just wanted to talk a little bit more on smart phones, just clearly been doing well, high-end and developed markets, but certainly much has been made on the part of Android OEMs on lower tier smart phones. Wondering if you guys have seen much traction with those phones, particularly in emerging markets? Is that a meaningful part of revenue now? Or is that a potential growth driver that we should expect to happen in the future?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. I absolutely believe, this is Liam, that the emerging markets represents a significant upside opportunity for this industry. You look at a subscriber base today in China and India that's invariably holding a 2G phone that has maybe a dollar-based fee content for us. They will move up. Those subscribers want to move up. They want Internet access. They don't have DSL at home. They don't have cable at home. So a smart phone really represents their path to the Internet. So we are seeing some of our OEMs develop specific platforms to address those markets. They're platforms that may not have all the bells and whistles that you may see in the U.S., but still compelling. And all that for us is outstanding, because it moves our dial up substantially from our baseline, and we think there is tremendous growth opportunities there over the next several years.", "Nathan Johnsen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.", "And if I'm hearing you right, there's almost kind of none of that revenue in your run rate currently?", "Liam Griffin", "Oh, very minimal, yes, literally small numbers here. And some of our OEMs that we're working with right now are just starting to get those phones in the prototype stage and sampling stage with the carriers in China.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Co.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC", "First question, just back to the Analyst Day in the fall, you talked about the multimode, multiband platforms, I think go into production in the March quarter. Just wondering if you could provide an update whether that's still on track? And then a follow-up question is just, can you list the 10% customers in the quarter?", "David Aldrich", "Okay. The multimode, multiband designs, and keep in mind, Quinn, that there's a lot of different configurations. It's everything sort of a fully converged platform which is not going into production yet, but perhaps the most complex for a certain segment of the market, most likely the lower end of the market, to what's more prevalent, which is sort of a hybrid between certain discrete bands, while at the same time, more integrated amplifiers, switch and filter functionality, and then there are pure discrete designs. Because the different flavors of these multimode architectures are going into production will continue to roll out throughout 2011, 2012, and even some we\u2019re talking about now into 2013. So I think that trend is on track. I think the fully converged platforms, those are very complex, and there's a lot of moving parts with those. And so for that slice of the multimode market, we don't see that becoming a major driver here for some time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.", "Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital", "I was wondering if you could frame what you think the lift may be as you begin to see LTE come into the marketplace, and where do you see that beginning to get deployed? And when do you think it could become something that might be possibly material? Also separately I think from the prior question, if there was a -- just clarifying the 10% customers. I'm not sure if you gave that.", "Donald Palette", "I forgot to answer that. I'll go ahead and start with that, but the 10% customers for the quarter were Samsung, Nokia and Foxconn.", "Liam Griffin", "Tim, with respect to LTE, I mean, one of the important elements here, it's not just a new standard. It's a standard that runs on unique frequency bands as incremental RF content to the devices. So you will have devices, smart phones, and I think eventually, tablets will be a really important driver for LTE, where you will have LTE frequency bands 2.6 gig, 3.5 gig, backward-compatible to 3G, that could be three or four devices, and then even backward-compatible again to add your GSM. So it's an extension of bands and it's an extension of content. They run on discrete frequencies. So it's really an important part of the story. It will probably just get off the ground here in 2011. 2012 and 2013 could become a very significant driver for us.", "Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital", "If I may just to follow up on the general relationship with Nokia, could you just bring us up to speed with how that has been proceeding? And whether if you moved forward through this calendar year in general, you perceive a sort of broad adjustment in your customer mix and the ongoing broadening of it?", "Liam Griffin", "Well, with respect to Nokia, as we've articulated in the last few calls, we continue to make very good progress in diversifying and gaining share across that customer. We have a great position in 3G. We have recently extended that into GSM. Our position in EDGE is also solid. And we are trending towards steady market share gains throughout this year. And I think we have an opportunity to secure as much or as great, perhaps greater than 1/3 of their overall PA share.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Don, you've got quite a bit of balance sheet flexibility now. You used a little bit of that to finish out the debt pay-down and buy back some stock. But how should we think about the way you'll put excess cash to work going forward?", "Donald Palette", "Yes, absolutely, if you kind of look back over the last, since to the first quarter of 2009, over the last two years, we've actually improved the net cash position by about $310 million. So absolutely, with a strong balance sheet and the strong performance we've had on our financials, it gives us an awful lot of flexibility. You've seen to date that we've focused on taking the debt down. We're virtually debt-free. And we also initiated this quarter that we started to utilize the $200 million share buyback program that the board approved for us several quarters back. So we did that. We'll continue to buy shares selectively. We'll look at the right opportunities to do that. And we're virtually debt-free at this point. So what's left with the cash is to look at very selective M&A opportunities. And we've said this numerous times, we've very conservative on the M&A front. For us to do any acquisitions, they've got to be instantly accretive and they've got to drive shareholder value. That means expanding not only our operating margin and our EPS, but our return on invested capital, and we just don't want them to be a distraction to how well our overall business is running right now. And we will focus on accretive bolt-on acquisitions like Freescale and Axiom, as well as any analog niche opportunities that come along. So it's clearly something that we look at on a regular basis.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Okay, great. And then a lot of understandable focus on tablets so far. Liam, I don't think I've heard any comments on energy efficiency and automated meter readings, so can you bring us up-to-date in terms of the prospects for growth in that business this year?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, Craig, absolutely. Yes, the smart grid and the smart energy, and now the complementary home automation markets continue to move forward for us. They are very strategic with respect to our vertical initiatives. We've added a few critical customers, key customers that we had been pursuing. We're starting to see a little bit of improvements in Europe as well as the U.S. And we do expect the adoption to continue. The meters are rolling out, that's happening. We're starting to see now that peripheral market, the appliance makers, the LG, Whirlpool, GEs adopting ZigBee, in some cases, Wi-Fi, to tether back to those smart meters. So we definitely see this as a continued area of focus in our Linear business. It's good margin and it has legs here for the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.", "Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC", "Dave, this is probably directed to you. I'd love to hear your thoughts on capacity, what your plans are for the remainder of this year and into next year? And also give us a sense of what AWS [advanced wideband systems] is doing and how you feel, comfort level with that?", "David Aldrich", "Sure. So if you look at where we are today, we're outsourcing roughly 20% of our volume, if you were to combine assembly and test services with wafer foundry, gallium arsenide wafer foundry costs we outsource also. We, during the last six quarters or so, have completed a six-inch expansion of our HBT [heterojunction bipolar transistors] facility. We've added substantially to our pHEMT switch capability, and we've added a lot of the back-end assembly and test capabilities. So we have no bricks and mortar constraints, and we continue to incrementally add. But we've made the big bucket expansion in our foundries over the last six quarters, and the fact that we have a hybrid approach that allows us to flex our external partners allows us to take the revenue much higher, without having to deal with any material capacity constraints, although we'll continue to invest in bottlenecks in assembly and testing. At AWSC [Advanced Wireless Semiconductor Co.] and our other outsourced partners, they're doing terrific. It\u2019s a copy exact process. The quality meets our standards. We monitor them daily, weekly, hourly. And we're extremely happy with the performance of those partners.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Eric [ph] calling in for Tore. Real quick, just on what you talked about earlier, where do you see the overall handset market growth rate in 2011? And with today's news or comments out of Nokia pulling its XM smart phone out of the AT&T lineup, does that have any sort of impact on where you see the smart phone opportunities for you guys with Nokia?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. Well, we see 2011 in terms of handset units to be roughly 8% to 10% up. That does not include the tablet number, and it also doesn't include other embedded wireless applications. But I think what's important is we look at the unit number, but more important to us is the PAM number. So what is the available PAM that we see for amplifiers and switches in the devices that we can market and sell. We see that number going up 15% to 18% off of an 8% to 10% growth, by virtue of content gains.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. And real quickly on linearity in the quarter, can you maybe just address that? And was there any kind of late orders that you saw taking place?", "Donald Palette", "No, there wasn't anything specific or unusual that drove that. I mean, linearity in a quarter changes month-to-month in the forecast and it changes quarter-to-quarter and it changes year-to-year. So there wasn't really any specific dynamic to discuss that drove it. It was just the way the overall customer demand of when they needed the product and when we shipped and who those customers were, all of that ended up driving some impacts to the working capital, really nothing more complex than that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Shannon with Northland Capital Markets.", "Richard Shannon - Northland Securities Inc.", "I guess, first question, kind of another way to ask one of the previous ones, which at Analyst Day here a few months back, you talked about an operating model, I think it was $375 million to $400 million per quarter, and suggested that, that time frame for achieving that might be later in the calendar 2011. Is that still very much your plan? Has your confidence on that increased since that time frame? Any thoughts on that, please?", "Donald Palette", "Yes. Well, Richard, the way to think of that, and it would have been, I think, pretty clear when we've communicated the new mid-term model is that, in order to achieve it, we needed the $375 million to $400 million per quarter as you mentioned. And historically, if you look back at the three times we've put mid-term models, communicated those externally, we've achieved those within four to six quarters. So that's the way to think about that.", "David Aldrich", "If you look at what we just delivered in the December quarter was just under 28% operating income. And so we remain very comfortable with that model.", "Richard Shannon - Northland Securities Inc.", "Okay, great. Appreciate that. And then second thing just on the pricing trends you're seeing in your base handset business. How have those trended? I presume they're coming downwards on some sort of trend. Has that trend kind of continued what you've seen in the past year or so? Or has that moderated some, like down less? Or how has that been recently?", "Liam Griffin", "The pricing environment, right now, actually we feel is in line with our expectations. The demand profile has been pretty good for the industry. One of the things that we do here is we really capitalize on complexity, and we turn our portfolio over very quickly at Skyworks. So there's a lot of new technology being deployed to the market, which really helps insulate us from some of that typical commoditized ASP curve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "First off, Nokia is now above 10%. You guys are doing fairly well there. I think it's generally understood that the delay in the platform that you're on, which is now shipping, gave RF Micro a much bigger share in past years. They\u2019re actually not even on Lynco [ph] and you guys have got that. Do you see this going back the other way in the year or so as Nokia tries to balance up their supply chain? Or do we have a fundamental shift at Nokia, where they're going to achieve a more balanced approach to suppliers, maybe 30% each for an office, you and RF Micro. I know they probably don't lay it out that way but I'm just trying to get your feelings on how you think the dynamic there works? And then I had a question on converge.", "Liam Griffin", "Okay. Ed, I'll take the Nokia question. Ed, our position at Nokia continues to be really solid, and I understand the platform discussion that you noted. Right now we're seeing continued growth in share gains as we articulated I think with another caller. So our position in Nokia now is we're marching steadily towards achieving at least 1/3 of their share of PAs. We've created the diversification that we need across multiple baseband partners across 3G, EDGE, and now GSM. We don't see anything sliding back. We've worked closely with that customer for a great deal of time. We've executed incredibly well from a supply chain point of view, from a technology point of view. We think our position is looking great.", "David Aldrich", "Ed, could you repeat the -- you mentioned something about converge?", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Yes, I had a follow-up. But before I get off that, Liam, what you just said then, are those share gains generally because Lynco [ph] is ramping and you're on Lynco [ph] and they're porting it to more phones, or are you winding up on other platforms, too?", "Liam Griffin", "Oh, yes, absolutely. Lynco [ph] is a very small piece of Nokia's converge in 3G architecture right now. It's going to grow, but that's a small element. I think if you look at the overall volume, there's tremendous volume still in their traditional 3G. Some of the newer platforms they're going to launch this year, as well as EDGE and GSM. So it's well-balanced. We're diversified. If a platform moves away from us here or there, that's fine. But the position is diversified and looking strong going forward.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "And then on the converge, Don, you pointed out that -- no, Liam, you said that 8% to 10% in unit volumes but you're looking at 15% to maybe 20% or 18% on content. But as converge picks up, I mean RF Micro's got Power Smart out there. And I know it's not really ramping yet but it will be. And I think the pricing philosophy is to undercut a four- band phone for a price of a three. So at some point, and I know the OEMs are talking about trying to get some of the dollars that are flowing to the RF band someplace else and doing that to converge. So the question is, to the extent that converge has become successful, but when we start seeing content become compressed a bit?", "David Aldrich", "Well, I think that the way to look at this, Ed, is that there will be multiple architectures, and when you talk about converge, there will be different architectures within converge, different approaches within converge. And then there will be hybrid approaches for higher performance aimed at perhaps a certain band or frequency or network. And then there will be various degrees of more discrete that will go into tablets and other higher-end smart phones, where they really need performance across multiple bands and frequencies. And so you are right that the beauty of converge in these various approaches is that we can sweep more functionality into a smaller footprint, do it in a way that conserves battery talk time, and do it in a price point that allows the build material to go down into the phone OEM's handset lineup. So the way I view converge long-term is that it's going to enable a build material price point that's going to eat into the mid-tier and ultimately low end of the market. I personally believe, as we said in our prepared comments, that smart phones go from less than 20% to 1/2 of the market. They do so by penetrating what we might call emerging markets or large untapped markets where we can take a product that today may only have $1 of Skyworks content and triple the TAM. That will be $8 or $10, but that's not the point. The point is the blended ASP will go way up as these converge and other architectures allow a build material price point. The performance won't be as good as a hybrid, it won't be as good, but it will facilitate the penetration of smart phones much deeper into the phone OEM's lineup and that's going to be tremendously good for our industry.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "On the Linear business, Don, can you give us a sense of what the seasonality of that business looks like? And is that having an impact in your gross margin guidance for Q1 or for the March quarter and are we seeing a little bit of a seasonal downtick in Q1 for the Linear business?", "David Aldrich", "No, not particularly. The Linear business looks very strong. The energy management, some of this home network business we talked about in our prepared comments looks really good. It's a little bit further out but the early stages are being placed now and you can see a little bit of that going into the March quarter. But I think, as Don has articulated, our gross margin is nothing more than, we're forecasting less than seasonality, but some seasonality in traditional business and that revenue as it flexes has a certain contribution associated with it. So the gross margin will be high, but it will tick down slightly from December as you would expect when revenue drops a little bit.", "Donald Palette", "And another way to think of that is, the guidance of $315 million is almost dead on to Q4 actual of $313 million, and we were at $43.8 million. So this isn't any real erosion of what the performance was two quarters ago, so you really need to keep in that context, I think, when you look at the numbers, too.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "How much networking business is in Linear do you think, like the traditional guys, like Cisco and Juniper?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes. Actually, most of our networking businesses is in the cellular infrastructure space, companies like Huawei, ZTE, Nokia, Siemens, Ericsson. But it's an interesting question because we do have aspirations here, and we think we have the technology and the DNA to start to move into the backhaul and potentially the wire line accounts here over the next few years. So there's right now, today, Cisco, Juniper, very little. There is some Wi-Fi business with Cisco, not very significant. But over time, I think the work that we've been able to do in the cellular infrastructure market positioned us well to kind of move into more of the wire line side.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Aldrich, I'll turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.", "David Aldrich", "Okay, well, thank you, and thank you, everyone, for participating.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks Second Fiscal Quarter 2011 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich; Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today\u2019s call with a business overview, followed by Don\u2019s financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may materially differ and adversely differ from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP. I'll now turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David Aldrich", "Thank you, Steve, and welcome to our second fiscal quarter 2011 earnings call. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of execution by the Skyworks team. Our financial results for the March quarter exceeded our prior guidance and significantly outpaced normal seasonal trends. In fact, our sequential revenue performance demonstrates how a diversification strategy and growth in new market segments are contributing to stronger financial results for our shareholders. We fully expect momentum achieved in the first half will translate into further market share gains during the remainder of the fiscal year throughout fiscal 2012 and beyond.", "Of note in the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $325 million, this represents year-over-year growth of 37%, with a seasonal impact of only 3% versus normal March quarter seasonality of 10% to 15%. We reported strong returns with gross margins of 43.9% and an operating margin of 26.1%. We grew operating income by 74% to $85 million, and we are in $0.41 per share. Now that's $0.02 better than our prior guidance. And we continue to improve our balance sheet. We generated $92 million in cash flow from operations, and we exited the quarter with a cash balance of $504 million.", "As our second fiscal quarter results indicate, our strategy is working, our business fundamentals are improving and our opportunity set is growing. The mobile Internet and an expanding set of addressable analog market opportunities are fueling an exciting growth of pipeline for us. First, mobile computing, and ubiquitous broadband connectivity continued to be the key drivers of our business. Even in the normally slow post-holiday season period, sales of smartphones and tablets have remained brisk, driven by exciting new product launches and the early rollout of 4G devices. Incidentally globally, the adoption rate of smartphones continues to significantly outpace the growth in the overall handset market by at least 4x. And in fact, smartphones still account for only about 25% of global handset shipments. We firmly believe this figure could easily double by the year 2014.", "And at the same time, subscribers are increasingly carrying multiple mobile devices. I think tablets are terrific example of this. The tablet market is forecasted to grow at a 78% compounded rate over the next four years. From less than $20 million last year to $200 billion by 2014. Interestingly, tablets are becoming more than just a consumer discretionary purchase, as they are finding their way into enterprises and new vertical market segments like healthcare, like education, like retail. Demand has thus far, exceeded most market analysts' initial expectations, and early indications are that tablets represent an incremental purchase and more and more often, these devices come embedded in 3G and 4G connectivity.", "So whether we're talking about smartphones, tablets, eReaders, portable gaming platforms or any other mobile Internet devices, one trend is clear. wireless connectivity is becoming more widespread and RF complexity is increasing, and the dollar content for us is rising. Skyworks is clearly capitalizing on consumers' skyrocketing demand to be connected anywhere and anytime. Now I'd like to spend just a moment on exactly how we're gaining share and why we win. Skyworks leverages a long heritage of deep systems level integration to engage in collaborative and highly customized development programs with our customers. We help to solve increasingly complex RF design challenges and reduce the size, lower the build material cost and increase performance.", "Leveraging on R&D scale, we are strategically engaged with each and every leading handset, smartphone and tablet OEM, as well as all baseband providers. This is across the entire spectrum of products from discrete implementation to highly integrated multimode converged platforms. We've staked out a market-leading position with our broad portfolio of high performance front-end modules and discrete WCDMA and LTE devices. Similarly, we are currently in high-volume production with our converged multimode platforms and we expect to see an accelerating rate of adoption across our customer base during the second half of this fiscal year.", "Now at a higher level, Skyworks is agnostic to our customers' architectural choices. Whether it's a discrete design, a PA Duplexer, multimode or some variation of all of these. And instead, we remain focused on leveraging our scale advantages our technology leadership, our integration capabilities and our unique product breadth. And this enables us to stay broadly engaged across our customer base versus wagering on a single approach. And this strategy has served us well and it will enable us to continue to gain share in the years to come.", "Now as evidence of this and towards this end, during the quarter, we powered an entirely new lineup of android-based smartphones and tablets from HTC, which leveraged our highly integrated front-end solutions. Likewise we were designed into multiple new sockets in key Samsung Galaxy smartphone platforms. We introduced a new family of antenna switch modules supporting a host of multimode smartphones, tablets and data cards. ", "Further we expanded our support of next generation Qualcomm MSM reference designs encompassing now WCDMA and LTE applications. And finally, we were honored to be the first semiconductor company ever to receive the 2010 best quality award from Samsung. This award recognizes Skyworks' excellence in overall product quality and our supply chain efficiency.", "This activity is reflection of the significant traction our mobile Internet business is gaining as we head into 2012. Okay now, switching gears for a moment, our linear products area continues to grow in near lockstep with our Mobile Internet business. And of course, this is dramatically outpacing the broader analog market growth. And now here, we are leveraging our catalog of precision analog products to address a broad variety of markets, including automotive, avionics, satellite, medical, military and industrial. And with our global customer base, it is now over 2,500 analog products, we continue to bolster our portfolio with each and every new product launches and each new customer engagement.", "We've successfully leveraged our growing and profitable Catalog Component business in the high-performance solutions from vertical markets as well like cellular infrastructure, like wireless networking and smart energy and home automation. These vertical market applications further increase our diversification, it deepen our level of customer engagements and help improve our margin profile. ", "And some recent example design activity here, we secured analog design wins with STMicroelectronics for their next generation IP television chipset reference design. We ramped production of precision analog IC supporting enterprise access points, cable set-top boxes and wireless video systems for Motorola and Cisco, among others. And without supporting General Dynamics with high-powered switching solutions for military land mobile radios. And we captured multiple infrastructure sockets with Ericsson, Huawei and ZTE for complex WCDMA base station transceivers.", "And finally a quick comment on Japan, our team has been actively engaged across all levels of the supply chain, and I think has done an excellent and outstanding job of ensuring business continuity. And while uncertainties obviously still remain in this area, we currently do not foresee any supply-chain impact. Of course, we'll continue to closely monitor the situation and we'll keep you posted if anything should materially change.", "So in closing, our second fiscal quarter was another strong one for Skyworks and the second half of fiscal 2011 is shaping up to be even more exciting. We believe that our strategy of diversifying across baseband partners, among OEM customers and new vertical markets while continuously improving operational execution is clearly working. Given the multiyear revenue drivers we've discussed, along with a design win momentum, our expanding customer base and new market opportunities, we intend to demonstrably outpace industry growth and not only the second half of 2011, but throughout 2012 and beyond. I'll now turn this over to Don for his financial review and outlook.", "Donald Palette", "Well thanks, Dave. And thanks again for joining us everyone. I will first provide a quick summary of our second fiscal quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the third fiscal quarter. ", "Revenue for the period was $325 million, up 37% year-over-year and ahead of our guidance for $310 million to $320 million. Gross profit was $142.9 million or 43.9% of revenue, a 160 basis point year-over-year expansion. Operating expenses were $57.9 million, in line with our prior outlook. R&D for the quarter was $35.2 million and SG&A was $22.7 million yielding $84.9 million of operating income and a 26.1% operating margin. That's a 560 basis-point improvement over the prior year.", "Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was $200,000 of expense, while cash taxes were $5.9 million, resulting in a 7% tax rate. As a result, our net income was $78.7 million or $0.41 of diluted earnings per share versus our guidance of $0.38 to $0.40. Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow, we generated $92 million in cash flow from operations and that's attributable to our strong operating results and second quarter collections. ", "We invested $32 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, reflecting process investments to complement our existing assembly and test capacity. We anticipate these investments to pay back within the fiscal year and improve our return on invested capital. I would point out that we have completed the majority of our capacity investments in Mexicali, and we anticipate that CapEx will begin to moderate back towards maintenance level over the next couple of quarters.", "Depreciation for the second quarter was $14.3 million, and we ended the quarter nearly debt-free with a cash balance of $504 million. These improvements highlight the progress we've made in our broader strategy to strengthen our balance sheet. Now to our business outlook. ", "Based on our broad customer base, diversification in the new markets and share gains, we are forecasting current quarter revenue to be approximately $345 million. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin of 44.5% to 45% with operating expenses of roughly $60 million. Below the line, we expect $200,000 of net interest and other expense and we now plan on our cash tax rate for the remainder of fiscal year 2011 to be 7%.", "In turn, we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $0.46 off of a base of 192 million shares. And finally, I would like to point out that our third quarter guidance puts us squarely on a path to approach a $1.5 billion revenue run rate with $2 in annualized EPS by the end of this fiscal year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we'll open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank", "First question is about your guidance and outlook for the market. If you look at that guidance of many of the baseband players and some of your competitors, June quarter guidance for these guys have been kind of muted to down. But your guidance is pretty strong. So just -- if you can explain what are the moving parts herein from what your vantage point? Can you explain what is happening in the market?", "David Aldrich", "Thank you. And I think the easiest answer is that it is a function of a very strong backlog, so our visibility is quite good right now. And that visibility is being driven by very specific program ramps. So both within our linear products segment, as well as smartphone, tablet and some feature phone launches. We've been able to continue to take some share of those program launches are happening as we speak. So that's helping us, help us to offset the seasonality of margin. I think it's helping us to power through the second half with above market growth rates.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And there have been some speculation about your content or your status with one of your leading customers. I know you cannot talk about that customer, but could you talk about the design pipeline as you see now and your confidence in your second half of the year outlook?", "David Aldrich", "Thank you. As I've said, the visibility is quite good and it's driven by that design pipeline. And as I think our track record reflects, we consistently win more than our fair share of new designs. I'm proud of the team's ability to continue to do that. And in fact, we gained points of market share in the first half of 2011. We're on track to do that with designs already in place. We're on track to do that again in the second half and we believe we'll grow 2012 beyond yield growth rate of the market. And as Don stated, we're now on a path to approach $1.5 billion revenue towards the end of this year, and $2 in annualized EPS. We're quite comfortable in our ability to do that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alex Gana with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "David I think you answered that question pretty well but let me ask in a different way around investor concerns. I believe they're centered around some of these leading smartphones as we see, UMTS and CDMA converging. There's been some arguments put out there that if your heritage in the UMTS band, and some of your rivals may be coming at some new approaches in the CDMA band that maybe it's easier for some of these CDMA players to encroach on your GSM track record or UTMS track record, versus the other way around? Is there any truth in that argument or that concern?", "David Aldrich", "Well, keep in mind that we've always been a major player in CDMA. Our heritage goes back over a decade. So we are very strong in CDMA. In fact, I'll remind you, particularly, a lot of people have forgotten, sometimes we want to forget that we were a pretty major player in transceiver development for CDMA as well as GSM. And so we have a strong systems heritage, we understand those implementations. And so if you look at the architectures and the way they're panning out today, there's everything from performance oriented discretes to power amplifier duplexers to converged per se, let's say the mid to low end of the smartphone market, and we're involved volume production each and every one of those. So we try to be, and we're successful in being completely agnostic with respect to architectural approach. We partner with all the baseband folks, we sell to all the OEMs, whether they'd be smartphones or tablets. And so that gives us a good sense for the overall market, and it implies that we have not only a breadth of engagement with those customers and baseband partners, but we have the building blocks, the scale to confidently go ahead with all of those. So we really don't get too hung up on which architectural approach, because we made those investments.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "And as a related follow-up on that, I know you're very clear in the second half, you expect your pace of growth to exceed that of the market. What about your building materials within some of the leading smartphone designs? Is that going up? Is that really the driver? Or is it more of the share gains?", "Donald Palette", "It's both. The build material average continues to go up. I think we've mentioned in the prepared comments that this year, roughly a quarter of the phones delivered our smartphone in nature, we think that number doubles in the next few years. That's a huge driver to the overall blended dollar content in our business. So while a 2G phone is still a buck, we are seeing a disproportionate amount of phones converting to an EDGE device with two bands, it's on a CDMA 3, 4, bolting on LTE so in general, the blended ASP across the market continues to rise.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Nathan Johnsen with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Nathan Johnsen - Pacific Crest Securities", "I just want to come back a little bit on the questions surrounding architecture. Obviously, one of your key competitors has kind of a critical platform change from their perspective. I wanted to see what Skyworks' view on converged solutions in 2011? How much of a place do you think they have in the market and does Skyworks expect to ship any fully converged solutions in 2011? And then secondly, clearly, Nokia has been an area of growth for you guys over the last few quarters, but a lot of moving parts there. Just wanted to see if you guys still view that as a potential growth area or if kind of the share gains are being overshadowed by some of the weakness that they're seeing there.", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, this is Liam. Let me take the first part of your question, then we can talk about Nokia. Well first of all, we are in production today with converged platforms. We're shipping them now, we have several customers that should be ramping by the end of the fiscal year. Multiple products, multiple platforms, so that's a given. And one of the things that we like to do with our converged platforms is as Dave mentioned, take a real customer agnostic approach, who address each account and each base band provider with the tools and the technology, the DNA that they like. And then deliver a collaborative solution around that platform. So that's going quite well for us. Your point about where the market is going, the market today is very different. Each customer has different preferences, there are some that favor a lower cost, lesser performance architecture, maybe fully converged, but there are hybrids where maybe you converge a couple of bands and have discrete WCDMA, and then there are complete full on discrete solutions that are out there. And our ability to cover all is in place, we have the customers set, the relationships to go about our business in the way that our customers favor.", "David Aldrich", "If may add one of the things that we're finding and I think it's longterm going to be very good for us, is I had mentioned that we are addressing all OEMs in the intersection point of those OEMs with the various baseband partners out there. And what we're finding is that the competitive base, I think out of necessity, has become more niche-y. They're competent obviously, but they're more niche-y. So a competitive may be very deeply engaged with a baseband provider, and then and there, it's their handset of customers, some with another baseband provider. We simply don't do it that way. So when you hear folks talking about a converged platform and a flavor of a converged platform, that's fine, we compete there. They're good, we're good. But that's not the way the market's going, the market is going very customer specific, very custom. And so we believe we have the scale and the breadth and greater than anybody in the industry today, that would address those and address that complexity.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "I just wanted to follow up, David, on your comments regarding HTC. It sounds like there's some nice share gain. Can you comment on what percent of your business you think you have, and what could that grow to over time?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure Craig, this is Liam. HTC is an account right now that's developing quite well for us. We are very much in the early innings with this customer. Difficult to handicap share but I'll tell you that we have a lot of room to grow here. They're a company that is enabling very content rich devices in smartphones, they have some great tablets and we're well positioned. Of course these are all higher end 3G and in some cases, LTE platforms.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "That's helpful, Liam. And then David, regarding the confidence in outgrowing the market in fiscal '11 and fiscal '12, I understood that to be both the linear products and the more of a power amplifier front-end module statement but can you clarify that? And any further comments on that will be helpful.", "David Aldrich", "Okay, sure. We put a lot -- the short answer is yes. We put a lot of our investment in applications, systems, know-how and design to continue to address not only the Component business within our Precision Analog business but also, more of these vertical markets that have very high gross margin, their long product life cycles, like that business a lot. So what we model, what Don talked about the second half of that $1.5 billion run rate, and what we've done in the past, model -- our midterm financial model, we made the assumption that the growth rate is similar for each product line, and we are continuing to do so. And we've had that experience now going on three years.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.", "Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital", "With respect to the outlook, could you give some color on your perception of how you see the tablet market evolving and what it may mean for you given your position? It seems as an important supply there. And Don, in seeing the revenue ramp, could you just sort of give us some feel further about how you see the profile of your gross margins developing going forward? And then maybe lastly, Dave, could you just balance the growth that you're seeing in the device side and smartphones relative to the linear business?", "Liam Griffin", "Tim, this is Liam, yes let me start with tablets. Clearly, we're very bullish on that market as Dave articulated. We think it's really the fastest growth area in mobile today. Our base position there is quite good, it's quite strong. Tablets tend to be content rich, performance oriented architecture, which is just what we do best here. I think you're going to see more entrants here over the next several years. We are engaged with everyone in that space, just to tell you that. We are working with each and every player. And we feel very bullish about that and that will be one of the growth drivers for us in 2012 for sure.", "David Aldrich", "And that's where you'll see LTE. We think the penetration the highest, so there'll be additional bands. And there'll be more of an eye towards performance and there is trying to squeeze the next $0.10 out of the build materials. So we think it does stay more hybrid, more discrete. With respect to linear products, versus front-end solutions growth, again, as I stated, we think we can grow those business roughly equally. And that's really good for the overall margin structure of our company.", "Donald Palette", "And Tim, you asked a question on the margins, too. Absolutely we still see opportunities for margin expansion. Just as a refresher to keep in mind, when we announced our midterm target model back in September, part of that was continued margin expansion, as well as leveraging our operating expense. That we just guided to a number between 44.5% to 45%. That model assumes 45%. So as revenue continues to grow, we leveraged the hybrid manufacturing model, you combine that with the focus we have on the CapEx investments that they're going to drive, productivity and margin expansion and all those things combined are going to bend a higher dollar content with a more complex RF devices that are going in the phones today. All that's going to continue to allow us to have an opportunity to expand margin as revenue grows. That's clearly part of the story for us.", "Operator", "We'll go next to George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.", "George Iwanyc - CIBC", "Don, following up on your margin comments right now, can you give us an idea of what the operating margin target was and what sales level you are expecting to have to reach that level?", "Donald Palette", "Sure, George. Again we announced that at the Analyst Day in September and we said that at $375 million, to $400 million of quarterly revenue, we were going to deliver 30% OI. So that was the range. Keep in mind, we've done that multiple times. When we set targets, we typically achieve those targets in four to six quarters, so stay tuned.", "George Iwanyc - CIBC", "Okay. And Dave, could you give us an update on how you approach the filter part of the front end and what are the big advantages and disadvantages in your approach to sourcing filters?", "David Aldrich", "I think that's a great question. I would say, I've been around this business a long time, and what we found in the past is whenever there is a change in architecture, for example, right now, there's movement in exactly, which bands of WCDMA are going to be combined, how they're going to be combined with bands at LTE, how discrete versus integrated it's going to be. And whenever there are those kinds of changes like that, we're in the early days when analog went to digital, it creates some disruption of filter technology, there's a bit of a scramble. You saw our guys who typically done a good job of moving up in frequency and performance while keeping the costs low. But over time, once those architectural shifts settle down, the very high volume filter companies, typically out of Japan, have been able to drive volume and commoditize the pricing of that segment. That's happened every time there's been a change. And so our strategy keep in mind, is to be vertically integrated where the technology is unavailable in emerging market, and a partner with the best of breed for those who make versus buy. In the case of filters we have partnered with the very best filters suppliers, we are aligned with the desire to address this market with the best-in-class devices. And I believe that, that's the right strategy. I think over time, by the way, incidentally, we're in very high volume production of filter-enabled pads and designs today. We're winning sockets that are enabled with filters and without. And so I think the strategy of partnering with the best, and allowing those very big filter providers to drive pricing down over time, will serve us well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG", "I was wondering if you could give us an update on your manufacturing utilization, how you're doing -- well how much you're doing in-house versus outsourced? And just give us an update on that strategy.", "Donald Palette", "Sure, Jonathan. And we've each talked about this before. And when we look at utilization, it's really two numbers that are important. It's sort of the equipment line utilization, which we consistently run a theoretical capacity then it sort of, you look at the facility utilization. And so you're looking at your usage of the factory and the square footage. And so for us, that's still a number where we have the opportunity with very specific reasonable CapEx investments to put those in and to get very, very quick payback to give us a much better incremental margin answer because we're able to keep the utilization at a very high level and we're able to keep that balance between internal, external. The hybrid manufacturing model in line to give us that best margin and ROIC number. Typically, we were on and it varies based on the specific demand profile in the quarter. But we'll run about 20% wafers that we outsource and it's running 5% to 10% for assembly and test operations. That's typically what we see.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then just a quick housekeeping question, you talked about an annual run rate of $1.5 billion in revenue, is that fiscal or calendar?", "Donald Palette", "Well, the way to -- that $1.5 billion is a calendar number, it's a fiscal number. But the way to think about that number is to take our guidance that we just provided for the reasonable growth rate onto that number, and you annualize that, and that gives you a comfort level of $1.5 billion. That's the way to think about it.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sujee De Silva with ThinkEquity.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC", "Quick question for Dave or Liam. As customers try to put products in the market into newer platform, do they tend to lean toward trying to make it more integrated to reduce the complexity or more discrete and then move toward integrated, which of the two have you observed historically?", "David Aldrich", "I think we've observed both and everything in between. There's some cases where the platform is designed specifically around a chipset to be low cost for example, may not have many, many bands. The WCDMA, this is an example where they'll go converge and try to go converge early on, and others will say, no, this is a performance-oriented architecture. In fact, we're seeing customers who have gone converge or go in the other way. And that's a trend we're seeing right now. Kind of interesting one. Where they say \" Look, yes this works okay but you know what, for a few pennies more, a little bit more money, I can go at a much higher-performance design.\" So we're seeing customers go from discrete to hybrid to converge, and we're seeing the exact opposite. It is very different customer by customer.", "Liam Griffin", "And I think as you start to look at market like tablets where you're bolting on LTE bands, and really focusing on high-speed video and content rich applications. We are seeing the potential move back as Dave illustrated to. Even a hybrid approach where maybe a few bands were integrated, with several discrete LTE and WCDMA devices. But all of that points to more content and an RF-rich device.", "Donald Palette", "And the other thing that we're kind of excited about is the upgrade of some of the lowest dollar content is dual-band GSM. A lot of that is sold in places like China. And as there's a push by the carriers and consumers to upgrade to 3G, we think that will be an interesting area where they will be highly integrated, they won't be world phones, we'll have very many bands, they may use GSM receive side for example, so it's kind of interesting to watch that evolve. We really like the effect. Now those won't be $8 per phone, but I'll tell you, that will be a lot more than a dollar. 2x or 3x added, so we think that's a big, we think, under -- not very well understood TAM driver in our space over the next five years.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC", "And just a housekeeping questions for Don, what's the turn in the guidance, Don, and what are your top 10 customers?", "Donald Palette", "I'm sorry Sujee, did you say turns?", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC", "Turns, yes, in the guidance, your backlog coverage versus turns.", "Donald Palette", "Oh 100%. 100%", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC", "100% coverage right backlog coverage right?", "Donald Palette", "100%.  Top 10 customers for the quarter were Foxconn, Nokia and Samsung, which is consistent with what we had last quarter.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Cody Acree with Williams Financial.", "Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc.", "Back to the converged platform, you said you're now qualified in multiple basebands, are there any significant suppliers that you're not qualified into?", "David Aldrich", "No.", "Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc.", "Great. And then just on that, the performance versus maybe the cost and flexibility, what is typically the performance trade off that you're seeing in your products versus your discrete solutions?", "David Aldrich", "You mean between a multi-motor converged and discrete?", "Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc.", "Yes.", "David Aldrich", "Well it really kind of depends. The trade off is in linearity, power and efficiency, which translates into talk time, sometimes thermal characteristics of the device battery performance and data speed, download data speed. There's also areas around isolation, noise, it get a little bit more RF esoteric, but they're quite a bit harder to implement in a multimode design. And so if you keep in mind that a process technology like any process technology, let's get gallium arsenide, tend to be a bell curve across frequency. And let's say for example efficiency. So what you wind up with -- it maximizes at a certain frequency, and then rolls off the edges of that frequency band. The broader, the more bands or the broader the frequency range you ask and amplify to address, the more it's going to roll off, at the end to that. So if you optimize it at 1.5, it will roll off at 900 megahertz. So that is the trade off. So customers using converge have to just kind of try to center it where the phone will be used the most, and then they pay a price for bands that move away from that centered frequency. Some cases, the market's okay with that, which mean it will work great in your own territory, when you're running 3G, but then when you roam, it will be much worse. And in some markets, that's okay, in some that's not okay.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.", "Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC", "A lot of my questions were answered, however, can give us a breakdown between 3G and 2G, and also a percent was from the linear products groups? And then right after that David, you wouldn't mind just talking about given your capacity where you are right now, are you prevented from or do you have to walk away from anything currently?", "Donald Palette", "I'll just get those housekeeping questions, on the air interface for the quarter, we were -- 2G, we were roughly 25%, and EDGE WCDMA was roughly about 75%, which these percentages continue to reflect the upgrade cycle and the revenue segmentation mobile Internet access, we were roughly 60%, 2G feature phones 20% and linear products roughly 20%.", "David Aldrich", "And to answer the second part of the question, no we're not walking away from any business today, keep in mind, we successfully completed the 6-inch conversion in our HBT fab. We've increased our PM capability for switches and ASMs. We also partnered with or assembly pdf in HBT with others. They're doing copies that process for us. So the combination of our own capacity and their capacity, gives us a great deal on comfort as we look out over the next few years. If we don't have to do anything major in terms of bricks and mortar in our operations.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Dave, maybe you can explain this a little bit, a, can you tell us where you are with Nokia now, are you done with your ramp-up phase or are there more to go? And then b, in terms of kind of where you guys are really winning share, I mean I guess we're all a little confused with everyone else in the wireless space, kind of guiding down for Q2. I know there are share gains for you, but we're trying to -- I guess the reason for me, trying to consider where really you guys have really made the momentum shift in the last quarter to gain this much share in just a quarter's time spent really.", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, this is Liam. Some of these wins are certainly programs and applications with customers that have been in the works for years and months, right. So this is not a short-term reflection. Nokia is a great case. So we are moving forward with share gains. We're actually making great progress and continuing along our 3G path. Our multimode path as well as 2G. So that account is in great shape, we see continued upside there. And then in the broader markets, we're also seeing smartphones in general, tablets in general, higher end handsets in general present an expanding TAM, much faster than unit growth rate. So you get top 10 gains in these devices, and then there are many, many customers out there that we really are in the early innings, we've mentioned HTC, ZTE and Huawei are others, and there are some other smartphone players that quite frankly, we're in the early innings and have plenty of blue sky to grow share.", "David Aldrich", "And keep in mind just, to add a little color to Liam's comment, we are very diversified in this space. So the guidance may vary for company to company, the overall market is growing. And the market, we expect to grow in June. And we've got backlog coverage to that. So it is share gains and identified programs that are ramping, I can tell you the market is not bound for the June quarter. And so if the market is down for a particular company, it's a share issue, it's not the market. I think we benefit from diversification, while there are OEM share shifts that happen out there, they happen all the time. And that may be many accelerating, as there's so much dynamic, market is so dynamic. We attempt to stay so diversified that we can power through those and that's what's happening in June.", "Operator", "And that's all the questions that we do have at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Skyworks Solutions for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Aldrich", "Well, thank you everyone for listening.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti ", "Thank you, Robbie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Third Fiscal Quarter 2011 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial view and outlook. We'll then an open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David Aldrich", "Thank you, Steven, and welcome everyone. I'm very pleased to report another strong quarterly performance by Skyworks. We exceeded prior guidance across all key metrics. And based on recent design win activities, see a strong growth trajectory heading into the second half of 2011, driven by our compelling product portfolio, which continues to enable us to take share, our unique scale advantages, our customer and market diversity, as well as consistent operational execution, And specifically during the quarter, we delivered revenue of $356 million, which included $6.5 million of revenue from our recent acquisition of SiGe Semiconductor. Excluding the SiGe contribution, revenue would've been $350 million, and that's up 27% year-over-year organically.", "We expanded our profit margins with gross margins improving by 166 basis points and operating margins increasing by 430 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And as a result, we delivered strong operating leverage, as exhibited by our operating income being up 54% year-over-year to nearly $100 million.", "We're hearing $0.49 in diluted EPS, and we generated $86 million in cash flow from operations. We exited with more than $310 million in cash and this is after accounting for the SiGe acquisition and for stock repurchase activity during the quarter. And today, we're guiding the current quarter, September, to be a Skyworks record $400 million, with $0.53 of diluted earnings per share. And to put these results in perspective, during a challenging quarter for some of our market and OEM customers, our core business was up 6% sequentially last quarter, and our September quarter guidance has been accelerating sequential growth. And what's more, our unit shipments of 3G front-end modules were up over 100% versus last year. And at the same time, our high-performance analog product line grew at more than 3x the rate of the broader analog market. And our revenue has grown by 34% year-to-date.", "As our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook demonstrate, we're riding a very strong momentum and have a deep pipeline of growth opportunities spanning both our handset and our high-performance analog product lines. We see an expanding set of addressable market opportunities across the board. The rising RF dollar content and increasing complexity associated with the proliferation of smartphones and an array of other mobile Internet devices is fueling our TAM growth and providing a unique opportunity to extend our market leadership.", "Of note, Ericsson recently estimated that broadband mobile subscriptions were on track to surpass 1 billion mark in 2011. So that's up from just 0.5 billion only months ago. And more importantly, analysts are now forecasting that by 2015, mobile broadband subscriptions will reach nearly 4 billion, that's a fourfold increase over the next few years.", "And to that end, we see the advent of cloud computing applications as a major driver. Wireless connectivity is a key enabler of this enormous macro trend, as the cloud relies on anytime, anywhere access; whether it's for corporate data or personal music, photo, video. In fact, we're in the lab today with some of our major smart phone and tablet customers, developing solutions for just these applications.", "And by all accounts today, tablets are the next must-have device for consumers globally. Specifically, the Tablet segment is expected to grow at nearly 80% compounded annual rate for the next few years. And by 2014, we estimate that this category could represent nearly $0.5 billion in incremental TAM for Skyworks. And some market analysts suggest shipments could reach 70 million units this year alone, which is remarkable, as this product category didn't exist just a short time ago. ", "Now another big factor behind the rise in the mobile cloud is the pace of LTE rollout, and it's accelerating. In fact, earlier this year, the Global mobile Suppliers Association, or GSMA (sic) [GSA], noted that LTE is developing faster than other mobile technology ever. Currently, there are 20 LTE networks in commercial operation, with over 150 LTE deployments in progress in 60 countries around the world. The number of commercially operational LTE networks is expected to increase fourfold between now and just the end of 2012.", "So for Skyworks, these market dynamics translate into significant, long-term growth opportunities as the proliferation of LTE networks is creating an entirely new set of operating frequency bands that are currently being designed into tomorrow's mobile Internet access systems.", "On a standalone basis, LTE accounts for more than 15 new frequency bands worldwide, 15 new bands. Next generation smartphones, many of which will support global roaming, will include a combination of multiple LTE bands, along with full backward compatibility to 3G and 2G bands.", "As a result, the high-end LTE platforms we're currently architecting for 2012 are some of the highest dollar-content devices we've ever supported, with some containing as many as a dozen of addressable sockets for Skyworks. The addressable opportunity within these platforms ranges from products like RF front-end engines and multiple discrete 3G and 4G bands, to antenna switch modules and diversity switches, to wireless networking transmit and receive modules. ", "Now specifically of note here in the quarter, we powered multiple smart phone models that were recently launched by a major handset OEM using our converged, multimode, multiband products. And we began ramping our converged solution within several upcoming models of the Galaxy SII platform at Samsung, as well as other customers.", "In the quarter, we secured multiple PA duplexer designs in a leading forthcoming tablet, and we are now in production across a number of customers with these PAD products. We captured multiple LTE sockets in a major upcoming smart phone release by HTC. And we sampled our first BAW filter-based 3G product in support of Band II applications. Our PAD product line now spans all major operating frequency brands and it\u2019s gaining traction.", "Okay. Now switching gears to analog. The organization structure that we recently announced as our high-performance Analog business highlights our strong standing commitment to increase the diversification into new markets. With this organization now firmly in place, we're focused on increasing our market share in existing markets, and while at the same time identifying new addressable vertical market opportunities.", "In many cases, in fact, we see similarities in the dynamics between these new product areas and our Handset business. In both of these, we're addressing high growth markets, where RF complexity is increasing, and we're able to capture more dollar content. With the recent addition of the SiGe portfolio, we see our momentum increasing. These growth areas are key to our long-term strategy as they help increase our diversification, deepen our level of customer engagements and improve our corporate margin profile.", "During the quarter, we captured share in a number of diverse applications with new customers, specifically, we won multiple networking sockets within a forthcoming Internet TV platform. We enabled wireless connectivity at all 3 market-leading gaming console OEMs.", "We unveiled high-power RF filters for military and for home security markets. And we secured design wins for our high-power switches, modulators and digital attenuators with a leading supplier base stations for the rapidly growing TD-LTE China market. And finally, we ramped up Optocouplers solutions for medical, industrial and for satellite applications. ", "So in closing, our third fiscal quarter marked another strong performance for Skyworks, and we believe that our strategy of diversifying across baseband partners and customers and entering new vertical markets, while continuously improving operational execution, is clearly working.", "Now, before I turn it over to Don. I'd like to take a moment to add further color to our outlook. Over the past several months, we've received a great deal of investor interest in specific program launches and their potential impact on our ability to grow, and I'd like to address this. As the market share leader and as part of our normal course of business, we bid on literally dozens of sockets each and every quarter. And we don't win every socket. No one does. But on an aggregate, we win more than our fair share. And to be more specific, Skyworks has not lost any customers, nor have we been excluded from any major platforms.", "And if you look back over time, we've consistently proven our ability to grow, both in terms of revenue and profitability, despite the share shifts within our customer base and through some fairly choppy markets. We've just guided for a record September. And for Skyworks, we expect to continue to grow in December, both in an organic and a consolidated basis. This highlights the real power of our diversification strategy. And many of you who know us are familiar with our track record of focus on execution.", "So in summary, given the multiyear revenue drivers we've discussed, along with our design win traction, our expanding customer base and new market opportunities, Skyworks is well-positioned to continue to outpace this industry growth, not only in the second half of 2011, but in 2012 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over now to Don for his financial review.", "Donald Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us, everyone. I'll first provide a quick summary of our third fiscal quarter results, and then outline our business outlook for the fourth quarter.", "Revenue for the period was $356 million, which included a $6.5 million contribution from SiGe. Excluding SiGe, third quarter revenue would've been $349.5 million versus our guidance of $345 million and up 27% year-over-year organically.", "Gross profit was $160 million or 44.9% of revenue, representing a 166 basis point year-over-year expansion. Operating expenses were $62.5 million, R&D for the quarter was $38.8 million and SG&A was $23.6 million, yielding $97.5 million of operating income and a 27.4% operating margin.", "Our net interest and other expense for the quarter was $100,000 of expense, while cash taxes were $4.4 million, resulting in a 5% tax rate. As a result, our net income was $93 million or $0.49 of diluted earnings per share, $0.03 better than our guidance.", "Turning to our third quarter balance sheet and cash flow, we generated $86 million in cash flow from operations, attributable to our strong operating results and invested $20 million in capital expenditures during the quarter. As the sequential decline in CapEx suggests, our CapEx has now begun to moderate back towards steady state levels, as we have completed the majority of our capacity investments in both Mexicali and Newbury Park. Depreciation for the second quarter was $15 million, and we ended the quarter nearly debt free with a cash balance of $310 million, post the roughly $210 million for the acquisition of SiGe and $19 million as part of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Now to our business outlook. As Dave outlined, the stage is set for Skyworks to again outperform our addressable markets throughout the back half of 2011 and into 2012. We are well positioned to expand margins, deliver operating leverage and most importantly, to create shareholder value.", "For the current quarter, we are guiding revenue to be $400 million, with a $20 million to $25 million contribution from our SiGe acquisition and nothing yet assumed for our planned acquisition of Advanced Analogic. We'll provide commentary on the accretion for AATI during our fourth quarter conference call.", "At the aggregate $400 million level, we suggest modeling gross margins of $44.6 million to 45% and operating expenses of roughly $70 million. Below the line, we expect $200,000 of net interest and other expense, and we plan on our cash tax rate for Q4 to be 7%. As a result, we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $0.53 off of a base of 193 million shares. Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, you can go ahead and open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Maybe we can follow on that a little bit more, specifically regarding the transitions in market shares that you've talked about. Do you see any material fall-off in your core revenue, excluding SiGe, over the next 2 to 3 quarters? Or something that would make your performance relative to the market not comparable for a period of an adjustment? Or do you think you have enough diversity in your portfolio to maneuver through that? As you just said, business as normal, kind of things, ebb and flow.", "David Aldrich", "Yes, and I think as the current quarter and our outlook being up organically 7% sequentially, we also commented that we expected to grow in December. Hopefully, that answers part of your question. And as you mentioned, our performance and outlook isn't dependent on any one OEM or any one or 2 platforms. In the normal course of business, we bid on dozens of sockets, dozens and dozens of sockets. We don't win every one. But in aggregate, we win more than our share. And as I said, we haven't lost any single customers. We haven't been excluded from any major platforms. So I think our outlook speaks for itself. And certainly, we think it is the -- we are the beneficiary of a longstanding strategy to continue to diversify our business, both at a customer level and a market level.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And as a follow-up, want to get in, Don, into a little bit of the details around SiGe. Can you tell us, have you completed the OpEx realignment of that business? And at this point, how do we think about the headwind or contribution, whatever that may be, of SiGe, both to the gross margin line and operating margin line? And how should we think about that evolving through fiscal '12, at least directionally?", "Donald Palette", "Ittai, this is Don. We've -- we're, in fact, we had detailed plans in place even prior to the closing as exactly what direction we're going to go on as far as realigning the expense base. So we made a lot of progress. We continue to work through that. The guidance that you've received for Q4 has the Skyworks core operating expenses, pretty good estimate of where the SiGe expenses are going to be. There's also some increases in there. We're making some investments. And R&D headcount continue to execute against some market opportunities going forward. So based on what you're seeing for Q4 and, again, that's all prior to any AATI acquisition, that's a good proxy for what's going to go forward, normal types of increases. So that's the way I would think about it. As far as SiGe, for 2012, we don't guide beyond one quarter. We've given you the $20 million to $25 million, and we're currently working through on a revenue standpoint, an extensive review rationalization of the product portfolio as we align it with our Mobile Connectivity business. And we view the 2012 growth opportunities as attractive. As you know, from the information on the S-4 related to SiGe that their margins are slightly below our corporate average right now. We have specific plans in place. In very short order, we're going to drive those up to the Skyworks corporate average. We'd expect that to be sometime in the late 2012. So those are well on their way, and we feel real confident with that. And as a result, you can model that with what you know; and the acquisition is instantly accretive, we've already demonstrate.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG", "I was hoping you could talk a little bit about LTE, first, what demand are you actually seeing? When do you suppose it becomes really significant volumes? Is that in 2012, is it 2013? And also, could you talk about the complexity of front ends that are needed there? Do you need to -- do you have all the products you need or are you going to have to acquire more to sort of capture more of that complexity?", "David Aldrich", "Well, clearly, the complexity as we mentioned there, it's really mind-boggling to think that up to 50 new frequency bands. So the level of complexity, depending upon how broadly our customers want these devices to roam, is all over the map. But in all cases, increasing in complexity. So it is not 2015, it's 2012, it's now, in fact. We're starting to see some early rollouts, a lot of design activity with very specific program launches late this year, 2012, accelerating throughout 2012 and we think 2013. And I'll say there is nothing that we need. These technologies are quite consistent with what we've used in 3G; from a process, packaging, design, methodology, toolset. We have, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we have been working very, very closely with the world's largest and best, we think, both capitalized and technology wise, the best duplexer and filters suppliers. So we've rounded out, we added the Band II, which had been a gap for us. We've added that to a profile which is now complete. So that was the one area where we've made a great deal of investment in time and energy with our partners to have products that both meet the forward pricing curves of the market, but also overall performance. So I'd say that was the one area we needed to work on. We've done that. I would say, no, we don't need -- we certainly don't need to acquire any technology for LTE that we haven't already -- that we don't already have in place for 3G.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG", "And just one more question, what percent of your revenue was analog?", "Donald Palette", "Jonathan, the linear high performance analog was just north of 25%, and our handsets, smartphones were a little bit below 75% for the quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sujeeva De Silva with ThinkEquity.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC", "Following up on the filter announcement you have. Is there a reason you waited this long for to have a BAW filter for Band II? And is there an advantage for someone having it in-house versus you guys outsourcing that?", "David Aldrich", "No, there wasn't any strategy to wait until now. We needed to have a highly competitive product. So we were, as we would design the PA and the MCM technology around that band, we were working with our partners. And there's been a little challenge at that band to get to the size and height requirements. So certainly it wasn't strategic. We needed to get the product ready for the market and to meet all specifications, costs. But I think the real gate on Band II, unlike the other bands, is that size, specifically height, in some applications. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, we have partnered with filters suppliers, we make some ourselves. For the most part, we buy them when we include the MCM. And the reason for that is filter technology is apparently not integrated at the chip level. It's often not integrated at the module level, but sometimes it is for technical or cost reasons. And what we have found and what you'll see as the market progresses here is that by partnering with the best in the world, you're able to play, for example, SAW filter tends to be much cheaper. It also tends to be a little bigger. But it improves over time, moves up in frequency, tends to display its other more expensive technology. We like to be able to play that shift. And over time, the very well capitalized leaders in filters drive down their marginal cost curve and price it a point at which we don't think you can make the kind of margins our investors expect. So consistent with our strategy to buy -- to make what we need to make, to have a differential competitive advantage and buy the merchant market the best technology, this strategy is working for us. But we did have to fill that Band II gap.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC", "And then for Don, is it timely now to revisit the target model since you've hit $400 million of revenues? What you talked about before was acquistions or with that really require waiting until AATI to flesh that out?", "Donald Palette", "Yes, that's exactly right. If you look at the original, the model we have in place now that we'd come out and we communicated that at $375 million to $400 million, that we were going to be at 30% operating margin. The core business is still on track for that. Nothing's changed at all there. But now that we've layered in SiGe, as we said, right now, the product margins are a little bit below the corporate average. And as well, the OI percentage is slightly below the corporate average. We see a clear path for that changing by the end of 2012; and those being on par, if not better, in fact, depending on the growth rate. So what we're going to do is with that being incorporated into the business and AATI being layered in, we're going communicate to you once those are closed, and we've got full quarters of revenue and expenses for everybody to assimilate into their models then we'll communicate to you what the new operating model is for the company. But keep in mind, at one point what's really important is the core operating model is still intact, and there's no changes to that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank", "The first question is about just disconnect between the revenue growth you're seeing, versus some of your handset OEM and some of the baseband guys. So how do you explain that disconnect, is it basically the content or it is share gains? What is going on there?", "David Aldrich", "I presume you mean by that, our growth rate being higher?", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank", "Yes.", "David Aldrich", "It's a couple of things. One is, and absolutely, is an ongoing increase in content. I think what many find difficult to model, because it is complicated, is netting pricing against increased content, factoring in levels of integration where multiple PA frequencies can be integrated on a dyad [ph]. It is a complicated algorithm. But the directionally, it is increased content per phone, per device, per tablet is increasing, and looks to continue to do so here for the next few years. LTE being one of the drivers. So that's one. Another is we really do, unlike maybe some competitors or customers, we are quite diversified. So we really do -- we ship to everybody. We partner with all the baseband folks. We try to service them all equally well. And as a result, we don't get whip sore quite as much when you see big shifts in OEM, for example. We weathered high concentration years ago with customers that lost a lot of share, we were able to kind of power through that. So we're pretty proud of that, and it's a function of diversification. We also, as I said in our prepared comments, we've literally grown over High Performance Analog business. Although the group product lines, about 3x the growth rate of analog, which has been high single digits. And that's been a lot of hard work in identifying where we have a competitive advantage in the vertical and then doing customizes that import not only high margin, but they stick and certainly will have a very long product life cycle. But I have to say, it is that, it is new customers within our targeted Handset business, it's new vertical markets and it's raising content.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank", "And then the other question is about the second half of the year. Just wanted to drill down further and for the December quarter, should we assume that it could potentially be better than seasonality or in line with seasonality? Is that the right way to think about it?", "David Aldrich", "We don't guide to December. But we will grow, and it is our expectation, as is always the case with Skyworks, that we have opportunities to shake share that play out both in the short, medium and long term. So I'm sorry, we don't guide to December. But we'll grow the business in December, and we'll continue to work out taking share.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the Nathan Johnsen with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Nathan Johnsen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.", "Coming back to the discussion on the BAW filter and you guys competing for Band II sockets, are you guys in a position where you're competing for those now? Or are you sampling those customers and expect to compete for design, say, next year? Just some color around the timing of revenue, that would be fantastic. And then key customer Nokia, I just wondering if I could get a little insight as to the puts and takes there. You guys have clearly been benefiting from a platform transition there and you guys seem pretty well positioned to benefit from Windows Phone 7, but there's clealy been some headwinds just overall for that company. Just wondering if we should expect growth of that account in maybe fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011? And then one last question, just I guess, more near-term macro, given some of the risks or some of the concerns surrounding Europe and debt in the U.S., wondering if you're seeing any change in behavior on the part of OEMs could there potentially be a more conservative heading into the holiday phone season?", "David Aldrich", "Well, thank you, there's a lot there. Let me talk about Band II and then maybe I'll switch it over to Liam. He could talk about Nokia a bit. With respect to Band II, that was the one hole in our lineup for reasons I described, mostly size related. But the product now is fully characterized and validated and simulated. So as we sampled these now, we have high visibility into sockets now that will ramp relatively quickly. So it is in the future for Band II, but it was an area that we needed to address. And then the last part of your question, the overall market, no, we're not seeing any hedging in terms of -- most of our customers are in hubs. They need to pool what they're building, and they look to aggressively take share where there's opportunity to do so. So I don't see any OEM that's coming back and being conservative or for global macroeconomic reasons. They're all, just, I think slugging it out and trying to take as much share a whole lot to the base as they possibly can. Liam, maybe you can talk about Nokia?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. With respect to Nokia, as we stated before, we are today a major supplier to Nokia. We're shipping in all corners of their business; GSM, 3G, EDGE, even converged platforms. And our market share at Nokia has been growing steadily, but having said that, we're still now just about a third of their PA business. So there's room for us to grow. And if there are share shifts from Nokia to other OEMs, we're very well positioned to capitalize. And in fact, our prevailing amplifier share globally is about 40%. So if the share moves, we're likely to pick up elsewhere.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital", "Just a couple of questions. First, on 5G. I know quarters are not linear, they did 6.5 for a partial June, they did about $100 million last year. You guided to kind of mid or low $20 million, $25 million of that business. Just curious, that typically is the seasonally stronger quarter for them. Are you looking -- are you paring back product lines? Or is there something going on seasonally for them? That's my first question.", "Donald Palette", "Blayne, as I mentioned earlier when I talked about the SiGe outlook for 2012, we're absolutely going through the pruning exercise and doing the rationalization of the product portfolio, especially when you align it with our own Global Connectivity business. So that's part of it. And quite frankly, the other part if it is it's a new business. We're integrating it in our processes and trying to hold all that in and we're being a little bit conservative as well. It's a combination of those things.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital", "And when you look forward, is this the base or is there still some more of that work to? As far as the pruning of the product line?", "Donald Palette", "No, will be through that in pretty short order. That won't be a year-long process.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "Dave, just looking over to emerging countries, China and some of the faster growing reasons for handsets, some of the larger vendors in China, I'm sure those markets have talked about increased smart phone mix recently. Can you just talk about how you're positioned with some of the bigger vendors there?", "David Aldrich", "Yes, we've done, I think you're right about that. I think the one area that may in fact be underrepresented, we think, is the rate at which there'll be adoption of 3G products and networks in places like China or in developing markets. And in fact, we see it now, there's just so much demand the carriers are pushing for it. It's a little different rollout, a little bit of architecture in some cases. So we do think that's a high growth opportunity. And we're servicing in a couple of different ways: One is Mediatech has been a partner of us for a long time. We're the share leader there. We're working very hard with them. We have 3G products integrated with their solutions, and so we think they'll be a player there. They have competition, we\u2019re doing the same thing, with their indigenous local competitors. And we're pushing, obviously, very hard to continue to increase our share in content with our existing customer base that will be importing into those markets. So it really -- we do think it's a growth opportunity. We do think it may be underrepresented in many models, and we think we're very well positioned there.", "Craig Ellis - Caris & Company", "And then in your prepared comments, you talked about expanding your vertical market opportunities. And I wasn't clear if you were referring to tablets when you did mention of some of those opportunities or if there were other things that the company had started to target. So clarification there would be appreciated.", "Liam Griffin", "This is Liam. Yes, we're looking at a number of things. One of the areas now we're starting to work on are GPS. We're looking at GPS LNAs. We're very close to our first design wins in that category. It creates a nice adjacent sales to what we're doing with our Wireless business now. If you look at SiGe extension, not only does that give us a real strong leadership position in 802.11, they also have a Zigbee portfolio that allows us to get deeper into the home automation space. Those are a couple of good examples. I think there's a lot more we'll talk about as we get into 2012. But as Dave articulated, the real mission for HPA is to continue to diversify, look at markets that have high gross margin, high growth and an opportunity to dovetail with our sales and marketing teams.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Sanjay Devgan with Morgan Stanley.", "Sanjay Devgan - Morgan Stanley", "Just want to follow up on Blayne's question regarding the SiGe contribution. Was wondering if there's any more color you can provide just on as you're going through the pruning process, anything you can give us with respect to kind of long-term growth rates of SiGe? How do you view that? If we assume kind of a $20 million to $25 million run rate now, is that kind of -- what kind of growth do you expect there relative to the core business that you have today?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, this is Liam. We are very bullish on wireless connectivity as a market, as a segment. If you think about all these great things that are happening in cellular, you typically have an 802.11 connection whether it's a smartphone, a tablet, an Internet-enabled TV; in some cases even additional consumer products, e-books, et cetera. So we're very bullish on this space. What we like about SiGe is they have great technology. The people that we find in this company are outstanding hard workers. The technology is incredible, and it's also complementary to our existing portfolio today at Skyworks. So as we bring these companies together as Don articulated, we really are at the early stages. We're going to look at the best core IP, how we together can couple and deliver and develop products that no one else in the market can offer. So we expect it to be one of fastest growing portfolios going into 2012. We'll give you more color as we move forward.", "Sanjay Devgan - Morgan Stanley", "And then just secondly, quick question on internal utilization. Can you give us an update on how your internal SaaS were kind of utilized and how do you expect that to trend through the year?", "Donald Palette", "Sanjay, there's really no change from what we've been running at these levels for a considerable period of time. When you look -- and we talk about utilization from an equipment and facility standpoint. From an equipment standpoint, we're pretty much at a theoretical utilization, and we have been for some period of time. And from a building standpoint, probably 60%, 70%, which you couple that with the hybrid model where we do the in-source, outsource model, we can expand internal capacity very, very quickly by adding nominal CapEx investments. So that model's running really well for us. We had margin expansion again in Q3, and we think that's going to continue to 2012. So it's working very well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC", "Just wanted to come back to your comments about the December quarter. Do you think you can grow faster than the market in the December? Or do you just think you grow organically? And then I've got a follow-up.", "David Aldrich", "I think we can grow with the market and we have an opportunity to grow faster than the market.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC", "And then just looking, you'd mentioned you sort of teased us with some of the LTE designs you're working on right now. Can you just sort of talk about a typical LTE configuration that you're seeing requested by OEMs? Is this a couple 3 bands of LTE? And for those LTE bands, what do you think the dollar content? Is it $1, $1.50, $2 kind of per band per LTE?", "David Aldrich", "Yes, actually, the LTE, the value that we see in LTE phones now gets into the double digits in terms of values. So you're looking at literally $10 to $12. Now there's different levels of integration. Sometimes, you'll see a Band XIII, a Band II, a Band I, a Band IV. And you'll also invariably see a very strong GSM EDGE device and even WCDMA. So you have backward compatibility to WCDMA, and further down to GSM or EDGE you have discrete LTE bands. And then in addition to that, there's a great deal of switching complexity and filter complexity. So in addition to the GaAs PAs that you may see from us, we also are leveraging more of our pHEMT and our SOI switching capability. And again, if you think about in your mind's eye here how you have these different devices, they all need to communicate. Power and signals need to be communicated. Now that's often than through switch. So the complexity goes way, way up, the dollar value goes way, way up. And our addressable content just continues to accelerate there.", "Operator", "We'll go next Edward Snyder whether Charter Equity Research.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "On the BAW thing real quick here, as you are aware, I'm sure, Avago and TriQuint are the only other 2 sources for high-performance BAW. And the Japanese source you\u2019re using, obviously, has been working on for some time. They don't publish the specs, so I'm just curious, in your opinion, as it relates to developments brought in with parity in terms of performance both in filter performance itself and in size, and then given how tough this area is, is pricing on it going to be a problem for stack margins? Or do you think you can cut a deal or your relationship with them will allow you to get to that attractive enough cost that you compete with the other 2 who are building it internally? And then on the fourth quarter comments about revenue growth, is any part of that include AATI quarterly revenue? Obviously, within the $20 million to $30 million range. Are you counting on any of that to achieve your comments about the top line growth in the fourth quarter?", "David Aldrich", "No, we're not. We're assuming -- we're not putting any AATI in our guidance. So you should assume when you model that there's 0 AATI. As far as filters, the size parity is equal. So that's not an issue. And when we talk about performance, the performance of the filters themselves are best in class. And there's nobody better in the world than companies like [indiscernible], for example, and Panasonic and others. So the performance of filter is good. As you probably know, the trick is being able to spend enough time with those filters to tune them, to match them to the amplifier and to get the overall transmit path to have the lowest current consumption, the best harmonics and so on. So you need to work with them a little bit. And then that feedback [indiscernible], \"How do you create both the best filter, the MCM, the best matching, the best PA so that the whole transmit path gives you the lowest current consumption and the best overall RF performance. And that's taken some time, but it is absolutely at parity. And in fact, on the cost side, I would put forth that over time, it will be a cost advantage not to try to make these filters. Because when you think about it, there are going to be a lot of competing filters -- because there are a lot of multiple competing filter technologies that are going to try to move up the frequency band, frequency range. For example, surface acoustic filters are inherently cheaper than the bulk acoustic that has a lot of process steps, and the rest here are really big and well capitalized. It's hard to have every band in a complete rollout of multi-band designs, pads and do that all internally. So you tend to have to be kind of niched and focused on certain bands. We don't have that -- we don't have the problem. We can play BAW versus SAW. And I'll tell you from experience of 20 years in this business, what happens is as these bands become more common in the market and the band combinations become more common in the market, which will happen, even in this sort of crazy LTE world today, these filter guys will solve it and then boy, as soon as they do, they drive down their marginal cost curve and they'll price it exactly where they need to and then it'll be really hard for small-ish filter companies to make any money. So we think the gross margin is better to be a procurer of merchant filters than it would be to do it internally. And over time, that disadvantage of being an internal supplier will become more acute, because nobody will beat these guys on price, nobody.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "That speaks to exactly my next question, which is that sounds like the combination of the GaAs, in terms of how you're matching to the BAW filters because, really, in a pad, it's the entire system, it isn't just the filter, it's a standalone basis itself. So you've been working with them and it's the combination of the filter and your GaAs that you\u2019re suggesting is going to be competitive with some of these internal guys. And Skyworks had an effort in BAW back in '04, right? I'm sure that you're well aware of expenses of trying to do a BAW. Is that what you're speaking to in terms of a lot of companies have tried it. It turns out to be hugely expensive and complicated. So that's the investment in [indiscernible] doing that?", "David Aldrich", "The process is just so complex. So what we found was that unless you could drive a megafactory with a great deal of utilization, you had a real total cost disadvantage. And frankly, even though our BAW filters were pretty good. When we then said, \"What does it take to address the entire market?\" it was mind-boggling. And so you've got folks who have invested billions in this business, and they've got highly utilized, state-of-the-art factories, and we just -- there was no way we could compete. It wasn't going to provide a differential advantage to our customers. It's a classic example of just don't try to beat them, go out and join them. Buy it, partner with them. And one thing that's interesting because it's not lost on these folks that having access into smartphones and tablets is absolutely key to their business model. And our competitors have that technology internally. So we have become the partner of choice. We're the bigger -- we sell more PAs than anybody in the world, and we have a path to all the customers that they covet. So let me tell you, if there's a motivation on anybody's part to partner, it's these very same filter companies.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Dale Pfau with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.", "Could you talk just a little bit about the architecture you're seeing going forward, that you're bidding on now for production in '12 and '13? Is there any particular direction people are leaning on the front-end architectures, Dave?", "David Aldrich", "Well, Dale, one of the things that we're seeing, we talked a lot about is the need for performance is really stepping up; the need for multiple bands, roaming, data handling. Invariably now, these devices, smartphones and tablets are going to manage high-speed data, high-speed video, cloud computing. So we are seeing that. The value of the product that we deliver's going up. The complexity is going up, and competitive landscape needs to meet that challenge. So we do see content increasing. We see the companies that have the R&D capabilities and the IP to deliver not just one band or 2 band, but really, the full-scope LTE, WCDMA, the backward compatibility, the GSM and also the switching and filtering. I think the companies that have that combination, they're very few. Those are the companies that are going to win.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.", "But you aren't seeing a trend towards fully converged hybrids discrete pads?", "David Aldrich", "No. In fact, we're seeing that's it's kind of interesting, particularly at the tablet side and on the high-end smartphones, it's all about performance. And as LTE's coming online believe it or not, those platforms tending to go a little more discrete. Some of them place towards converge early and the performance is okay. So it's sort of all over the map. We're seeing very discrete designs. We're seeing hybrid somewhere in between pads, discrete, coupled with a multiband EDGE device for example, and then we're seeing fully converged. It's hard to say, but I would say today, the vast majority, going forward, in our estimate would be some form of a hybrid design, with the minority being fully converged or fully discrete.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum Capital.", "Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC", "Dave, if you won't mind talking a little bit more in detail in China in terms of ASP and content growth either going from 2G to 2.5G to 3G. Love to hear your views there. I think you've said in the past, ultimately, you think you can get to $3 per phone on average on a full-fledged 3G. Also, Dave, if you won't mind talking about your view on reference design tractions for you guys heading into 2012? And then before I forget, Don, 2 questions, is it the same 3 10% customers, and also any changes what's your view on tax rate for fiscal 2012?", "David Aldrich", "Well, I think was your question on dollar content, was it specifically China?", "Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC", "Yes, China.", "David Aldrich", "That's a great question because it's not obvious that there will be as many platforms that really want to roam globally that will be produced for the China market. And in fact, there are some customers that are really pushing for a GPRS, 3G design, right? So that they can download in 3G speeds and upload at GPRS so you can bypass EDGE, that makes it little bit less expensive for mass consumption. And it's all about getting well below a $100 smartphone. I think that's going to happen. There'll be different configurations. It will increase the dollar because the dollar content in a 2G phone shipping in the low-end market, we typically address the very low end of that, the CMOS. And all CMOS design is pretty low today. So it is a 2x, if not a 3x or 4x content, even for those that won't have to roam very, very broadly.", "Liam Griffin", "Yes. And let me add, if you look at China, some of our fastest growing accounts in that, we've had a great position with Mediatech. We've talked a lot about that, largely in GSM. They are moving into 3G. But if you look at the real strength in our 3G business, it's Huawei and ZTE. And these companies are making not only phones, but also data cards and wireless modules. So we're seeing some upside. And if you indulge me a little bit, we'll jump into Taiwan and look at HTC. HTC is one of our fastest growing customers now, very powerful suite of smartphones where we're selling complete 3G solutions, EDGE devices, WCDMA band, a great deal of switching. So on the whole, greater China region, we are seeing that dollar content move up from what was $0.80 market per phone to something closer to the $2.50 to $3.50.", "Donald Palette", "Anthony, this is Don. On the tax rate, it's probably worth pointing out, we were at the lower tax rate this quarter. And basically, what we have to do on the tax accounting is you do an annual projection every quarter. And we started out the year at 8.5%, we dropped it to 7%. It now looks like we're going to be roughly a little bit below 7%. So you make that quarter to date, year to date adjustment, that's where you head to the 4.5%, and then we guided to the 7%. So the rate's going to end up roughly around 7% for the year. We're not going to give any more color. We've said to use around 11% in 2012. We really have to assimilate the acquisition to see what -- there's some NOLs and see what that means. We'll give you more color on that as we do that. But right now, the 11% is fine.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Just a quick one, real quick. If I could, on the timing. I don't know if you answered this question, Dave, but on the timing of the BAW filter, when do you think we can start to see that come to market for you guys?", "David Aldrich", "You're talking exclusively about Band II because we're in the market with others.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "Sorry, Band II, yes.", "David Aldrich", "We're sampling that now so you should see that in 2012.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "And then in terms of how you think with the conversion PA solution, now that you're doing a conversion PA for the Galaxy 2 [Galaxy SII], and that seems to be a high end smartphone. And I know you just spoke about maybe the performance still matters, but do you think that maybe we might start to see some of even the higher end guys start to use a converged platform to try and drive down costs?", "David Aldrich", "I think you'll see some. I think you'll see some do that. I know you will. You'll see some customers are converting as we speak to converge. Some customers are going from converged away to more hybrid, believe it or not, because they have more interest in performance than a couple of back- and front-end content. And then we have everything in between; truly, everything between. The tablet, the high end products do tend to be, on average, more concerned with performance than they are with overall cost, with some exceptions and you just named one. So I think you'll see everything. I think if you look at 2013 as an example, I think the majority will be some kind of a hybrid. That's easy to say. That just simply means that there'll be some integrated bands with amplification. There'll be some bolt-on discrete. There'll be some filter amplifier technology. I think that'll be an architecture that will prevail, and converge will absolutely have its place and have a growing segment of the market. And I don't think there's very many phones that are truly, completely discrete; although there are few.", "Aalok Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Dave, one of the arguments that I get is the bears make is, at some point, the dollar content story, the dollar increase content story starts to wear out. How do you guys think about that in terms of -- as these handset guys start to get a little bit more competitive on price, how do you guys think about your position in that? I mean, at some point, though, your dollar content can't increase anymore. How do you think about that?", "David Aldrich", "Well, there are 2 responses to the bears in that case, one is LTE. It's just not possible to integrate these bands and configurations and our customers in the market demands with LTE without having increased content. It's just not possible today. And so for a few years, you're going to see LTE continuing to become a play there. The other piece is that you will see increasingly a very high growth rate in smartphones and a decline in true 2G phones. And even the most low-end 3G integrated converged product you can think of, that doesn't need to roam, is incrementally 2x or 3x what a 2G call is today. So there really isn't, if you do the math, there isn't any scenario that doesn't show increase in content that I can dream of.", "Liam Griffin", "Right, and that's a very strict view of handsets. If you step back and look at what else is happening, clearly, tablets are taking off and cannibalizing notebooks. We really don't have any 3Gs or any cellular share. You see that taking off, and then other devices that we see enabled with wireless technology. The Wi-Fi capability now, we're seeing 2.4 gig and 5 gig devices, not integrated into the transceiver, which is projected but not discretely laid out in these devices. So as Dave said -- the smartphone tradeoff from $0.80, dollar level parts, CDMA is going to, GSM is going down. And we see the upside now with new devices like tablets.", "Operator", "And with that, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the program back over to Mr. Aldrich for any additional or closing comments.", "David Aldrich", "Okay. Well, thank you so much for participating on today's call, and we look forward to seeing you all at upcoming investor conferences.", "Operator", "That concludes today's call.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti ", "Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' fourth fiscal quarter 2011 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP. With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report a strong finish to our 2011 fiscal year with another consistent quarter of execution by the Skyworks team. We exceeded our prior guidance and we secured a steady flow of new design wins, building upon an already solid foundation for 2012. With this pipeline in place, Skyworks is well positioned to further expand its market leadership in 2012 and beyond. ", "Specifically during the quarter, we delivered record revenue of $402 million, which was up more than 28% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. We expanded our profitability and delivered strong operating leverage, producing fourth quarter operating income of $109 million, and that's up 34% year-over-year, and we earned at the same time $0.54 in diluted earnings per share. We generated $123 million in cash flow from operations. ", "Our fourth quarter results closed out a strong fiscal '11 -- 2011 for Skyworks. And to put our results in perspective, on an annualized basis, we posted 32% of revenue growth. We expanded our market share, and we are now the established, clearly established leader in mobile connectivity. In fact, we grew our 3G front-end module shipments by more than 150% over the course of the year, and we increased our operating income by 56% and we improved our returns by over 400 basis points. We generated $366 million in cash flow from operations and we exited the year with $411 million in cash on the balance sheet. And we created meaningful economic value with the return on invested capital of just over 23%. And this incidentally is more than double our weighted average cost of capital. ", "So in retrospect, fiscal 2011 marked a year of significant progress for us, and our fundamentals remain solid and sound and our design win momentum continues to build. However, as a diversified company, we are not completely immune to the global economic macroeconomic forces. In the near term, we do see pockets of industry softness and we see more cautious ordering patterns impacting our business. Our Q1 outlook reflects the effects of this environment, offset by key program ramps at specific customers. ", "To be more specific, we have recently seen more tentative order activity within certain segments of the Android smartphone market, and we've recently seen some signs of sluggishness in smart energy in North America wireless infrastructure. We believe these factors are a function of the current global macroeconomic environment and represent a temporary market pause within a larger long-term growth trend. Given this, we believe that guiding slightly down on a sequential basis is warranted. ", "Beyond the current period, our strategic growth engine remains firmly in place. Global adoption of smartphones continues to be robust and is being quickly followed by a growing tablet adoption cycle. Moreover, wireless functionality is becoming embedded into a seemingly unending array of new applications. This proliferation of embedded wireless will drive a tremendous increase in the number of connected devices over the next few years. In fact, GSMA recently released research which suggests that the number of mobile connected devices is expected to reach 12 billion by the year 2020. That's twice the number in service today. ", "Equally as important across all categories of mobile Internet devices, RF complexity and dollar content continues to rise. This is driven by an increasing number of radio frequency bands, a broad array of protocols and multiple simultaneous modes of operations. All of these growth engines are long term in nature, and they're still in the early stage of playing out, providing time expansion opportunities across our markets in the coming years. ", "And digging a bit deeper into our market drivers, smartphones are entering the stage of mass market adoption globally and becoming even more integral to consumers' daily lives, folding in the functionality of traditional mobile phones, always-on internet connectivity, social networking, portable gaming, digital cameras, HD camcorders and even mobile payment systems, and the list goes on and on. Our customers, in fact, are segmenting features, price points and data plan options to facilitate a migration from high-end business units to more mainstream consumers and ultimately to the emerging markets. So leveraging our leading edge analog solutions, we are actively engaged across this entire ecosystem, uniquely supporting all mobile operating systems and all baseband suppliers. ", "Within the high-end performance segments specifically, we see a strong flow of LTE-based devices for 2012, many of which is supporting -- or support global roaming and include a combination of multiple LTE bands, along with full backward compatibility to 3G and 2G. In fact, the high-end LTE platforms we are currently architecting for 2012 are some of the highest dollar content devices we've ever supported, with some containing as many as a dozen addressable Skyworks sockets. These high-end devices demand very high RF performance and they tend to rely on highly complex front-end architectures, with very stringent performance-driven specifications. And this plays directly to Skyworks' competitive advantages as evidenced by our early move of position in LTE. ", "Now at the other end of the spectrum, the sub $150 smartphones are enabling a major upgrade cycle, with prepaid in emerging markets where there is a large embedded base of 2G phones. Now if you look back just a few years ago, we were talking about how the first phone call made by many subscribers in developing countries would be on a mobile phone. And as we see today, this projection has turned out to be overwhelmingly accurate. But similarly, we believe that these same subscribers will access the Internet for the very first time from a low cost smartphone. We see this segment driving a significant expansion in our TAM as 2G feature phones, which today contend less than $1 of content, of RF content as they migrate to entry-level smartphones, which have more than 3x an increase in the addressable content. And in fact, Skyworks benefits from its long history as a supplier in this segment, leveraging deep integration capabilities, our scale and the industry's lowest cost structure, to extend our existing leadership position in this market. ", "Tablets also represent another significant incremental opportunity for Skyworks. By some analysts' forecast, the tablet market could grow to over 200 million units by the year 2014, which would represent almost $500 million in addressable content. And Skyworks is playing a key role in the evolution of the tablet market. Within this segment, our current engagements and our product portfolios spanning cellular, 3G, 4G and wireless network connectivity provide us with the broadest footprint in the industry. In fact, Skyworks' products are currently designed into virtually all of the world's leading tablets on the market today. ", "Okay, now turning over to the fourth quarter highlights. Specifically, we ramped multimode, multiband, front-end solution for our Samsung's Galaxy SII smartphone and tablet platform. We commenced shipments for key models of Samsung's Android-based Nexus S smartphone, which include a Skyworks sweep of the entire front end. We've supported ZTE's ramp of its next generation tablets and notebooks with EDGE, WCDMA and LTE front-end solutions. And we've captured a key front-end content in Nokia's forthcoming Windows-based smartphone platform. And finally, we're very excited to be ramping our LTE power amplifiers and our high-performance switches in support of Motorola's DROID RAZR 4G smartphone. ", "And at the same time, our high performance analog product lines or HPA are gaining traction across an even wider array of end market. The various applications served by these product lines is expanding, ranging everything from military radar to wireless infrastructure to smart appliances, electronic toll tags and hearing aids. I think its one recent examples, Skyworks offers a complete portfolio of solutions for the connected home market, enabling delivery of HD video, high-speed data and multimedia distribution via fiber, hybrid fiber coax or direct broadcast satellite networks. This innovative portfolio is highly complementary, obviously, to our wireless business, and it includes products like modulators and demodulators, mixers, high-isolation switches, digital and voltage variable attenuators, detectors, hybrid couplers and more. In leveraging this broad portfolio, we were recently awarded multiple sockets within a number of Cisco's home multimedia gateway products. These new design wins leverage a suite of Skyworks products, including our digital attenuators, switch blocks and amplifier products. ", "And just to go on, during the quarter, we also captured wins across a number of other diverse applications. And specifically, we commenced volume production of advanced antenna switch modules or ASMs supporting Huawei suite of 3G data cards. We also have ramped shipments of 802.11a, b, g and front-end modules with multiple LED high definition television manufacturers. And we secured production orders for our MRI signal switch matrix with Siemens Healthcare. This application uses 800 of Skyworks' multithrow switches in a single MRI scanner. And we supported Tier 1 home security solutions with multiple ODMs using our fully integrated Zigbee front-end solutions. And we believe these applications clearly demonstrate our success in diversifying our business into highly profitable, new adjacent market segments for us. ", "So with the market working its way through the current business cycle, it's worthwhile taking a step back to refocus on a long-term opportunity. In short, the Internet -- the mobile Internet is supplanting the wired Internet on a global basis and the proliferation of wireless networking connectivity technologies like 802.11, like Bluetooth, Zigbee and GPS, is expanding across a broadening array of non-handset applications, including Blu-ray players, gaming consoles, LED TVs, high-power access points, enterprise routers and network PCs. And cloud computing is driving ever increasing demands for consumers to be connected all the time, at all times. Performance requirements and technical complexity are rising, and our RF content -- and the RF content continues to increase. All of these positive market dynamics are still in the early earnings. And as the market leader in wireless connectivity, the opportunity for Skyworks has never looked better. ", "And with that, I'll now turn it over to Don for his review.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us, everyone. We appreciate it. I'll first provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. ", "Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $402.3 million, up 28.4% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Excluding our SiGe acquisition, we grew 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Gross profit was $179.7 million or 44.7% of revenue, representing a 90-basis-point year-over-year expansion. ", "Operating expenses were $70.3 million, including R&D expense of $42.4 million and SG&A expense of $27.9 million, yielding $109.4 million of operating income and a 27.2% operating margin. ", "Our net interest expense and other income for the quarter was $555,000 of income, while cash taxes were $6.1 million, translating into a 5.6% tax rate. ", "Net income was $103.8 million or $0.54 of diluted earnings per share, a penny better than our guidance. ", "Turning to our fourth quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $122.8 million in cash flow from operations, our best cash generation quarter in the history of the company. We invested $15.3 million in capital expenditures. Our CapEx is now approximately back at steady state levels and is roughly in line with depreciation, which was $16.7 million. As a result, our free cash flow during Q4 was $108 million. We ended the quarter nearly debt free, with $411 million in cash after accounting for a repurchase of 500,000 shares of stock during the quarter. ", "It is worth pointing out that the business model we have in place is generating significant cash flow for the company and at the same time creating economic value. As a measure of this, our return on invested capital for 2011, including excess cash, was 23%, roughly twice our weighted average cost of capital. And in fact, for fiscal 2011, our ROIC improved by approximately 600 basis points year-over-year. ", "For sometime now, we have maintained a strategic objective of delivering financial returns comparable with those of the best diversified analog players, along with top line growth of the mobile Internet. Our financial results highlight that we have taken major strides towards this goal. These healthy financial terms are the direct result of our focused business strategy, which combined scale advantages and a flexible manufacturing model to generate significant financial leverage in our business model. We expect to continue to post strong shareholder returns to our fiscal year 2012 and beyond. ", "Now for our first quarter 2012 business outlook. We are guiding revenue to be up 16% year-over-year to $390 million. At this level, we suggest modeling gross margin in the 44% to 44.5% range, with operating expenses of roughly $69 million. Below the line, we expect $200,000 of net interest and other expense. We expect our cash tax rate for Q1 and for fiscal year 2012 to be in the range of 8.5%. As a result, we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $0.50 on a base of 191 million shares. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks and so operator, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first in queue today, we will hear from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Dave, can you talk a little bit more about the weakness that you've seen? I'm trying to understand in your interpretation how much of it is soft demand. Or is it just that the vendors you're shipping into are having competitive challenges? And as a second layer to that question, do you feel like you're holding your share with those vendors? Or do you think there's a market share, your own market share problem evolving as well in some of those vendors?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think the first part of your question, Ittai, is we've seen typically a layer in the quarter. We began to see some evidence to some of Android customers not quite as aggressive going into the December quarter. We've also seen some pretty significant softness in infrastructure.  I think that's been pretty well publicized.  As you know, our HPA business is very broad. So we've seen some softness in energy management. We've seen some softness in infrastructure. Offsetting that is we are ramping. We're ramping at Samsung. We're ramping it, as we discussed in our prepared comments. We're ramping at HTC and ZTE. We're ramping in Huawei. So if I look at it, we see those as the primary drivers behind our Q1 guidance, and we think it's prudent to be conservative. There's an awful lot of sort of macroeconomic chop out there, and we see that a little bit in the channel. And I would answer no, that we don't believe we're losing market share. Our position with those customers are strong and there are a lot of exciting platforms that are being led during this period of time and into 2012, and we're quite well positioned.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, very good. And Don, can you talk about your linear business. I mean, was it up in September? And do you expect it to be more -- I mean, you guided the company to be down 3% on a sequential basis, if I'm not mistaken. But would you expect that business to be down more than 3%? Can you give us sort of like more or less where the different pieces are moving between the cellular business and your linear business?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, we ended up, Ittai, for the quarter at approximately 30% linear, or HPA as we referred to it, and 70% handset smartphones. And there isn't anything in our current projections that would indicate that, that percentage is going to change significantly in the short term.", "Operator", "Moving along, we'll go to Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to clarify. You said there was some weakness in Android, but you said Samsung is up. So I'm assuming that, that means the Android softness you're seeing is excluding that customer? And I was wondering if you could also perhaps also comment -- I know it's a delicate topic -- but the iOS operating system, whether you'd expect that out flat or down?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think it's not Samsung, so you're right about that. And we really can't comment on the iOS operating system. I think those numbers are fairly well publicized, and they've given their own guidance.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then the net of it all, your guidance is actually quite a bit better than most peers are demonstrating right now. I'm wondering what your backlog coverage for that is? And then also perhaps if you could look out in Q1 based on some of the new pipeline products, particularly in the LTE area. Would you expect to continue to be able to outperform either in the industry or seasonality, if you could comment on that?", "Donald W. Palette", "Alex, this is Don. As far as backlog coverage, as you know we always talk about, we take a very typical -- a very conservative approach to the forecasting. And as we're entering into the quarter in the current fall, we currently have 100% coverage and that's both a combination of booked from purchase orders from customers and then the hub pulls. That combination is at 100%.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think, Alex, the second part of your question. As we look ahead in the March quarter and so on, December. Clearly, there is some uncertainty in the macro environment. We've seen that in the order pattern in some of our customers. Smartphones, you're right, is an area of relative strength. We've got some pockets of varied -- a lot of strength in our HPA business. But obviously, we're quite diversified. So we're not immune from that overall macro market chop. So bottom line, I said you'd expect to see a bit of normal seasonality in the March quarter. And as for the reasons we described in our prepared comments, we do expect to take share in 2012.", "Operator", "Moving forward, we will go to Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I just wanted to get a better understanding between the 2 moving parts, that is your linear business and the handset business. Would it be right to say that your linear business outgrew your handset business during this quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, that's correct.", "Donald W. Palette", "That's correct.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And regarding your guidance, if you look at the guidance of many of them -- a lot of companies and also some of your competitors, their linear business guidance is down significantly, almost double digit going forward. Any idea of what your linear business is going to do in the December quarter?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. As Don mentioned, I mean, we should probably be on par with the overall company guidance. And as you know, there has been some weakness in the channel in general. And in many cases, while performing in the end markets, we're still seeing some growth in market. So specifically, our GPS portfolio, which is a new launch for us. Our wireless LAN business is very strong right now. And with SiGe under our wing, we have a design pipeline that's really going to carry us forward in 2012. And there are a number of new products in ASM, antenna switch modules, that are giving us some upside. So we are -- as much as this quarter had some headwinds and we're going to be close to our corporate average, we are outperforming much of our peer group.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think the way to look at it in September and December, just to add on Liam's comments, we do see on infrastructure, we see smart energy down, mobile connectivity up. So I guess, I'll characterize it a little bit more broadly. I think that the traditional component business and what you'd think of our HPA business is down and seeing some of the same dynamics. But we have a host of new product platforms that we've been driving into the market the last 6 months. And those are up. They're  coming from their infancy, but we have broadened our footprint here quite a bit. We mentioned some of those in the prepared comments. So that's what we're seeing, relative growth and it's offsetting some of the more sort of broad-based weakness.", "Operator", "Moving along, we'll go to Craig Ellis of Caris & Company.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I have just one further clarification on the Android issue. Can you clarify if what you're seeing is overall in handsets or if there is any divergence in trends between smartphones and future phones? And is tablets playing a part in the order softening that you're seeing there?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. Craig, it's primarily handsets. I would say it's more mid-tier feature phone then smartphone. Tablets in general, we're very bullish on tablets.  I think we're going to have a -- we have a very good position this year. We're going to continue to gain next year regardless of operating system. We think that's a great market for Skyworks. So that's the way we would characterize that.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Thanks, Liam. And Don, can you just let us know where you were from a utilization standpoint in the third quarter and what should we expect for 4Q?", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure, Craig. Again, we always like to separate these really 2 types of utilization that are important to us. And one is sort of your line utilization, and we expect that to be pretty much at capacity. It wasn't in our September quarter, and it will be through December. We still have some square footage available. And most of our facilities allows us with some small CapEx investments to move forward. The key to this is the hybrid model. And as we see any ramps or any softening in the market, what we do is we either upload more business outside to our supply base for both wafers and assembly and test that will bring that back in. So that's how we flex and how we remain competitive. And we're able to drive best-in-class margins regardless of the cycle.", "Operator", "Next in queue, we'll hear from Cody Acree with Williams Financial.", "Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Maybe a couple of things. I just spent some time on the comparable markets on the converged opportunity, the multimode opportunity. It sounds like that's beginning to be a bit more of a driver and definitely a different tune, I think, from you guys in the industry and that we heard a year ago. Can you just talk about what customers are doing there and what you're seeing that as maybe a changing opportunity versus maybe a few quarters back?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I think that the MMMB or the multimode integrated PA opportunity continues to be strong. I think the market has in many ways, bifurcated from the MMMB for sort of, maybe the mid to low tier and then more performance-driven products that are increasingly hybrid with a lot of discrete content. We're seeing increasing push for more performance and more content overall, driven by the proliferation of bands. And there's a lot more content that we're addressing, for example, we are now ramping ASMs. We expect to be a major player in antenna switch modules. GPS LNA products, WiFi mobile connectivity products, in addition to the content that you would normally think about, from Skyworks coming in and sort of the PA transmit front end. I would say, it is very much what we have been talking about in the past. We see customers that are remaining with hybrid and discrete designs. And in fact, that segment is growing and it's performance-driven and it's tablets and it's high-end smartphones. We also see the push for the $100 and sub-$150 smartphone driving more creative levels of integration in order to just drive more cost out. Some of them are pretty creative. And that will be displacing more of a 2G market sets. So I don't think there's been any difference in our outlook on the market, other than performance, current consumption size. Everybody is looking at that concern with it, looking for the ultimate solution for that. But they're  unwilling to give up performance for size.", "Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "And then secondly, there's been some comments from some of your competition about capacity in the industry that there's some excess capacity overall, and that's likely to lead to some increased aggressive pricing competition. I guess, what's your view on that?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, the pricing we're seeing right now, continues to be sort of in the high single-digits. Last year, I think, Don, it was a little bit less than 8%.", "Donald W. Palette", "That's right.", "David J. Aldrich", "Part-to-part year-over-year. We track that at nauseam by the way, and we're running that now. It tends to run in the 8% maybe 9% sometimes. It doesn't hit 10% in aggregate, that\u2019s being offset obviously, by much more content per platform or more dollars of revenue and more dollars of margin it continues to march up with. So I think that continues to be the trend.", "Liam K. Griffin", "And Cody, just to -- as that relates to where we are in profitability, the ASP erosion is not new for us. We're very accustomed to dealing with that. And our year-over-year cost reduction has typically offset the erosion and all you have to do is look at the margin expansion history we've had to show that. So this is something that we pretty effectively deal with as we grow the business model and the returns to the business.", "Operator", "Moving forward, we will go to Sujeeva De Silva with ThinkEquity.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "First question on the mix. It seems like linear was up a little bit this quarter. How do you think that mix will play out as we go through fiscal '12, linear versus handset?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I think that the -- as Don suggested, we're seeing some softness and some relative strength in both our smartphone and mobile Internet space, as well as HPA. And so we're looking at not seeing a shift or any meaningful shift in the December quarter versus what we saw, that 70/30 split. As we look out throughout the year, I mean, it varies a little bit quarter-by-quarter. Typically, in the second quarter, you see a little bit more seasonality on the mobile space than you do in a more diversified HPA. So that can move the dial a little bit. But as we go out throughout the year, we expect to see a resurgence in some of the Android customers we talked about and our wireless business moving throughout the year. There's an awful lot of opportunity out there. The dollar content is high. The margin is good. So we think we're really going to see strength throughout the year, building throughout the year, based on these designs and these new platforms. And we've got pretty high aspirations for HPA. I guess it's a long-winded way to say I wouldn't model the split to be much different.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Now that's very helpful. And your bullish on Android phones, is some of that coming from 3G entry phone side. Can you talk about when should there be unit TAM there as your share opportunity is, as we go forward?", "David J. Aldrich", "The unit TAM is -- there's 2 ways to look at it. An entry-level smartphone has less unit TAM than high-end smartphones, so the number is perhaps 2 or 3 to 1 in a high-end smartphone. Let's call it an even $9 or $10 in a very high-end device, high-end product when you sweep in the mobile connectivity, as well as the bands of LTE and 3G so it's $10 or so. If you look at a low-end smartphone, that number is maybe $3. If you look at the antenna or the switch -- the antenna switch module, the power amplifier, the filters. There are fewer bands and those bands tend to be more integrated and the multimode device are more integrated in that case. But I guess I look at that $3, not as, gee, it's too bad it's not $10. I look at it, boy, I'm glad it's not $1, which is what it's displacing, it's displacing $1 GPRS devices on the ultra low-end feature phone side.", "Operator", "Next question in queue will from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Dave, can you help us understand your sales mix, in terms of smartphones versus feature phones versus traditional 2G phones and how it has sort of trended over the last few quarters?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, the breakout by interface is that our 2G was roughly 30% this quarter and EDGE, WCDMA roughly 70%. Last quarter, that was 31%, 69%. So it's relatively flat to last quarter.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And smartphones versus traditional?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, we don't normally split that. I think that you're seeing a lot more content per unit in smartphones. But obviously, the unit count is a little bit slower there, so it may be Smartphone's 50-50 versus feature phone.", "Operator", "Next question in queue will be from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I know you don't want to guide for March, but I was wondering if you could talk about some of the headwinds that you saw or seeing in Q4, if they continued into the March quarter, outside of just normal seasonality?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, it's difficult to say. And you're right, we don't guide the March quarter. It's hard to handicap what we're seeing in a macro environment. Of course, that's sort of -- that concern about the macro environment oftentimes says, it's a psychological effect that impacts ordering patterns and so we saw a little bit of that in December, just leaning out the channel a bit. I don't see anything that leads me to believe it's not going to be sort of a net 10% to 15% marked seasonality. I think the strength being in smartphones, which continue we believe to chug along and add growth for us, we see the platforms that we discussed and some of the newer stuff that's offsetting some of the general market softness. But clearly, there's some uncertainty in that environment that we need to keep an eye on. So we're thinking about normal 10% to 15% seasonality with those puts and takes.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I got you, helpful. And then, I apologize if this was already asked. But just a clarification, the 6% sequential growth without SiGe. Did you comment whether linear was up or down within that 6%?", "David J. Aldrich", "In September, linear was up.", "Operator", "The next question in queue will be from Nathan Johnsen for Pacific Crest Securities.", "Nathan Johnsen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Two quick ones. Just firstly, on the SiGe acquisition. I know you guys have basically incorporated that into the business. I wanted to see how that part of the business is tracking relative to expectations. And specifically, if you guys have seen any traction on smartphones with SiGe. I know traditionally, they had been more in laptops, but I think smartphones have been an opportunity. And then secondly, just on potential changes in the competitive environment, I'm just curious if you're seeing anything there. It seems like of Avago has picked up some steam on PAs and RDA seems to have gotten some good momentum in China. So I just wanted to see your view on competitive environment?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Nathan, this is Liam. With respect to the SiGe acquisition, it's going extremely well. The design win footprint is continuing to expand. And to your point, one of the real synergies with this deal was taking Skyworks sales and marketing presence across smartphones and tablets and some of the major Tier 1s, and leveraging the strong portfolio brought forth by SiGe. We're doing that today. A lot of that is not on the numbers yet. It will be more forward-looking into 2012. We now have traction and we can see design wins coming forward in tablets and in new smartphone accounts. There's a solid base business in gaming. We're starting to win in Internet-enabled TVs, Blu-ray players, just a whole proliferation of products. And earlier, we talked about margins. I can tell you that we are adamantly committed to raising the gross margin net portfolio to be at least as good as corporate average if not higher. And thus far, this has been a great deal. And I'll tell you that there'll be a lot more to tell you, a lot more about that as we move into 2012 and these design wins go into production.", "David J. Aldrich", "And in terms of the competition, Nathan. I think on the ultra low-end, we had an earlier question about pricing. And on the ultra low-end of the market, let's call sort of 2G mostly China, India, Central America. We have products, that's where we see the most competition. That's where we would see RDA for example. We have products that offer better performance. We also have what we believe the industry's lowest cost structure. We tend to go at the ultra low-end of the market where performance really doesn't matter that much. And we go at that whether these CMOS devices are ultra low-cost [indiscernible] devices. And then where performance becomes even a little bit more important, we tend to see more differentiation, less commoditization and it's easier for us to compete on the basis of performance. I think in the other aspects of the market, our relationship with the top OEMs, I think is pretty well-known and it's strong. One of the things that we have invested a great deal of money and time and energy has been in making sure that we not only have the best overall system performance, but we're there first with reference designs. We've done that more recently with Qualcomm. We tended to go at an OEM customer, use the relationship and our better overall performance and our history, our long history and track record to unseat an incumbent reference design player. We don't want to do that anymore because it hurts us sometimes. Occasionally, we don't win that battle, particularly with some customers who look at it and say look, I'm just following that reference design. I want the first part that works. And even though you have the strengths, I'm running with the reference design. We need to be better-positioned there and we are now, and we will continue to improve that in 2012. So that's where we see competition. You mentioned Avago, that's where we would see Avago being very strong with Qualcomm reference designs. We were less strong. We now believe we're a parity and we're improving that position as we move into 2012.", "Operator", "Moving along, we'll hear from Todd Koffman with Raymond James.", "Todd K. Koffman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Kind of a sort of clarification. You said the March quarter seasonality, you thought might be down 10% to 15% sequentially, or did I get that confused, Dave?", "David J. Aldrich", "No, that's right.  That's fairly normal, seasonal pattern in our industry, I'd say 10% to 15%.", "Todd K. Koffman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Dave, if it's down 10% to 15% in March, what do you think the industry, given that you're seeing weak demand from your customers now, what the industry seasonality for the December quarter might look like, which I'm guessing would be normally up 10% to 15% sequentially?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, you wouldn't -- and maybe not 10% to 15%. I mean that's a kind of an old market. There was a time when it was up probably firmly 10% to 12%. What we've seen lately, we've seen a little bit less overall seasonality because there's so many new platforms being delivered overall. And from a supply chain standpoint, the business we're in is that we tend to see a very strong September, October, November. Because that's when the stocking is occurring, that's when the building -- and even late August. So it tends to be sort of shared, the seasonal high points between late fiscal Q3 for us -- or late fiscal Q4 and early fiscal Q1 of the December quarter. But from a sell-through standpoint, in the March quarter, you typically see that number down in the 10% to 15%, in terms of the number of units sold. And the supply chain kind of follows that, as people sort of -- as our OEM customers recover from the seasonal high November, December timeframe and then restock.", "Operator", "And moving along, we will go to Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So I was wondering, we've talked a little bit about some of your other customers, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Samsung ,which you just touched on briefly. It seems like there are at least 2 or 3 of your competitors who have press releases out there tightening share gains there. And I was just wondering if you can give us your take on your share position at Samsung? And also, if you could just discuss a little bit of progress at Nokia?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, Samsung was sequentially up for us in September. They'll be sequentially up for us in December. And as Don mentioned, they're over 10% customer. And the specific design -- we've always been very strong at Samsung, and the specific designs we're talking about were on the Samsung II S Galaxy products. And the reason we talked about those is because first of all, they're very popular. They're selling very, very well. They're of very high performance. And it's an interesting example like I mentioned earlier, about reference design, we were not on the first reference design. That product, the early designs went fairly with an Infineon or Intel baseband chipset arrangement and we were not the reference design. As a result of the early rollout of those products, we weren't in those products. We were strong elsewhere, we were not in those products. We've recovered and as I mentioned earlier, we focused on the system-level performance and our strong relationships. And now we have gained the majority of those sockets. So I would say in the Galaxy platform, as we move through the end of fiscal Q1, at the end of December quarter and into the back half of 2012, we will be the majority player in those Galaxy platforms. And that augments what's always been a very strong position for us in their feature phone segment in the low-end. And we're pretty excited about that because we did not like being on the outside looking in. It relates to my comments earlier about, not only being the best overall architectural player, or competitor which has always allowed us to unseat the reference design incumbent. We want to be there with the best performance and we want to be there first, and we needed to fix that in the last couple of years and we're doing that. So I think you should expect on future Samsung products. We will not be having to displace the reference design incumbent. We'd rather be on the reference design.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes and let me also add, Jonathan that Samsung is going to be one of our first customers to ramp with a SiGe WLAN FEM, probably mid-2012. In addition to that, we also have launched a new portfolio of GPS products and we have design wins there. So those will be coming in second half of 2012, but the design win work has been cemented.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. I guess I'd add one further comment since we have a lot of questions about Samsung. We have always been Samsung's largest supplier of RF front-end for years. This Galaxy -- the Galaxy was so popular and since we weren't in the reference design. We didn't like, as I said, we didn't like our position there on that product. We worked very hard to fix that and we have now fixed that. So I think you will see, as we go through 2012, we will be and are the number one supplier going into Samsung.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then, I was wondering if you could comment on Nokia. I think they still make phones?", "Liam K. Griffin", "They make a lot of phones. Yes, I mean, Nokia continues to be a very important customer of Skyworks. We've been gaining share for quite a while. We like their new lineup of Windows Mobile phones. Our portfolio there goes all from the low-end to the mid-end to the smartphone space. We expect to be leveraging every aspect of our technology, from multi-mode designs, to low-end GSM, to WLAN, ASM and the whole portfolio. So we expect a good year at Nokia.", "David J. Aldrich", "We have a solid majority of the 2G products which for them, a very high volume. We had been writing, we've had to write down the Symbian portfolio which is kind of well-understood, but that was also where we had more than 50% share and that's not been a great performer as they've gone through that transition. But we have a great position on the Windows platforms.", "Operator", "Moving forward, we will go to Sanjay Devgan with Morgan Stanley.", "Sanjay Devgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "First question is just a quick clarification on the margin outlook for next quarter. Was that 44% to 44.5% or was that 44% to 45%", "David J. Aldrich", "No, 44% to 44.5%", "Sanjay Devgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "44.5%, okay. And then, I guess my follow-up question is looking at the margin profile next quarter as you -- slight tick down, is that more to do with mix. I'm assuming because you talked about weakness in wireless infrastructure, since those are marginally accretive, is that more to do with anything, given your in-line fabs are essentially fully-utilized? And then I guess beyond that, how should we look at margins going forward, is it -- will it be more of a function of mix, pricing or margin improvements in SiGe. I mean, if you can kind of talk to those 3, I'd really appreciate it?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I mean, the margin, if you look at where the margins are, we do have some reduced volume and revenue that always has some impact on the fixed cost structure. And we've got the layering in. And as Liam talked about with SiGe, the revenue contribution for SiGe and the margin associated with that is slightly below Skyworks' average and then there is some mix change within the infrastructure portfolio. On a go forward basis, we typically say -- and if you go back and look historically, what we contribute for every dollar of incremental revenue. We typically contribute 48% to 52%, so we don't see that changing. We don't see any mixed phenomena out there that's going to change our ability to continue to expand as we add revenue. And that's the right way to think about it and model it.", "Operator", "Next question will be from Dale Pfau with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "One of the things that I wondered, because of your debt to penetration at all your customers and so on, at what point do you just sort of follow the trajectory of the phone industry or maybe even the smartphone industry, because it's almost impossible to have 100% share sometimes even over 50% share there? And then my follow-up to that is, could you talk a little bit more in detail, about the competitive landscape out there, it looks like there's some shift, looks like we're going to see more shifts next year and how you see that playing out?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I think on the market share side, we're very fortunate to be in a business where the unit volumes continue to expand and the dollar content within those devices continues to expand even faster. So we've got more complexity which is driving despite ASP pressure. Normally ASP pressure, the dollar content continues to rise and the content for us continues to rise as we have now, successfully developed platforms that sits side-by-side with our traditional front-end module business like GPS, like our mobile connectivity and so on. So the market continues to grow. And our share, while it is the highest in the industry, we've got a lot of room to move. We've got a lot of upside potential here. I mean, there are sockets that we're going to go win. There are customers where we're definitely under-weighted in. There are basebands where we are extremely well lined up. And as I discussed, there are basebands where we're only now becoming sort of a formal preferred reference design partner, so we've got a lot of headway to continue to increase. And I think the competitive landscape, Dale, the second half of your question, continues to evolve the way I mentioned earlier. I think in the sort of low-end segment of the market which is getting smaller fortunately, because it's the lowest dollar content, we make money there, but it's the lowest dollar content. You see less performance-oriented, more price-competitive, more price-driven competitors and we compete there with a lineup that allows us to leverage our lowest cost structure. But then as you move up the food chain, it's increasingly performance, performance, performance, so the discrete -- completely discrete companies tend do get hurt and those that can play in various architectural choices of levels of integration, everything from a high-end converged multimode to something in between, a performance-oriented hybrid, to something that is more discrete and very high-performance. We're in each and every one of those sockets and we're finding our competitors to be increasingly niche. Good, but niche.", "Operator", "And moving along, we will hear from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Dave, you talked about -- you announced today the win at Samsung with the hybrid, the 77606 and 77604. I mean, I wanted to get some idea on timing on these parts. Have they -- are they considered new parts or they have been around production right from the beginning of the year? And I'm trying to focus on some of the displacement that you suffered at the hands of someone like Avago, were these parts in that mix or are they new, they seem to have gained some traction at Samsung and I'm just wondering how prevalent or how powerful they'll be in gaining share back or gaining new sockets in 2012?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, this is Liam. Well, the devices that were announced relative to Samsung are new products, but they're products that have been fully tested and characterized and they're market-ready. We've done a great deal of work with Samsung. As Dave noted, they're one of our leading accounts, so there's been a great deal of applications support and hand-holding as we've ramped those designs. And as you look at multimode, every customer, every baseband have their nuances. We certainly strive to maximize our exposure with many of these. And much of the time, the work is reference design-related. It's working very closely in the labs, characterization and getting the OEM-specific requirements married up with the baseband and our solutions, so it's a great deal of work across each one of those parties.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "So were these tools in your quiver, say, a year ago, or are they something that's production ready only in the last quarter or 2?", "Liam K. Griffin", "No, they\u2019re production ready in the last couple of quarters and they've gone to the design cycle here in the last several months. So I would say, not a year ago, but last several months.", "Operator", "At this time, we will hear from Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Most of my questions have been asked. But just -- I want to touch real quickly on the low-end kind of Chinese handset market if I could real quick. It sounds like RDA is taking -- RDA is doing pretty well in that market. I know you guys have Axiom as well, kind of attacking the low-end GSM markets. But I'm curious as to how you guys view kind of the emerging smartphone markets, especially in that geography. Are you guys well-positioned there and can you walk us through maybe how you view the next year for those low-end smartphones?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think the low-end smartphones is disruptive enough in that market that it really changes the customer set. I'll buy a lot and it definitely changes the supply chain. So I think the companies you're talking about who can compete on the low-end are not going to be successful. They're not nearly as successful on the high-end because it's not of our low. It's still -- even though it's a low-end smartphone, it's still a smartphone. So I think the performance degradation that customers get when they go to some of the companies you mentioned is not something that we're going to accept in the smartphone, maybe okay in kind of a very low-end feature phone, sort of very low-end 2G phone. I also think in the OEM base changes a little bit, because remember, there were literally hundreds of customers, indigenous suppliers in China that had availed themselves of complete service chipset providers like Mediatech and others. And those customers did okay in that market. They were able to have very few people low barrier to entry-level phones. It's not nearly as low a barrier-to-entry when you start talking about smartphone-s. I think it gives an opportunity for the traditional chipset players in China to come up with -- to continue to penetrate that market. But I think the OEMs will need -- the brands will need more investments. So I'd look at strength in big companies in that region, like maybe Huawei, maybe ZTE. I'd look at the foreign brands in Korea and elsewhere in North America to come in strong into that market, leveraging brand recognition and performance. So I think it changes it a lot.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "And so, David, my follow-up, if we start to see that market really take off, especially in those geographies, I mean, which I guess, most of what we're expecting it to. How do we view your dollar content going forward in that the mix changes towards more of those types of phones?", "David J. Aldrich", "The dollar content is really roughly 3x. It's fully 3x in even the lowest end smartphones and what one would expect to see in a low-end 2G or feature phone.", "Operator", "And at this time, we have no further questions in queue. I'll turn things back over to David Aldrich for any additional or closing remarks.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' First Fiscal Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating future results that are forward looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as result of certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Well, I'm pleased to report that we're off to a strong start to our 2012 fiscal year. Despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we have once again exceeded our prior guidance. Our first quarter financial performance demonstrates how our market diversification strategy and our focus on operational excellence continues to drive stronger financial returns for the company. And during the quarter, we delivered revenue of $394 million, that's ahead of our guidance of $390 million and up more than 17% year-over-year.", "We generated strong operating profits, producing first quarter operating income of $105 million and cash flow from operations of $77 million. We earned $0.51 in diluted earnings per share, and this is $0.01 better than our prior guidance. Also during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 750,000 shares of our stock, and we retired $9 million of our convertible debt. And following the close of the quarter, we further enhanced our balance sheet and eliminated dilution by retiring the remaining $17 million of our outstanding debt. This leaves us now completely debt free. And we successfully closed our acquisition of Advanced Analogic Technologies or AATI.", "But before delving into the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to first describe for you, in broad terms, some of the key dynamics we're seeing in our business environment today. And as I'm sure everyone is aware, the market backdrop remains challenging given the current global macroeconomic climate. But despite this, we have continued to generate strong profits and cash flow even while absorbing the impact of a product transition within one of our major customers. And furthermore, we believe that the trough of our business occurs in this quarter, in the March quarter. And there are 2 primary reasons that Skyworks has been able to navigate through these cross currents and to maintain our track record of strong financial results.", "The first is over the last couple of years, we have strategically positioned ourselves as a significantly more diversified company. Not just in terms of served markets but also in terms of our addressable content within these markets. And secondly, we maintained a relentless focus on being the most efficient operator in the space, leveraging our scale and leveraging our flexible manufacturing model. This dual-edge strategy has enabled us to perform during tough market conditions, but more importantly, positions us for substantial growth as the market environment improves.", "Now while the economic climate has created challenges in some of our segments, we saw a healthy holiday season demand across all categories of mobile Internet devices, including smartphones, e-readers and tablets. In fact, these were some of the season's biggest sellers. Recent market research suggest that a staggering 6.8 million new smartphones were activated on Christmas Day alone. With application downloads surpassing 242 million in one day.", "More broadly, there are a number of irrefutable market trends that are playing out today that are bullish indicators for a long-term industry fundamentals. The first is wireless data usage is exploding. Ericsson recently projected a tenfold increase in wireless network data traffic over the next 5 years as the mobile Internet supplants the wired Internet. Second, driving this usage, smartphones are proliferating on a global basis. Unit shipments are now expected to exceed 450 million during 2011, which still only accounts for less than 30% of overall handset unit shipments. In fact, some forecasts are predicting 4 billion cumulative smartphone unit shipments between 2011 and 2015. Furthermore, tablets are replacing PCs. More than 60 million tablets are estimated to have shipped during 2011, 60 million, with some projections calling for more than 100 million in 2012. The adoption rate of tablets and similar devices like ultrabooks should accelerate as applications like cloud computing and digital textbooks becomes mainstream. An increasing number of these are shipping with 3G and 4G connectivity, I might add.", "And finally, more and more consumer devices are going wireless. The number of wireless radios shipped into non-mobile segments like gaming, like PCs, televisions, like set-top boxes, crossed the 1 billion mark in 2011 and is expected to grow 27% compounded rate through the year 2015. But these are all quite positive trends for our company, for Skyworks, and will provide healthy growth in our core TAM for years to come.", "The proliferation of air interfaces, cellular frequencies and global roaming, dramatically increases front-end complexity, placing a premium on integration and a premium on performance. Quite incredibly, I think, today's smartphones can operate on as many as 12 different RF frequencies as compared to only a dual band 2G phone from just a few years ago. And we see the number of frequency bands only continuing to rise. In fact, we're now seeing architectures on the drawing board that incorporate a whopping, a staggering 23 bands, 23 frequency bands. So to be clear, this translates not only to higher average dollar content per mobile device but frankly fewer qualified suppliers with the engineering depth and the technical breadth to address these advanced RF design challenges. So at the highest level, we have positioned Skyworks as an enabler of mobile data in all its forms, and we believe we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on these megatrends.", "First, we have the broadest product portfolio in the industry by far today, which encompasses all RF architectures, including highly-integrated multimode PAs, power amplifier duplexers and hybrids of all forms supporting all standards. Second, and in a similar matter, we have deep relationships spanning all major device OEMs and all major baseband partners. None of our competitors have the breadth of engagement that Skyworks has today. And it's no coincidence that Skyworks is currently designed into every one of the world's leading smartphone and tablet platforms. Third, on top of this, we're now capturing incremental dollar content within mobile devices.", "We're having a great deal of success leveraging our strong customer relationships, leveraging our scale and technology advantages to drive additional expansion of our TAM with our portfolio of Antenna Switch Modules, or ASMs, diversity in band switches, wireless networking front-end modules spanning both 2 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz bands, GPS low-noise amplifiers and now, power management display -- power management and display and backlighting solutions. The end result is a target-rich environment for Skyworks within today's most advanced mobile devices where we are competing for as many as 7 or more addressable sockets per device.  So we're clearly not just a PA company, but rather a full-service RF and analog specialist focused on the mobile Internet and adjacent high-growth market opportunities.", "So let me give you a specific example how these opportunities can play out in the real world application. A recent teardown of the Galaxy Note from Samsung that was published by Chipworks highlights Skyworks as the supplier of the RF engine using our multimode, multiband SKY604 [ph] product. Further, the teardown revealed a complete suite of supporting Skyworks products, including our ASM or Antenna Switch Module, our band switches, our GPS LNA and a wireless networking front-end module. In total, we captured 5 sockets within this particular platform. And looking ahead, we only see this trend accelerating with more complex architectures as we incorporate more sophisticated signal processing, antenna tuning, advanced switching, multi-transmit chain, wireless LAN technologies and power management. With these incremental addressable opportunities, some of the upcoming platforms we're currently engaged on contain more than $10 of addressable content for Skyworks.", "Okay. Now switching gears, within HPA, our HPA business, or high performance analog products. We are also seeing increasing traction across a wider range of end markets, through both our catalog analog component products and our custom vertical market solutions. And this has been a key contributor to our ability to outperform. Specifically during the quarter, we captured numerous design wins across a number of diverse applications. Some of these include an entire lineup of General Electric smart appliances, including washers, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers and ovens. And we expect these products to ramp over the course of fiscal 2012.", "We've captured new content within a remote heart monitoring device from Medtronic, leveraging our portfolio of advanced tuning ICs. Land mobile radio applications for emergency responders utilizing up to 20 of our low insertion loss switch arrays and a new residential FEM tel platform using our fully integrated receiver subsystem. And with Ericsson, a TDD-LTE base station where our high-power transmit/receive switching module was incorporated. And wireless networking front-end modules for an ultrathin notebook platform with a leading OEM. This high-performance module features 3x3 MIMO connectivity and incorporates a total of 5 Skyworks devices. We think all of these wins clearly demonstrate our success in diversifying our business in the highly profitable adjacent market segments.", "And additionally, we continue to seek new avenues for expanding our high performance analog business. Last week, we closed our acquisition of Advanced Analogic Technologies, which provides us with an entree into an incremental $2 billion in TAM with power management ICs, with display and backlighting solutions. And AATI further strengthens Skyworks' technology leadership position with complementary new product, process and technologies, as well as a portfolio of nearly 300 patents and patent applications. And by combining AATI's leading edge product portfolio with Skyworks' strong sales channels, this acquisition further expands our product offering within the mobile Internet, but it also broadens our market footprint into exciting new growth markets like e-books, like digital cameras and cable modems and LED lighting, where AATI already has significant momentum and design wins.", "We're excited to have this acquisition complete as it opens up several new market opportunities and is accretive to our 2012 earnings. So in closing, our first fiscal quarter marked another solid performance for Skyworks in which we added to an already strong design win pipeline. We believe that our strategy of diversifying across baseband partners, across OEM customers and now new vertical markets, while capturing new dollar content and continuously improving operational execution, is clearly working.", "And with that, I'll now turn this over to Don for his financial review.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining us, everyone. We appreciate that. I will first provide a summary of our first quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. ", "Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $393.7 million, up more than 17% year-over-year. Gross profit was $174.4 million or 44.3% of revenue. Operating expenses were $69.3 million. That includes R&D the expense of $41.4 million and SG&A expense of $27.9 million, yielding $105.2 million of operating income and a 26.7% operating margin. Cash taxes were $8.9 million. That translates into an 8.5% tax rate, which is in line with our prior guidance. Net income was $96.2 million or $0.51 of diluted earnings per share, $0.01 better than our guidance.", "Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We generated $77.2 million in cash flow from operations. We also invested $6.4 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $17.3 million. We expect our CapEx to remain below depreciation levels until the second half of fiscal 2012 as we increase volumes. We produced free cash flow of $70.8 million, which implies a 9% free cash flow yield based on our recent equity value in our calendar 2011 free cash flow. We repurchased 750,000 shares of our common stock and $9 million of our convertible debt and exited the quarter with $446.5 million in cash. Following the close of the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of AATI for roughly $200 million in net cash. It is worth pointing out that we elected to pursue an all-cash structure for this transaction in order to avoid issuing equity. In addition, we repurchased the remaining of our 2007 convertible notes. We are pleased to report that we are now completely debt-free.", "Now for our second quarter 2012 business outlook. We are guiding second quarter revenue to be approximately $360 million, including roughly a $14 million stub contribution from the acquisition of AATI. Excluding AATI, our second quarter guidance reflects slightly better-than-normal seasonality. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin in the 43% to 43.5% range, which factors in the impact of the seasonally lower revenue base. Looking ahead, we see gross margins improving in the third quarter as sequential revenue growth resumes and as we realize synergies associated with the AATI acquisition.", "We expect second quarter operating expense to be in the range of $74 million to $75 million, including AATI expenses for the period. Below the line, we expect no contribution from interest income and other expenses. We expect our cash tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2012 to remain steady at around 8.5%. And as a result, we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $0.40 on a base of 189 million shares.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So, operator, go ahead and open up the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Alex Gauna from JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Dave, I was wondering if you could touch on some of the puts and takes during the quarter. What allowed you to exceed your guidance? And I was also wondering about linearity. And if you could touch on here visibility into Q1, I know you said it's a little bit better than seasonal. What are the puts and takes on that with regard to visibility on backlog, where we are in the uptick of LTE and also maybe where we are in wireless infrastructure spend?", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Well, Alex, I would say that it was reasonably linear this quarter. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary in the December quarter. December has a slightly different profile than others as you can imagine, but nothing out of the ordinary. I think some of the puts and takes, our business, with, for example, Samsung was very strong with the launch of new products. Our HPA business in general was quite good. Our home automation and mobile connectivity business performed very well. Our standard catalog business went along strong, was sequentially up for the quarter. We saw some softness in pockets of 2G open market China, which was offset by the introduction of 3G and some of the momentum we're seeing with customers like Huawei and ZTE. So I would say those were kind of the puts and the take -- puts and takes. Infrastructure was a little soft as well. I think in Q2, we expect kind of more of the same. It's a seasonally low quarter. I don't see anything out of the ordinary in terms of overall inventory. I still see choppiness in the low end of the market in China. I still see a lot of launches -- new launches we're participating in for 3G that are penetrating the same market. Tremendous amount of design activity, which I think bodes pretty well for the second half of the year.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "There was a large analog peer of yours that reported recently some more encouraging trends in terms of business picking up. Are you getting any glimmers of that would make you encouraged on the kind of broader semiconductor cycle?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Alex, this is Liam. Yes, we are seeing some signs of improvement across the broader landscape in HPA. The last -- the end of December seemed to get a little brighter. And as we get into the March quarter now, we feel like we have an ability here to perform very well against the to market. Our mobile connectivity, our wireless LAN portfolio looks very good. The Antenna Switch Module business, which is heavily weighted towards multiple modes and multiple bands across all RF applications is doing quite well. And then we are -- we believe that Infrastructure is going to start to pick back up. They had been soft, as Dave mentioned, in December. So we do see some encouragement there across the broader market.", "Operator", "We'll go to our next question from Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Dave, just wanted to get a feel for your design win pipeline. So if you look at your pipeline right now and compare it to your, say, 6 months back, do you see your design win momentum increasing? And do you think that you can grow faster than the market in the calendar 2012?", "David J. Aldrich", "I do see it increasing because there have been a great deal -- there's been a great deal of emphasis on incorporating bands of LTE, creating more world-based ubiquitous products, more tablet design activity where the complexity is very high. So I think that the basic trend of increasing content and all that, that implies from design win standpoint is very much alive and well. It had been playing out, now, relative to 6 months ago. And I think that trend will continue, frankly. I think you'll see that throughout 2012, 2013.", "Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And secondly, I mean, you hinted to your design win activity at LTE. How would you handicap your share in the LTE versus your competitors? And what do you think that you would be able to gain sockets in some of the upcoming Marquee [ph] LTE platforms?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, our sky-high LTE is now demonstrating, and in real world environment is showing really, I'm quite -- our customers are quite impressed with the power-added efficiency and the low-current consumption. We're seeing PAEs north of 50% for this product line. They're quite rugged. We've been sampling them for some time. They're in production. We've been picking up reference design sockets. I would say, we probably are in the 40% overall market share range in terms of the total business. I think LTE is going to be a similar platform for us. I expect very high growth and an awful lot of design momentum right now as carriers are demanding this, even in networks that don't have that -- that are not enabled with LTE, they want these products to have LTE.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. We're also seeing, in parallel, if you talk about infrastructure, the real driver right now in infrastructure is to put out that ecosystem and develop the carrier model to support high-frequency LTE. So you're starting to see a build-out with Ericsson, Nokia, Siemens, Huawei, names like that. So that's a little bit more back half of 2012, but that infrastructure is also rolling.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think probably as 2012 rolls out, we get into the late 2012, 2013, I think we will be by far the #1 producer of LTE. I think we will lead that space.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Nathan Johnsen with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Nathan Johnsen - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "On the LTE side. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about, in your guys' expectations for the year, how many or what percentage of smartphones do you expect to be LTE enabled? And then when you look at how many LTE bands kind of the typical LTE smartphone would support, I was wondering if you can give an idea whether they will typically be dual band LTE or if there's other variations that you see kind of dominating? And then secondly, just in terms of looking at the competition, clearly you've got a couple of competitors that are in underutilized situation, just wondering what your strategy is for keeping ASP pressure from bleeding [ph] into the mix in the mid-part of the year?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure. With respect to LTE timing, you are starting to see the initial launches across some of our OEMs. We think that the real excitement around LTE in the consumers' hands will occur later in 2012. You'll see it in smartphones, potentially even tablets, which will be an ideal platform. So that's one part here. In the second question that you had related to content, we are absolutely amazed with the number frequencies and the RF addressable content that we see in a typical LTE device. You'll often have 2 or 3 bands of LTE, maybe 4 bands of LTE, backward compatibility to WCDMA, where there could be another 3 or 4 bands, and then even an EDGE device. So when we speak of content of $8 to $10, it's absolutely true. It's power amplifiers. We bring in our ASM. We could also add wireless connectivity to 5 gig and 2.4 gig modules. But we are looking at the $8 to $10 of content in these devices.", "Donald W. Palette", "And, Nathan, as far as -- this is Don, on the pricing issue, there's been a lot of talk, you're right, from competitors in this space. And actually, we're not seeing anything unusual in the marketplace regarding pricing. Our current erosion and projected erosion is well within historical ranges. The ASP erosion is a market dynamic we're well accustomed to dealing with. And what's important is, now more than ever, this is not a commodity business, we're pricing along win share. I mean, customers are making decisions based on your product performance, technical capabilities and breadth. The baseband partnerships, you have scale and supplier reliability. Aggressive pricing really only works in the open market -- open China market, 2G. And as the low-cost producer in this space, we're in a much stronger position to manage this dynamic, and our financials consistently reflect that. So it's really that it's our ability to manage through that and our ability to have the products in place to take advantage of the requirements that the customers need. And it's just we don't see any different dynamic than we've been used to dealing with over the last [indiscernible].", "David J. Aldrich", "And, Nathan, furthermore, to add what Don said, underutilization in this space is not a function of bad pricing decisions. It's a product issue. So if you -- there's plenty of market demand to fill capacity. We've been incrementally adding it. So I think if you look at where there are pockets of excess capacity, it's a product issue, it's not a pricing problem.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I had a few questions. Can you talk about your revenue concentration in your cellular business now that outside of Samsung and Apple it seems like every other vendor is stumbling. Sony Ericsson, bad numbers. Motorola, bad numbers. HTC, bad numbers. Can you tell us what -- how many 10% customers, how many 20% customers you have in your cellular business? And how do you expect that to change going forward?", "Donald W. Palette", "Ittai, this is Don. The 10%, which is a number that we talk about on a quarterly basis, it was Foxconn, Samsung and Nokia, consistent with what it's been over the last multiple quarters. So that did not change in the quarter.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And have any of them been above 20% at least without calling who?", "Donald W. Palette", "No.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And with regards to your guidance, so $14 million is coming from AATI. A, can you give us a little bit more color why such a low number? This is a company that typically does in the mid-20s. And since the deal closed on January 10 are you just being overly conservative here, just feel that, that number should be higher? And also on the gross margin, AATI gross margins in the upper 40s, why should we see a decline in gross margin in your second quarter. Why should not we actually see flat if not up?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, the AATI in the December quarter was around $15 million and change, it was around $16 million. Our $14 million, remember there was a stub period here, so our $14 million is only part of the quarter. So if you really go back in time, it's been some time since they were in the mid-20s. They've been running at sub-20. And I think if you look at the analog peers in the power management space, they've seen some pretty significant downturns, and AATI has not been immune to that. So I think that our guidance is pretty consistent with how they've been running since the market for these products sort of corrected a little bit. The other thing that we're doing is we are looking very, very hard at the product portfolio and making sure that we launch this business where we have the most competitive advantages. So we are doing some product line pruning and expect AATI to be emerging much stronger as we go through that process, which began when we closed last week.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My question is, I think on the pricing issue, you addressed the competitive pressures before. But I'm curious, Dave, what role is technology integration playing in pricing where multiple bands are being integrated? You have these multimode amplifiers, you have the conversion amplifiers. So what role is that integration playing in the pricing dynamic?", "David J. Aldrich", "That's a great question, Vivek. So the way we look at that is that our customers today are, as you can imagine, really struggling with all the shielding and interference and filtering problems created by so many bands. And really, it's quite impressive to see this level of complexity given the current consumption requirements, the battery voltage issue, size, real physical size. And so what our customers are jumping to as quickly as we can provide it, as the industry can provide it, is some way to preserve performance as measured by battery talk time, among others, while at the same time just enabling the number of bands. So we see a steady march where each successive generation, for the most part, in general, has higher dollar content. That doesn't mean higher content per band. So the way to play this is we're able to integrate where we have some relatively modest incremental cost as we add more functionality, but our customer gets the value of not having to replicate the cost for each discrete band. So we get more dollar content. They get a more affordable band. They get a more integrated device, which takes up less size, and most importantly, consumes no more current or less current, hopefully. So the game is very much thinking of microprocessor business, right? We're adding functionality, which is keeping us ahead of the overall ASP curve, while adding value, enabling them to have more complexity that they can afford, that the market can afford. Now the fact is, as we said in the prepared comments, the ability to do that is limited to a very small handful of suppliers, which is very, very good for us, stable for pricing. And as Liam mentioned, we're adding a great deal of more content. We really love the fact that now when we go to an engagement, it's not just a multimode PA with discrete bands of LTE bolted on, it's an Antenna Switch Module, it's a 5-gig PA module incorporating backward compatibility to 2.4 on WiFi, it's a GPS product. And this is not a dream of ours. We're doing that right now. You're going to see products today that you can buy on the shelf that have all that content of Skyworks, unheard of a year ago.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And one follow-up, Dave. So one of your competitors, Avago, has very -- I have to say, very differentiated FBAR and voltage technology that they have been able to leverage and they have had a very good relationship with Qualcomm and on CDMA in the past. Just to conceptually, does a lack of an FBAR filter hurt you from a long-term perspective? And I know that you're looking at partnerships, but how do you look at that competitive threat long term?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, we've talked about this before, and it's playing out pretty quickly. First of all, FBAR technology is a great technology. The problem is that these filters are becoming increasingly multiband and low, medium and high band. And so SAW filter from a price performance is absolutely a requirement. So what we're finding is FBAR is great for certain high-frequency applications. But more and more on our customers' roadmap and our roadmap is the combination of these bands that are making a single technology not sufficient. So what we've been doing is we have been partnering with companies who view us the -- remember, we're the best in the PA space. We're the biggest in PA space. We're also -- I think, we're the best, we're the biggest by far. And so the filter providers in the world view as a wonderful partner to them and an entree to the market. So we are not -- these are not our roadmap. We are in high-volume production and we are winning PAD sockets of single band, multiband and their low, medium and high frequencies. So while we think FBAR is a great technology, so is SAW. It has a different performance characteristic, and we intend to play across the entire suite. And you'll increasingly see that if you crack open smartphones in 2012.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Todd Koffman with Raymond James.", "Todd K. Koffman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Can I just ask a follow-on to the comments you made on AATI? I think you said they did around $15 million in December, $14 million for March. They were doing comfortably north of 20 for many, many quarters. Is there something about their business that you've changed or you've gotten out of or is permanently impaired? Or do you expect to get their business back to what they were doing in 1 or 2 quarters?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, first of all, December -- Don, December was $15.7 million, just under $16 million. This quarter is $14 million for part of the quarter, we didn't own it for the whole quarter. And what was the September quarter, Don, do you your recall?", "Donald W. Palette", "About $20 million.", "David J. Aldrich", "About $20 million. So they really have been a 20 or sub-20 for now going on 9 months. And as I mentioned earlier, we think that's a function of the power management space in which they compete. You've seen other -- you've seen their competitors do pretty much the same thing. But we're also tuning up that product line, very much like we did with SiGe, we really expect to be able to put them on the right trajectory because we're adding our scale, our cost structure and our ability to bundle and integrate. And we feel very, very good about that acquisition. But it's not correct that they've been in the mid-20s. They've been 20 to sub-20.", "Todd K. Koffman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I thought the September quarter was $22 million, and the June quarter was $24 million, but maybe I have numbers wrong. Just an unrelated question, if you look at the margins of your business in the last, I don't know 3 or 4, 5 quarters, the gross margins, operating margins, they have now flattened out at a very attractive level. But you're continuing to put up fairly, very healthy growth rates. And I was wondering as we go forward, you signaled that you thought the gross margins might lean higher through the year. Are we now at a point where the margins are likely capped and the business can grow with the top line or that's not the case?", "Donald W. Palette", "Todd, this is Don. That's absolutely not the case. We're going to be -- our expectation is to continue to deliver the margin expansion. It will be in step with revenue growth. It is volume- and revenue-dependent, but we've got the opportunities to drive the expansion clearly defined and they include the increasing dollar content as the migration of more complex architectures continues, we're going to leverage a hybrid manufacturing model with engineering focused on low-cost designs. We're making targeted productivity improvement CapEx investments, and we're going to grow the HPA business. All those things are going to continue to move the margins forward. And I do want to point out, I mean, if you look at the incremental changes that we've built the model off, if you look at the margin change from the December to the March quarter, we guided, that's about a 50% drop, which is what you would expect. Now there is some short-term pressure that you've seen with the 2 acquisitions. We have said they were a little bit, SiGe was a little bit below corporate average. We're moving that forward. We said the target is by the end of this year that they're going to be at or above Skyworks' averages. So when you've added some of this incremental revenue, it just put a little bit of pressure on it. But there's really nothing inherently different in the model. That's the takeaway.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis, Barclays Capital.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A couple of questions. When you mentioned the Galaxy Note, obviously there's 2 parts in there, the MMPA, you've addressed a little bit and then the Antenna Switch Modules. Just on the MMPA or the converged market, clearly that's with Infineon. I think Qualcomm is clearly moving to this. Just any perspective as to what percentage of the market is going to move these architectures then kind of the competitive view. I think everybody, at this point, has kind of some multimode PAs. And then just any comments on your switch business, kind of any relative, how big that is for you today and what your pipeline is?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, the switch business is small for us today because only entered the ASM business in 2011. That's where the action is. As I say, we've had a lot of discrete switches -- our market discrete switches has been very high for us, multiband discrete switches. We've moved that portfolio over to a great deal of SOI incorporated -- silicon-on-insulator -- incorporated filter technology and we've now been producing ASMs, and we're getting really good traction for those products. They're very important on the receive side, insertion loss and how they  impact current consumption. And again, the challenge is multibands, and we're quite good at that. So in fact some of these devices have 10-throw switches in them, unheard of a couple of years ago. I think Multimode is continuing to have its play. But remember these are -- these MMMB devices are really hybrids that will have bands of LTE bolted on to them. So picture this device and others like it, could have MMMB, could have bands of discrete or PADs and ASM. This product has a GPS LNA, has a 2.4- and a 5-gig WiFi module. So I think, in general, converged is going to continue or multimode will continue, but it will be part of a hybrid front-end architecture because the performance requirements are so high.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Dale Pfau with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Could you give us a rough breakdown of your HPA business compared to your wireless business? And then my follow-up is on operating margin of the SiGe and the AATI business, I know you said on SiGe, you thought that the margins would come up. Could you talk about operating margins and where you think those are going to be relative to your overall business by the end of the year, Don?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, the breakout is 30% HPA this quarter and 70% handset smartphones, which is consistent with where it was last quarter. And the follow-up on the SiGe operating margins. We don't -- it's a business segment for us. It's rolled into our mobile connectivity business, and it's clearly important part of the business going forward, but it is in a business that we report separate margins on. The only point I was making is we were cleared in the acquisition and if you've followed them in some of their filings, you saw that their product margins and operating margins were partly [ph] below corporate average. And we said we have a specific target in place, which we're well on track or for those to be at or above Skyworks' averages by 2012.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And how about on AATI, same thing?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, it's a similar story. They have a little higher product margins. But when you add in at the revenue level, their operating expenses that they had, it was a little bit below the overall Skyworks return. But again, the plan in place to drive margins forward, we've made some targeted OpEx reductions, and all that combined, we think again is within 3 quarters or so after the acquisition, we're going to be very close, if not, at the Skyworks' operating margins.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from Aalok Shah, D.A. Davidson.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Don, just a couple quick housekeeping questions. in terms of AATI, I think you guys said revenues in the September quarter were, I think, what, fixed in the teens. In the 10-Q that I just pulled up, it looks it's $22 million. Can you tell me what happened between September and December to see a 27% dropoff in revenue?", "Donald W. Palette", "I said that we're talking about December quarter, they were $16 million.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay.", "David J. Aldrich", "September, I believe, they were around $21 million.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, still $20 million to $21 million. Yes, so that's the number you're referring to. No, the $16 million was what we we're saying is they were $16 million in December and basically flat sequentially. And the difference between the $16 million and $14 million is the $2 million stub period, what we own them. That's...", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "And do you guys believe this is a trough level for them as well? I mean, how -- because that's a pretty big dropoff between September and December for them.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I mean, the September to December decline, a lot of that was market-driven. It was a pretty challenging quarter for the analog group in general. If you looked at some of the power management players, I think AATI endured the same headwind. As we bring that portfolio into Skyworks, we certainly think that we can expand the addressable customer set dramatically, alright? We have tremendous position across all the Tier 1 OEMs. We like the technology. We think power management is a very core expertise and competency to have and the IP there is significant. So we absolutely believe we're going to be able to grow the business. We've rightsized the OpEx. We can leverage a great sales channel. I think our operational team here at Skyworks is world-class. They'll be a part of the story. And we'll be, hopefully, reporting more good news to you as we go forward.", "Operator", "And Sujeeva De Silva with Think Equity has the next question.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "What was the percent of 2G versus WWE this quarter?", "Donald W. Palette", "It was 25% 2G and 75% EDGE/WCDMA.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "And then also perhaps for Dave, it seems like you have a lot of products that go along with the power amplifiers for the handset. Do you get a benefit from your power amplifier being in the design when the sockets or are the wins relatively independent from each other?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, no. It's absolutely a bundling benefit. If I take the SiGe as an example, not only we're able to sort of tune-up, if you will, the product portfolio but by presenting it to those individuals sourcing and engineering within our customers where we have a long history, they went from sort of a small company where customers will work about engaging in these high-volume sockets to one of which they had confidence. So there's an immediate bundling and I think -- supply-chain reputation advantage that then becomes a product advantage in some cases. So we were able to take our mobile connectivity business and theirs, our experience with SLI, their experience with SLI, our packaging experience. We were able to drive some pretty compelling multiband WiFi devices an example. I think the -- if you look at AATI, if you look at what they're doing with camera flash drivers, for example, in smartphones. They're doing it with LG and Samsung and HTC. We think we have an opportunity to take those to other customers where they were kind of boxed out based upon scale.", "Liam K. Griffin", "We also have -- as you know, Sujee, we come from a deep experience, systems-level experience at Skyworks. So our engineering teams, our applications folks, coupled with the sales guys are able to really go in and architect optimal solutions. We understand the current budget for our customers. We know where we can apply some of that budget to 5-gig WiFi, some of that to multimode PA. And I think our ability to kind of work collaboratively with the customer has been really helpful.", "David J. Aldrich", "I'll give you an example. When we introduced a family of ASM products, quite recently, one thing we were able to do was we're able to put the hands onto design benches and into platforms for them to test immediately across all our top customers. They didn't all buy it, some did, but I think that's a tremendous advantage that these smaller companies lack.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "AATI had, call it, 3 customers in the wireless side. Given your scale, Liam, how quickly do you think you could add significantly more customers? Also, Liam, if you wouldn't mind talking about 2x2 and 3x3 MIMO, the kind of content jump that you expect to see in 2012 and how you think that plays out?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Well, with respect to AATI, I mean one of the things you said is exactly attracts us. As you probably observed, they have really done well with a small set of customers, and they've done real well. Their share has been high. We think we can replicate that model across all of our Tier 1 accounts. We like -- in general, I think the market for LED drivers backlighting more screens in one's hand, right? From TVs to smartphones to tablets, there's a TAM opportunity across-the-board and their customer set has been very narrow. Their camera flash technology, we think, is outstanding, yet it's only playing in a few accounts. I think they lack the scale. They lack the sales channel to really penetrate some of the other big drivers out there from a customer perspective. We think we can turn that around. With respect to MIMO technology. If you look at what's happening in wireless LAN, that is an area where it's been explosive growth for us. It's been a performance-driven market as Dave articulated. We see the same thing in cellular. And basically, a 2x2 MIMO is 2x the content of a 1x1. It's linear. A 3x3 is 3x the content. So you get multiple inputs, multiple outputs, multiple radios and multiple bands. And we see that trend moving forward as video becomes more important to the user.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "One last quick the question. Can you talk about reference design activity on the LTE side?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. We're engaged with all the significant players that would be porting LTE, of course, Qualcomm, Infineon Mobile and others. We have a great portfolio. We have OEM relationships. As Dave mentioned before, we have the R&D horsepower and the application savvy to make sure the best-in-class products are appropriately positioned with the leading baseband providers, and that ultimately will flow through to the OEMs.", "Operator", "We'll take the next question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity research.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "A couple of questions. You pointed to the proliferation of bands and modes in these phones getting to some very high-teen rates for the largest ones. I think just about every OEM is looking at deploying some form of MMPA in 2012. But the pricing for most of these devices seems to be less than the sum of the parts. I know, for example, the Avago part that went into Apple, which is the 3-Di [ph] part, is less than the sum of that part. And some of the pricing we're hearing from Samsung is a similar trend. So the question is, as we move to these converged and hybrid devices, won't we expect to see a significant increase in overall TAM compression? And if so, are you going to make that up through some of the other parts like the Antenna Switch Modules you spoke of in the SiGe acquisition and maybe some of the stuff out of AATI?", "David J. Aldrich", "Ed, I will say that on average, it's absolutely the case. On average. That as more bands are being added, the TAM is up. So there are couple of examples, where that hasn't been the case. But on average, that -- overall, that's not the case. As more bands have been added, as the transition from feature phones to smartphones, the TAM is up, and not up a little bit, up substantially. There aren't that many smartphones today that aren't engaging in not only multimodes, multiband for 3G but also 4G and all the content it implies it bolts around it. I mean, yes, there's a PA. You can integrate bands in the PA, but you've got to figure out the filtering, the switching, the receive side and it's very complicated, the ASM is higher. So I think there will be more multimode.  We welcome multimode because we think that by moving from a discrete implementation to more higher levels of integration, the competitive landscape gets much narrower. Much narrower. And you see that as we're now competing typically in our larger sockets with our customers. If we're competing with -- we're competing with one other company usually. And that company differs from standard to standard, and we like that a lot. We like to see the nature of the competition getting a little bit more niche-y as we become more broad.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. Let me add, Ed, to that. And if you look at what's happening in the China, we talk about the China market contracting and being a difficult base for pricing. But while we see that $1 ASP market go down, we see more plays with Huawei and ZTE and HTC now bringing on 2 smartphones that are $3, $4, $5 in content. So in addition to the net unit-to-unit TAM increase that we see in a given smartphone portfolio, we're seeing the subscriber base gravitate towards smartphones at a much faster rate. And there's still a big upside there in emerging markets.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "That was my follow-on question there. Indeed, like you [ph] -- we've seen the massive increase in content just on bands alone with those additional modes. But we only have maybe 3 models out there that are converged now. You've got Link Co [ph]. You got the Galaxy parts out there. Apple's got a part out there. So we've only got maybe 2 or 3 models that have been using hybrids, much less converged. So I guess the question is, as, let's just pretend overnight that every handset OEM puts half of their phones on the block for converged or MMPAs, I guess what you're saying is, that wouldn't be enough to offset this 1 to 2 bands going 2 to 3 bands in the massive phones. There are still...", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, that's right. The upgrade cycle from feature phones to 3Gs and smartphones is always an increase in content that's rather significant. And even among the company -- we talked about in our prepared comments what's going on at Samsung today. In those products there's a lot more RF content in those products than one they replaced. A lot more. And we have the advantage of sitting here and designing products that are late 2012, 2013, and I will tell you, the average content is substantially higher.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Sanjay Devgan on with Morgan Stanley.", "Sanjay Devgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "First question, just kind of dove-tailing off the question on MIMO and wireless LAN, you talked about the content uplift for going 2x2 to 3x3. I wanted to get your thoughts on 802.11ac. I know it's kind of nascent, but we've heard some folks in the ecosystem talk about ac and potentially rolling out ac solutions to access points and I'm guessing eventually to handsets. I was wondering how that plays into you guys in terms of a content adder? And then second question is, just on AATI, now that you've done the SiGe acquisition, you've done AATI, was wondering how difficult -- it's obviously there's a revenue synergy opportunity in terms of leveraging the customer bases for each company, but on an R&D basis, how difficult is it to leverage engineering resources across different process technologies, i.e. gallium arsenide, CMOS, silicon germanium. If you can talk about that and what kind of R&D synergies can we expect to get from that?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Okay, okay. Let me start with wireless LAN. Yes, you absolutely nailed it. A very key move for us in technology. The 802.11ac space is really the next upgrade cycle in wireless LAN. It would be what LTE is to cellular, 802.11ac is to WiFi. We have an outstanding position in that category. We are partnered up very closely with Broadcom, one of the leaders in the chipset space. This technology is really made perfectly for video distribution and video communication, higher data rates, higher performance. We think it's going to be a great new category and an extension of WiFi. It will raise the TAM. It will raise the performance requirements, be deployed in access points. I think on the receive side, you're going to see this technology in tablets and TDs. We feel real good about it. You'll see more releases from Skyworks this year. And with respect to AATI and R&D, one of the advantages that we have at Skyworks in that we are a technology leader, we're also a manufacturer. We have fabs in-house, we have partners outside and we have a team is here that is well-equipped to manage the most complex engineering tasks. So as we bring this company in, and we make some changes to OpEx and work on portfolio management, there'll be a lot of leverage from the talent pool within Skyworks today to lean into this technology to support ongoing R&D efforts. So you're going to actually see an increase in the ability to deliver complex products as this company comes inside.", "Operator", "We'll take a follow-up question from Ittai Kidron.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Don, I wanted to ask about your CapEx comments. I think you mentioned, if I got that right, that in the second half of the year, your CapEx is going to start rising above your depreciation. Can you give us a little bit more color on that? And for how long should we assume CapEx would be above depreciation and by how much?", "Donald W. Palette", "Just to frame that. With what we spent in Q1 and where we're projecting Q2, we're going to be in roughly $20 million, maybe a little over $20 million in CapEx. And Q2 is the trough, and as the market continues to rebound, and we think we continue to gain share and strengthen our position, that's going to mean some incremental CapEx investment, but it's not a significant amount above those levels.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And as far as your OpEx is concerned, clearly your OpEx now includes AATI. But under the assumption that working quite aggressively right now to reduce that headcount, should we expect OpEx to be flat for the next 2, 3 quarters, down potentially for the next 2, 3 quarters?", "David J. Aldrich", "No, that forecast does include the AATI operating expenses that will move forward with post-synergies after the acquisition. But there will be -- we're adding some targeted headcount for opportunities in the second half and there's some other expense drivers where you really take the Q2 forecast. You need to model some increase into that in the second half of the year. But it won't be material, but you do need to add some increases to that.", "Operator", "And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Well, thank you very much for participating, and we look forward to seeing you all at the upcoming conferences.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti ", "Thanks, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Third Fiscal Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with the business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Well, I'm pleased to report that Skyworks posted another strong performance during our third fiscal quarter, in which we again exceeded prior guidance and we outpaced our addressable markets. Our diversification into new adjacent analog products and in complementary vertical markets, along with an intense focus on operational excellence, have enabled us to produce consistently strong operating results through a variety of market conditions. And from where we stand today, we're well positioned to extend our track record of outperformance.", "Turning to the third quarter results. We posted revenue of $389 million, better than our prior guidance of $383 million. We produced third quarter operating income of $91.8 million, and we earned $0.45 in diluted earnings per share. This is $0.01 better than our original guidance.", "Globally, consumer appetite for smartphones, for tablets, data cards and an array of other mobile Internet devices remains high, driven by the boom in social networking and driven by an accelerating shift towards cloud-based content, by mobile computing displacing traditional PCs, and the growing popularity of photo-sharing applications like Flickr, Instagram and Picasa, and the explosion in video conferencing and streaming video. These global themes are in the early stages of adoption and should provide a tailwind for our business for years to come.", "So while the long-term trends for us are clear, there's no denying that more recently, the macroeconomic climate and other factors have skewed normal demand patterns within the industry. Skyworks' ability to maintain consistently strong growth and operating results in spite of this is the result of key 3 factors -- or 3 key factors. First, new vertical market opportunities. The opportunity for Skyworks is quickly expanding. It's well known that broadband connectivity is proliferating across a growing array of previously unconnected consumer electronics. What's more, the need for high-performance analog solutions is expanding into brand-new markets like medical, automotive, military and industrial.", "Second, the rising RF content per device. This is driven by a dramatic increase in the number of LTE-enabled devices and a major smartphone upgrade cycle just beginning in the emerging markets. Average RF dollar content per device continues to move higher. This creates a rising tide for the foreseeable future and translates into TAM growth rate significantly above unit growth. This is playing out real time today across major development platforms on which we're engaged.", "And third, expanding our product portfolio between -- beyond traditional served markets. Through a combination of internal developments and targeted acquisitions, we have added an incremental $2 to $3 of addressable content per device to our core RF TAM. Today, we're seeing tremendous traction by cross-selling these new products throughout our existing customer base. It's worth noting that none of these products were in our portfolio just 18 months ago.", "So in short, we have strategically positioned the company to outperform our addressable market, independent of underlying market conditions, and we remain quite optimistic about the second half of 2012 and beyond.", "Looking ahead, we see our target markets continuing to expand for many years to come. And for example, industry analysts project that over the next 5 years, mobile broadband users will grow at a 38% compound rate. In fact, tablet shipments alone could reach more than 350 million units within the next 3 years according to recent reports by Morgan Stanley.", "And wireless connectivity is becoming the critical link to enable access to a growing library of cloud-based content, including music, online media and publications, on-demand video, personal photos, home movies and enterprise data. And the recent introduction of a -- of family data plans from major network operators will allow an increasing number of devices per household to enable shared access to cloud content on an anytime-anywhere basis.", "However, one of the greatest challenges facing mobile device OEMs within this landscape is managing escalating RF complexity. And this is resulting from the proliferation of air interface technologies, including 2G, 3G and 4G cellular, dual-band wireless local area networking, Bluetooth, GPS and Near Field Communications.", "The number of cellular bands alone is increasing exponentially. In fact, we see upcoming smartphone platforms that will support more than 14 different bands, each requiring distinct amplification, filtering, switching and shielding. All of this is happening in smaller form factors with increased battery life requirements, while trying to manage bond costs.", "This increasing complexity plays directly into Skyworks' core strengths and uniquely positions us to address these challenges. Today, we're providing the broadest portfolio of RF and analog solutions right from the transceiver to the antenna. We're offering an unmatched technology portfolio that includes deep expertise in SOI, high power, CMOS, HBT, pHEMT, BiFET and silicon germanium, along with a library of nearly 1,000 patents and supporting intellectual property. We maintain unrivaled scale and world-class facilities for integrating multiple technologies into highly sophisticated multiple chip -- multichip modules.", "And finally, we're leveraging a deep heritage in system-level design and a global force of system and applications engineers often deployed within steps of our customers' facilities. These competitive advantages took years to put in place and facilitate the highest level of integration and better system performance, ultimately providing more value to our customers.", "A prime example of how we leverage these core competencies to extend our technology leadership is the recent introduction of our SkyOne platform. SkyOne is a revolutionary patented front-end system that incorporates all of the RF and analog content between the transceiver and the antenna into a single ultracompact device. This is a complete system in a package, incorporating multiband amplifiers, supporting global 2G, 3G and 4G coverage, along with all associated filtering, duplexers, switching and control functionality in less than 1/2 the footprint of even the most advanced approaches in the industry today.", "The end result is significant board space savings, ease of implementation, high performance and time-to-market advantages for our customers. In these types of applications, we see a much narrower competitive landscape. Looking ahead, we expect to extend our technology lead as we introduce solutions incorporating sophisticated RF signal processing, more complex switching and even higher levels of integration.", "Okay, so turning now to specific third quarter product highlights. Across our mobile customer base, we've seen tremendous traction in cross-selling our portfolio of new analog product lines, alongside our traditional RF front-end components. In some recently launched models, Skyworks has secured a total of 7 or more devices, including multimode power amplifier, Antenna Switch Modules, camera flash, DC-DC converters, high-efficiency LTE amplifiers, backlighting ICs, GPS low-noise amplifiers and wireless LAN front-end modules. This level of content was unheard of for us just a couple of years ago.", "Outside of mobile devices, we are also captured new design wins across a number of diverse applications within our high performance analog products group. These include wireless LAN sockets on a recently introduced ultrathin high-end notebook PC, which includes a total of 9 Skyworks parts. This includes a receiver protection module within a heart monitor application with Medtronic, a high sensitivity mixers for an automotive toll tag application and major set-top box win containing multiple Skyworks components, including the switch matrix and low-noise amplifier modules.", "And finally, the first 802.11ac router products are now commercially available, containing up to 6 Skyworks devices per router. In total, we've already secured over 20 design wins across a variety of 802.11ac-enabled devices, including routers, set-top boxes, notebook PCs and USB dongles.", "So in closing, our third quarter marked another strong performance for Skyworks. We believe that our strategy of continuing to diversify our business, expanding into new verticals and maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working.", "With that, I'll now turn it over to Don for his financial review.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining us, everyone, today. We appreciate that. Well first I'll provide a summary of our third quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2012.", "Revenue for the third fiscal quarter was $389 million, which was up 7% sequentially and more than 9% year-over-year. Gross profit was $168.1 million or 43.2% of revenue. Operating expenses were $76.3 million, consisting of R&D expense of $48.6 million and SG&A expense of $27.7 million, yielding $91.7 million of operating income and a 23.6% operating margin.", "Cash taxes were $5.7 million, and that translates into a 6.2% tax rate. Net income was $86.1 million or $0.45 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.01 better than our guidance.", "Turning to our third quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We generated $44 million in cash flow from operations, and that brings us year-to-date to a total of $244 million.", "We exited the quarter with $327.9 million in cash, and we invested $31 million in capital expenditures during the third quarter, with depreciation of $17 million. The elevated levels of capital expenditures are a result of our continuing capacity expansion across all of our facilities to support second half product ramps. And as a reminder, these investments consist of equipment adds when our existing facilities gave a very quick payback and they enhanced our return on invested capital.", "Now for our fourth quarter 2012 business outlook. We are guiding the fourth quarter revenue to be $415 million to $420 million. At this revenue level, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 43% to 43.5%. Looking ahead, we see gross margins continuing to improve as we realize synergies associated with our recent acquisitions and as we capture the margin benefits of some of our recent capital investments.", "We expect the fourth quarter operating expense to be approximately $77 million. And below the line, we expect $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 6.5%. And as a result, we expect EPS of $0.50 to $0.51 using a base of 193.5 million shares.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So, operator, go ahead and open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "First is a clarification. Looking at the quarter's performance, you were $6 million above your guidance. Don, can you tell us how that broke out between either strength on the cellular part of the business or linear products business or was it strength in both that did the results?", "Donald W. Palette", "It was really strength in both. We didn't see a significant shift in the percentage revenue slip between the 2, so that increase was really split fairly evenly as we normally would see between those 2 segments.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so you're still at 65-35 per year?", "Donald W. Palette", "Correct.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the question I think on the last call, one of the things you indicated is you expected an above seasonal revenue profile in the back half of the year. Is that still the expectation? And can you just remind us what calendar fourth quarter seasonality would be for you?", "David J. Aldrich", "Craig, this is Dave. Well, we think there'll be traditional seasonal strength. However, in our space, we're starting to see more and more rather than a simple Q4 growth strength, that being split between the September and the December quarters as we shift into those builds. It's a bit too early to tell what March seasonality might look like a normal seasonality. We have no reason to believe it will be terribly different, but we're feeling good about, again, about those second half ramps.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Dave, you mentioned the word diversification many times. I was wondering if you could talk about diversification on 2 sides. Side one, how are you diversifying in your customer base outside of the Apples and Samsungs of the world? And then secondly, diversification in terms of sockets. Is there a way to get -- to size what your addressable content was last year versus what it is now?", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay, good questions, Vivek. First, with respect to sockets, one of the things, you probably seen some reason Teardown report, so I think that's probably the best testament to what we've been able to accomplish. We -- you may think of us as a traditional kind of a PA supplier -- PA switch supplier, but in the more recent designs, we've been getting increasingly attach rate -- high attach rates with our GPS LNA products, with our Antenna Switch Modules, with some power management devices, camera flash devices and our wireless LAN portfolio. And so we're seeing as much as more than $2 of incremental content per smartphone and tablet, and we're pretty excited about that. So we are leveraging not only recent acquisitions, but some organic development to continue to look to bolt on to what's been our traditional product offering more and more content. It helps our customers in the process, terrific for us.  We're also diversifying into new adjacent markets, and I think we've talked about that fairly extensively. But medical, for example, we talked about medical devices being designed in on the call. We're in infrastructure. We're in various home automation markets that are extremely exciting and growing. And I think from a customer standpoint, there isn't a customer in the cellular smartphone space that isn't a customer of Skyworks. So we're designed into every baseband suppliers, to offering as a reference design partner, and we're also designed into virtually every OEM.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And one follow up on operating expenses and operating margins. What is the progress in integrating your acquisitions? When can we expect to see operating margins get back to your traditional levels of 26%, 27%?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, this is Liam. Well with respect to the acquisitions, we are making great progress through the integration synergies, improvements in margin and also customer traction. So we're doing the right things there as outlined in the past, and I think we'll see continued performance going forward.", "Donald W. Palette", "And, Vivek, to follow-up on how that affects the overall Skyworks model, the new product lines are on track. They're still scaling up though, so it has had a little bit of a muting impact on the operating model and the returns. But as you could see, our margins in Q3 was 23.6%. The guidance implies 25%, so we're still very focused on the 30% target. And as we continue to gain share and grow the top line, we're going to be on our way towards that number again. So some of it is the impact of getting the acquisitions up to scale, and that's the top line growth.", "Operator", ".", "We will go next to Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give a -- could you give us an idea of how far we are, in your opinion, into the LTE upgrade cycle right now? And if you could maybe give us an idea of how you feel positioned in LTE for the second half and maybe what percentage of it is contributing to the mix.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Alex. This is Liam. Well, I think overall in the industry, we're very early innings with respect to LTE. We have a very powerful LTE platform in a number of different devices including multimode devices that address the LTE standard. We do see, however, the design win traction going forward and our ability to gain share in LTE to be very bullish. And if you look at the platforms that we've addressed over the last 6 months and platforms that we're going to be addressing now, we're very confident that LTE is going to play a major role in 2013 for us.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "As a follow-up, I was wondering and you might not have all the details because their call is going on concurrently, but Qualcomm guided units down fairly significantly sequentially for the September quarter. How was your exposure there? And how does that fit in with your guidance for the September -- September quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure, Alex. Well, our attach rate with Qualcomm is quite high, and so we see the same or similar dynamics obviously that they would in those segments of the market. If you look at our guidance, what's really driving it are very specific programs that are ramping into production, as well as some of these devices that are continuing to ramp. They're relatively early in that ramp. So there really may -- there are some very specific Skyworks reasons why we may be bucking some of the normal market trends as we go into the second half.", "Operator", ".", "We'll go next to Parag Agarwal with UBS.", "Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "This is Steven Chin calling on behalf of Parag. Just a throw down on that previous question regarding some of the exposure that you have in platforms where Qualcomm is as well. Can you discuss in terms of your component content introduced that you may be seeing, any kind of rough numbers you can speak to in terms of rough percentage of the bandwidth you have out there where you're seeing content grow? Or is it a mix shift to higher LTE content perhaps that's helping you to see your revenues grow in the -- grow sequentially as opposed to some of the unit-related headwinds that Qualcomm may be seeing?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I think it's difficult to be -- it's hard for me right now to be terribly precise. I will say that the -- if you look at those Teardown reports, we are seeing, for example, the Samsung Galaxy Teardown reports that recently came out. I don't have the [indiscernible] 6 parts of Skyworks, 7 parts. So it had a pretty broad suite of Skyworks products. So what was -- the dynamic, it kind of goes like this. Smartphones continue to displace 2G devices. So we see that little bit of a wind at our back as we always get more dollar content for the traditional products in smartphones and tablets than we did in 2G. Our attach rate continues to improve starting with our top customers where we start to put more of those new products bolted around the existing products. That's growing.  And then we have been gaining quite a bit of leverage and traction from things like home automation, where we're putting our Wi-Fi devices in gaming consoles, or we're putting them in various applications and appliances around the home. So that's an example where those markets really were nascent a couple of years ago. They continue to grow, and I think they're really beginning to explode in the early innings, frankly.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Right. And if you look at the smartphone, as Dave articulated, you've got the core RF TAM increasing by virtue of multiple bands. But now that'd there be more explicit. We have wireless LAN devices both 2-, 4- and 5-gig. We have powered management, backlighting, DC-DC converters. We have Antenna Switch Modules. We have GPS. The last set of products I mentioned were really not in play for us over the last 2 years. They're new products. Some of those were organic, some came by virtue of deals, but they're absolute drivers now going forward.", "Steven Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And just a -- follow-up question is on some of the new products that you highlighted in the prepared remarks, products such as the Antenna Switch Modules, the GPS LNA and also the SkyOne products. Can you give us a little color on the sort of design time for those new products? Like is it comparable to your existing RF components? Or is it a longer or shorter lead time? And what's the sort of revenue ramp that you'd expect from the different product lines later this year or going to 2013?", "Donald W. Palette", "The SkyOne product is new. It's been in development for a couple of years, but the product has sampled, the feedback has been good and we expect lead customer production sometime later in this year. So there's no revenue contribution right now from the SkyOne products, but I will tell you there's a lot of development activity, and this truly is an unprecedented level of integration. And I don't know if you really listened to the comments when we described it or looked at the press release. It has all the analog and RF functionality between the chipset, the radio, the RF, the antenna and back, filters, amplifier, switches, all of the shielding. So I this is a product that for those customers who really want to have a world phone but looking for ease-of-integration, size, it has great current consumption, we think that's going to be a real winner for us, but it's brand new.", "David J. Aldrich", "Right. With respect to GPS and the ASM product, I mean, GPS location-based systems and services, you see now in every smartphone, every tablet, even in netbooks and notebooks. So we developed a cutting-edge product internally organically that we believe meets all the needs of leading tier ones. We're fortunate to have a suite of new design wins, and that's looking very good. And again, it's new business for us. The Antenna Switch Module really is built off of our core strength and RF switch. We have great in-house technology in pHEMT. We have SOI capability and then also some filtering capabilities in packages to bring that to bear to the market. So both of those of those products are a combination of organic work and then understanding what our customers need.", "Operator", "We have a question from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Dave, can you talk about your underlying assumption for market growth in September? It looks like -- I mean, 7% sequential growth into September is well below your historical averages. So I'm just trying to understand how bad of a scenario are you modeling from a market standpoint.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, there are a couple of things that I think is going on right now. We do see seasonal strength. We do see customers gearing up for that year-end push with products and, again, in the August, September, October timeframe. I do believe that there's been a bit of a mix shift away from the smartphone sales because there are different phone launches that kind of impact that and create some choppiness to the markets. So I would say in general, the September quarter is been a bit muted. We expect December to be strong. But I would say that, that's probably the biggest impact is simply some -- looking at the big -- looking at program launches and how that kind of changes that dynamic a bit, and it makes it hard to handicap normal seasonality.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Dave -- Don, I'm sorry, maybe can you talk about the customer concentration? I know you don't give the exact specific percentages of your largest 10% customers, but can you tell us in aggregate your top 3 customers account for what percent of your revenue this quarter and what was it last?", "Donald W. Palette", "Ittai, I will give you the top 10% customers this quarter. It was Foxconn and Samsung. Nokia dropped out of the top 10%, but they're still high-single digits, but we don't disclose anything besides that on a quarterly basis, so we don't aggregate that, give you a specific number.", "Operator", "We will go next to Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.", "Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "This is actually Matt Ramsay on for Mike. A couple of questions for me. I guess the first one is have you disclosed, or will you, the 2G to 3G to 4G mix of your wireless business in the quarter?", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure, Matt. It was roughly the same as it was last quarter, 20% 2G and 80% EDGE and WCDMA.", "Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, no one really brought it up yet, Don, but I wanted to dig into this $5 million -- $5.4 million credit that you guys got on the pro forma SG&A line around contingent liabilities for acquisitions. Maybe you could dig into a little bit more what that was around. And I guess maybe discuss what your pro forma numbers and results would've looked like absent that and discuss where it would have been relative to your guidance.", "Donald W. Palette", "As far as the $5 million, that $5 million relates to some M&A activity where we consummated some deals with earn-out potential for the people who own the company that we purchased. And that's just shoring up what that liability is going to be for us based on a 12-month period after the acquisition. So that's all it is. And as far as what the numbers would be, you just basically back that out of the numbers. I mean, it's a one-time adjustment.  It's related to  -- it was an earn-out related M&A activity. That's all it is. And just so you understand, you have to make an estimate upfront, and then you just shore it up at the end of the period. That's all.", "Matt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay, great. I think I understand the mechanics of it. But I mean, does it then imply that the numbers would've been a bit lighter on the earnings line than where maybe your guidance was before?", "Donald W. Palette", "No, absolutely not.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just maybe a little clarity on the guidance. If you could talk -- clearly doing better than the market. Talk about what the drivers there are. And then I think, Don, you mentioned that the linear and the RF business was roughly the same contributor in Q2. Do you expect that to continue into September?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, Blayne, I would say that the primary driver, our specific programs where we're beginning to ramp production and shipment of those sockets that are second half drivers for us. So that's it. Plus some of the organic and acquired product lines where the attach rate to our traditional OEM customers is getting higher. So as we're launching programs, we're launching them with more dollar content, not just LTE and traditional expansion of PA bands, but also the analog functionality that bolts around it in the system. So I would say that's probably the second largest driver. And I don't expect -- Don, maybe you could comment on this, but I don't expect the September to see any meaningful split -- difference in the split between our high-performance analog business and our mobile business.", "Donald W. Palette", "No, that's exactly where the forecast was. We don't expect any major change in that percentage.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then maybe just talk about the consolidations of some of these RF blocks. You highlighted SkyOne. You're also shipping a lot more multiband chips. You highlighted the GALAXY S III. Maybe address kind of where you see particularly the SkyOne fitting in the market. I mean, you say it will address all the bands. Is this kind of low end or across all spectrums of phones? And then would tier ones be using this? Or -- and then maybe just talk about how that places you versus the competitors? I mean, clearly, you're the only guys who introduced something now, but how do you see the competitive field?", "David J. Aldrich", "It's a big question. I would say that whether or not this hits the high end of the market really depends because when you -- the level of integration, to be clear, is we're taking all the bands -- all the popular bands -- of transmitting amplification, we're integrating the amplifiers with the switches using various process techniques. We're adding the duplexers as well as other filters. So it's fully shielded, so it truly is the, by far, by far the most highly integrated device in the world today. Now whether or not -- now inherent in that level of integration is a certain degree of inflexibility. The device is very small, but it is highly integrated. We've developed it as a platform strategy to allow us to reconfigure bands over time and to be able to address OEM customers as they look to either be perhaps more regionally based or add bands that others don't want to add. So we've anticipated that. That will determine in large part whether or not it's broadly applicable among the tier ones. There are different approaches with each different baseband partner, different approaches with the OEM, which will determine how broadly applicable it is. But there is a segment of the market, low end for sure, but I think maybe even some high-end sockets, where this is going to be an opportunity for a customer to get in the market quickly with a product that's fully shielded, where they can drop it in and run.  With respect to the competitive landscape, the problem for many of our competitors is that either they lack the system expertise because there's a lot of system integration thought that goes into how you architect a device like this. So it's difficult for component players. It's also difficult, if not impossible, if you're, for example, a filter company or a switch company or a PA company to be able to deal with this level of integration. So we think that, that kind of rules out some of the point product folks. And finally, the level of manufacturing and packaging integration is really unprecedented for this device. Remember, we are vertically integrated in packaging. That helps us both in the design time-to-market and the cost side. So the ability for us to make high margins on this product is really, we think, somewhat unique to Skyworks. You wouldn't want to source all these components and try to compete with us. So we think the competitive landscape is quite narrow.", "Operator", "We now have a question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "A couple of questions. You are a little bit weaker seasonally than we would've expected, which suggests maybe some more upside or shift towards the December period. Dave, how do you see that content would again be -- 35% linear? Or do you expect given some of your new acquisitions and maybe some new slots and the tablets or smartphones to favor more of the linear product once the ramps start picking up?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think December -- my expectation is the December quarter will be a strong quarter for smartphones, a seasonally strong quarter for smartphones. And within those -- within smartphones, we expect to not only see our traditional PA products, but some, as you mentioned, some of these other products. So there will be a lift to both our traditional PA business, as well as to some of these high performance analog products that are bolted around those PAs. So I still see that split being reasonably constant. Now it's quite -- it is possible you might see a slight shift towards the mobile devices just given there's more seasonality there, but I don't think it will move the dial much beyond that ratio.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "I mean, if we look at both sides in your ATI and we -- as separate for mobile products, and if we believe -- I mean you purchased them for a reason, and part of that would be the traction you can bring to bear with those companies into the smartphone world, one would almost expect to see kind of a shift, I won't say away, but a higher mix of those products than you've seen in the past, given you've acquired these guys since the first holiday season and you're truly running with them full bore. That doesn't sound like that's going to be the case though?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, you will see a higher -- certainly higher revenue for those products. I don't know that it's necessary a higher mix, see higher revenue in the traditional products. Don mentioned that we're 65-35. Not that long ago, we were 75-25 and prior...", "Liam K. Griffin", "And 80-20.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, not that long ago.", "David J. Aldrich", "So I think that's a relatively new phenomena that we're...", "Donald W. Palette", "So you're seeing some of that percentages already. I mean, that's the way to think about it.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Right. Exactly. And the other thing in here is that we are really expanding the design win footprint with those products. So I think you should expect as we go through 2013 to see more evidence of success with both the WLAN portfolio and power management. One of the things we do is certainly cross-sell inside of smartphones, but there's a lot of new markets that were entering by virtue of those products. We're getting into cloud-based sharing, we're getting into infrastructure spaces where we can put in DC-DC converters, and there's going to be collaborative plays where we use power management within our front-end modules to try to create differentiated architectures. So as we move forward, I think we'll continue to hear growth in both sides, but hopefully in some different applications.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Anthony Stoss with Craig Hallum.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Dave, can you -- are you comfortable with your production capabilities or capacity, both internally and externally later on this year and entering 2013? And also let me hear your thoughts on AC, when do you think it's really going to have a role to play in the handset marketplace.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I am comfortable with the capacity. And if you look at this quarter as an example, we spent, I think, just over $30 million against depreciation of $17 million, and that's all addressing any bottleneck that we may see for the second half ramp. So I do feel good about that. We made investments over the last 3 years, 2.5 years for sure, and the big-ticket items like bringing up more HBT capacity, going from 4 to 6 inches and so on. So there are no bricks and mortar requirements. So I feel quite good about not only our internal capacity, but what we've been able to do with our supplier partners to keep that hybrid model so we're able to offload some of that capacity to take some of the volatility out of the seasonality of the volatility. So I feel good about the supply side.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Right. And with respect to 11ac, I mean, we are right now building product, supporting routers and supporting kind of the first leg in the infrastructure for 802.11ac. Following that today, the handset applications, the smartphones that we're looking at, right now a high percentage of those are looking at 11ac attached. So starts with the routers, we're well positioned there. We have a great deal of content. As you know, it's multiple in, multiple out. You can have up to 8 streams in our router. We typically see 4 to 5, tremendous content. And then following that, we are starting to see leading OEMs now embed 11ac into their handsets.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. If I can sneak in one more quick question. Is there a -- can you just comment on the pricing environment if there's any considerable changes from last quarter?", "Donald W. Palette", "Anthony, this is Don. Nothing from last quarter. I mean, just a reminder, we're-- overall, our current erosion's within historical range. The only place that you might see -- we're seeing some slight change, that's the open 2G segment that's maybe increased slightly from what we'd experienced in prior years. But that's continues to be the only segment where pricing you have a chance to win business on price only. And the majority of our customers are making those decisions based on performance. And with us having the lowest cost structure in the industry, that allows us to continue to deliver strong margins. So we're really not seeing anything different than that, and we've articulated that the past several quarters.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Suji De Silva with ThinkEquity.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "So visibility, what kind of turns do you need for the quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "I'm sorry, Suji, could you...", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "How well booked are you to the guidance for the September quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "Typical for us. We've got between hub pulls and actual POs in hand, we're pretty much 100% booked, which is not unusual for us.", "Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And then for the China low-end smartphone market, I'm imagining that's a more competitive market from a price perspective. How do you expect to compete there? And do you consider that a significant opportunity for yourself?", "David J. Aldrich", "We do consider it a significant opportunity because we think that there is a great deal of pent-up demand. We think it's not only for the traditional chipset-enabled smaller local players, the indigenous OEMs. We also think that's an opportunity for the major international brands to really address that market using brand recognition and great products. So we think it's going to be a terrific market for us. There will be price pressure on those devices for sure, but we really compare it to what it's really -- what that customer will be upgrading from, which is a 2G device with less -- much less than $1.00 content. So it won't be the -- perhaps some of them won't be high-end world phones, but they will certainly have a great deal more content than a 2G product sold into that market. So we're -- and we're positioned with it with a number of products. We've got multi-converged devices or multimode devices that are low cost that will be tailored for that market. We have hybrid and high-performance devices as well. We've got a whole bunch of content that we're bolting around it in a way that we hope will facilitate ease of entry to market for some of these customers as well as increasing our dollar content. So I'm excited about the market, aware of the price pressures, but I think we're prepared to have a real strong play there.", "Operator", "We have a question from Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. Liam, just if I could, and I know Dave kind of addressed this a little bit, but I'm just -- I just want to make clear, you guys are winning PA market share now because of the additional solutions that you offer? Or is it the other way around that your PAs are simply better and you're just kind of bringing along all these other things like LNA drivers and LNA switches and other things like that at this point?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Well, I mean, I would say that the relationships that we've built over the duration of Skyworks since we started our company, the deep relationships with OEMs and also chipset providers, has put us in great position to win with power amplifiers and we've been doing that for a while. And then one inside the account collaboratively sell power management, WLAN, GPS, whatever is needed. So I think the leadership that we provided over the years in our power amplifier suite has really kind of paved the way for success in these other products. And we're doing a great job of satisfying customer needs and leveraging technologies in-house and through acquisition.", "David J. Aldrich", "The products have to be competitive. But it's clear that the credibility -- for example, when we acquired a couple of businesses, I think their biggest stumbling block was just having the credibility to sell into these huge companies and satisfy these big ramps. And our balance sheet is quite strong, our customers increasingly look for a profitable supplier partner with a good balance sheet, who can weather the storm. So we think that the viability that we have is critically important. So it's easy for us to get a product evaluated, but it has to be competitive.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Then can you guys give us an update on where you are now with the BAW filters?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sorry, where we are with BAW -- we don't make BAW filters. We source them, and we are in high-volume production in multiple sockets with PA, SAW and BAW devices, mostly SAW, frankly, because that's where the market demand is the highest and where the price is the lowest, or the price is most competitive, I should say. But we are in production with PA duplexers and multiple sockets in high-volume production, have been for sometime, and we're winning some sockets there as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dale Pfau with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Let's talk just a little bit more about the emerging markets and the trend from 2G to 3G. Could you talk about how that's affecting your share out there, what you're seeing the trends are? And then the other question I've got is what do you think your total attach rate and percentage of business is from laptop, I mean, tablets and notebooks are right now?", "David J. Aldrich", "We think the 2G market continues to not only decline in dollars but decline in units. So the market is becoming -- the 2G market is becoming a smaller percentage. And in fact, our 2G into the local China market, if you will or the open market, is probably in the order of magnitude of mid-single-digit percentage of revenue, so it's pretty small, Dale. Now we do sell more 2G products in that because we have big business with other customers who sell into that market or sell elsewhere. But -- so we're pretty convinced that the 2G market is going to remain in fairly steady decline. It won't go away, but in fairly steady decline.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Right. And with respect to tablets, Dale, I think we -- we're in very good position there. We have market share in tablets that's at least as good as what we have in smartphones on the RF amplifier side. But tablets is a great opportunity to leverage the highest performance wireless LAN mobile connectivity product. We're doing very well there. We're also bringing in switch and some of the other technologies that we mentioned. So we're very upbeat about the general market outlook for tablets. We think they're going to be rapidly adopted. We have high expectations going forward, and we expect to be a share leader.", "Operator", "And next, we have Jonathan Goldberg with Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan Goldberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to talk a little bit about -- I guess all that's left is the 2G feature phone market in China. That used to be a pretty big opportunity for you guys. It seems like you're still there, you're still active there. Is that true? Is that -- or should we just stop worrying about that market entirely?", "David J. Aldrich", "We're very active there. We've got a reasonably high market share, and it's been a good market for us, right. It's been kind of a workhorse market. It's been around for a long time. It is declining. It is -- if you think about that, the way we look at that market is a couple of different ways. We do have -- believe we have the lowest cost structure. We address it with a combination of pure CMOS devices as well as very low-cost gallium arsenide devices, and we're sold with partners like MediaTek, for example. The issue with the market is it is declining. The consumers in those markets want smartphones or they want high-end feature phones, and that's just where it's headed. And we like that transition because, frankly, there are more margin dollars there, there are more dollars per phone, so we think that's going to be a growth driver. But we don't shy away from the 2G market. We expect there to be the most price pressure there because frankly, for companies who -- competitors who have been unable to kind of make the leap to multimode designs and now even more integrated devices we're talking about today, that's sort of one of the last frontiers to go at it, and you go at it with price as the primary weapon. So we do see ASP pressure there. But we make money there, and we're going to continue to ride it.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, and alongside that, as we start to see the 2G market in China trade down, and as you know, that was a market that was less than $1.00 per SKU for us in terms of content, you're seeing local players like ZTE and Huawei really deliver low-end smartphones, in some cases high-end smartphones. We're seeing data cards where you have a couple of bands of WCDMA with GSM. So there's an active market there. And as Dave indicated, there's an appetite for global brands. And I think we're well positioned with some of the premier smartphones globally, and those products will eventually be big drivers in China.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Dave, I wanted to follow-up on the SkyOne product. You talked about sort of data more mainstream smartphone product. But wondering if you could talk from the baseband supplier perspective. Was this developed in conjunction with, a, your multiple baseband partners? Or do you anticipate this as really more a sale to sort of leading tier one or high-volume OEMs? And then I've got a quick follow-up on LTE.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, Quinn, I would say it was really to address a worldwide OEM market demand for ease of integration as the complexity increases. It really is a challenge with all those filters and all those PAs and switches and shielding it and coexistence or interference between, for example, Wi-Fi and 2-plus gigahertz cellular bands, so it's a real problem. And the more bands you layer in, the size constraint becomes an issue as well as just shielding it and handling all that RF complexity. So we really addressed it to try to figure out a way to make life easier for our customers. It won't be for all, and it wasn't geared towards any specific baseband. It was really more of a world product. It can be baseband independent. The interface was designed that way, so we weren't approaching it with any one specific platform in mind, although we have leading customers who have been sampled and who will be first to production with it.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then just quickly on LTE. You talked about LTE becoming obviously important in 2013. I think there's something like 10 to 14 different bands being used for LTE around the world. Any sort of sense you can give us as to how many bands on average you think you'll see in phones in 2013? I mean, it gets hard to imagine you're going to see full 10- to 14-band LTE phones plus 2G and 3G backward compatibility. So just trying to wonder, do you think it's on average 3 to 4, 4 to 6? Any thoughts you have on kind of the 2013 LTE devices?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I think it depends on the architecture. Some of the higher-end smartphones really will have, I mean, 8 devices or more. There are multiple bands of LTE. There's multiple bands of WCDMA. And then you have backward compatibility. So we have seen a trend at least today to drive as many bands the carriers will support, and we see those smartphones being designed today going into production next year.", "Donald W. Palette", "And we're using 2 approaches. One is were looking to continue to integrate at the die level these multimode designs and sweep in more bands and where performance demands it, we're having other -- using other manufacturing and packaging techniques to make it small and relatively low-cost. So that's where the kind of the system expertise of being able to play the ability to integrate upward within IC as well as in the package as well as in the MCM is an advantage for us. And that's where the customers are struggling as they -- LTE was in many ways the straw that broke the camel's back. Layering in those bands sort of made it impossible to go through a traditional discrete model.", "Operator", "We now have a question from Blaine Carroll with Avian Securities.", "Blaine R. Carroll - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I guess a couple of questions if I can. First of all, Dave, you talked about the 2G dollar being down, units being down. Don, did you give out the split of what the 2G versus 3G revenue was during the quarter?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, I did. It was roughly the same as last quarter. It was 20% 2G and 80% EDGE and WCDMA.", "David J. Aldrich", "But even within that -- even within that 2G, most of that is foreign brands sold into the China -- the open market 2G is somewhere below 10%.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes.", "Blaine R. Carroll - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Liam, when you think of those, the LTE bands are the popular right now, I'm assuming that it's 13, 17, maybe some activity up around 26 and 4, are there any other bands that we -- that are sort of bubbling up as far as LTE and LTE capabilities?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Well, there are a few that will go out further into 2014. But I think if you look at those 4 and then you go and look at typical WCDMA Band I, Band II, Band V, Band VIII. Okay, now you've got 8 bands and you add your GSM or your EDGE. So there you go. That's how you get your 8 or 9, and that is the type of architecture that we're seeing today. We're seeing that type of layout.", "Operator", "We have a question now from Tom Sepenzis with Northland Securities.", "Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division", "I'm just wondering if you could give us any kind of insight into the geographical strength or weaknesses that you're seeing.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I mean, it's actually tough because we don't really look at the business that way. I mean we have our key customers, and we do see regionally within the HPA space pretty good traction in the Americas and also in APAC.  The smartphones players are real global brands, and we look at our sales directly to those accounts and we really have to kind of follow the money where they sell.", "Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay, great. And in terms of the new markets like medical that you're targeting, are any of these -- I take it none of these are 10% of the business at this point, but are you targeting any of them to be in the next say 12 to 24 months?", "David J. Aldrich", "Tom, right now, no. The answer is that they're not 10%, but we have our eye on growing a lot of the key vertical markets that we're just seeing some traction in because they're accretive to the margin, the overall return of the business. So our goal will be to continue to grow those to a more meaningful revenue number for the company.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing remark.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Well, thank you, everyone for participating.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti ", "Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks fourth fiscal quarter 2012 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions. Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I would also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our  press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report a strong finish to our 2012 fiscal year with fourth quarter results exceeding our prior expectations. As we enter fiscal 2013, our market drivers remain strong and we're capturing more content than ever before within our existing mobile and diversified analog markets. On top of this, we are rapidly expanding our footprint in complementary new verticals like automotive, like medical and the connected home.", "Our competitive positioning continues to strengthen. With this design momentum and new product pipeline we have in place today, the stage set for us to outpace our addressable markets in 2013.", "Now turning to the fourth quarter results. We posted revenue of $421 million. That's up 8% sequentially and slightly above our previously updated guidance of $420 million. We produced fourth quarter operating income of $103.6 million with operating margins of 24.6% and that's up 100 basis points sequentially. We earned $0.53 in diluted earnings per share, and that's a $0.01 better than our updated guidance. And we're guiding to 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the December quarter with expanding margins.", "So it was another strong performance for Skyworks. For a more detailed commentary on the quarter, I'll turn it over to Don now for his financial review and outlook.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave and thanks again for joining us, everyone. I'll first provide a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2013.", "Revenue for the fourth quarter was $421 million, up more than 8% sequentially. Gross profit was $180.7 million or 42.9% of revenue. Operating expenses were $77.1 million, consisting of R&D expense of $49.2 million and SG&A expense of $27.9 million, yielding $103.6 million of operating income and a 24.6% operating margin. Our cash tax rate ended the year at 4.8%, down from 6.3% in 2011, primarily driven by our successful implementation of multiple business restructuring initiatives. And as a result, we paid no cash taxes in Q4 based on favorable year-end adjustments to our annual tax rate. Net income was $103.5 million or $0.53 of diluted earnings per share, $0.01 better than our updated guidance range.", "Now turning to our fourth quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We generated $50 million in cash flow from operations, bringing our fiscal 2012 total to $285 million. Exited the quarter with $307 million in cash and no debt. Invested $31 million in capital expenditures during the fourth quarter with depreciation of $17 million.", "Now for our first quarter 2013 business outlook. With our new platform wins and design momentum, we   expect Q1 revenue to be up 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Assuming a revenue level of $450 million, we suggest modeling gross margin to be up slightly to around 43%.", "Looking ahead, we see opportunity for further gross margin enhancement as we realize the benefits of our current capital investments and ramp up margin accretive products like SkyOne, SkyHi and our portfolio of a high-performance analog products. We expect fourth quarter operating expense to be approximately $80 million, resulting in operating margins just north of 25%.", "Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate of around 7.5%. We expect our cash tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2013 fiscal year, and that's better than our prior expectations of around 10%. As a result, we expect Q4 EPS at $0.54 using a base of 195 million shares. And as Dave will discuss, the drivers are in place today for Skyworks to outpace market growth, putting us on a path to achieving our midterm business model of 30% operating margins at quarterly revenue level of $550 million which, as a reminder, produces around $3.00 in annualized earnings per share.", "Now with that I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on our business drivers. Dave?", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Don. Now for the remainder of the call, I'd like to highlight 4 key elements of our strategy that underpin our growth and expectations. First, we are levered to high-growth markets. Second, we are broadly diversified across customers, product set and end markets. Third, our competitive differentiation provides a sustainable advantage in the market. And fourth, our unique business model enables us to efficiently convert strong top line growth into superior operating results.", "So starting with our market opportunities. We are fortunate to be a participant in many of the highest growth markets within the technology space today. By every measure, the mobile broadband phenomenon continues to advance on a global basis, slowly displacing traditional computing. Internet stalwarts like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, who historically have not participated in mobile devices, today see mobility as a critical component of their long-term strategies. This has spurred a race to provide the next generation of leading-edge smartphones and tablets as a gateway for eCommerce, for on-demand content, location-based advertising, mobile apps, cloud-based services and social networks.", "In emerging markets like China, the mobile broadband adoption rate is just beginning. Among China's top carriers, 3G still comprises less than 20% of the total subscriber base, creating a significant growth driver over the next 3 to 5 years as 2G subscribers upgrade. And in fact, a recent report from Barclays estimates that in China alone, 1.2 billion smartphones will be shipped throughout 2015. As a benchmark, around 300 million will be shipped throughout 2012.", "As this technology revolution is by no means limited to mobile, wireless connectivity is becoming pervasive throughout a growing array of applications in consumer products, machine-to-machine, home automation, even spanning automotive and medical applications. According to ABI Research, the number of Wi-Fi enabled devices shipped is expected to surpass 1.5 billion this year. This is more than twice the number shipped just 2 years ago.", "Second, we are broadly diversified, enabling stronger and more consistent financial results. Now as a reminder, there are 3 elements to our diversification strategy: diversification across our OEM customers, within our product offering and across a broad array of end markets. The result is that today, we are the supplier of choice with a leading share position at every mobile device OEM and baseband partner, helping to insulate us somewhat from customer share shifts.", "We address more RF and analog content today than ever before, beyond traditional power amplifiers and RF front ends into power management, Wi-Fi, GPS, switch modules, filters and tuners. We're addressing a broader set of end markets. Increasingly, we are seeing new opportunities in consumer products, home automation, automotive, medical and military.", "Third, complementing our diversification, we have well-defined and long-established competitive differentiators. We're experts in RF and analog system design, leveraging a global force of system and applications engineers. We offer an unmatched technology portfolio that includes deep expertise in SOI, CMOS, GaAs, BiFET and silicon germanium, along with a library of nearly 1,000 patents.", "We have leading capabilities in advanced integration, including proprietary shielding, 3D die stacking, flip chip and others. And we are the lowest cost producer based on our global scale and our integration capabilities.", "These differentiators allow us to produce the highest performing devices with the highest levels of integration. And SkyOne is a great example of this. Our customers are placing higher value on total solutions. And there's a clear premium placed on performance, supplier reliability and application support, which further reinforces our leadership position.", "And fourth, by leveraging these competitive advantages, along with our industry-leading scale, integration capabilities and hybrid manufacturing models, we've assembled an engine that efficiently converts above market growth into best-in-class returns. We are firmly committed to achieving our target operating model of 30%, which puts Skyworks among the top of the class within the semiconductor space. And we believe these 4 strategic pillars provide us with a clear competitive edge in the market.", "Now looking ahead to the year ahead -- now looking to a new year ahead, we have some very specific growth drivers in place that provide us a high level of confidence in our growth trajectory over the course of 2013.", "First, LTE. We're already engaged in developing activities supporting several major 2013 phone models that incorporate entirely new LTE bands like 9 and 10; 18, 19 and 38, 41, in support of deployments in Europe and Asia, resulting in more addressable content.", "Second growth driver are the emerging market smartphones. We have significant design momentum in leading smartphone reference designs within the China market, where we see our RF content opportunity more than doubling. On top of this, even the most basic smartphone provides new addressable analog opportunities that further expand our content. In total, it's not uncommon for us to be pursuing up to $3.00 or more in addressable RF and analog content in these applications.", "Third, is the growing adoption of tablets. The recent introduction of smaller screen sizes and lower price points is expected to dramatically increase adoption rates over the course of 2013. In fact, analyst forecasts predict that tablet shipments could reach more than 350 million units within the next 3 years. This market segment is clearly performance driven. And based on the strength of our technology offerings, Skyworks has established a leading share position with strong incumbency advantages.", "And finally, an explosion in mobile connectivity. Over the course of 2013, we expect to see a wave of 802.11ac enabled notebooks, tablets and smartphones enter the market with higher addressable dollar content for Skyworks. We already have significant traction in the 802.11ac market and have been designed into some of the first ultrabooks and smartphones to incorporate this technology.", "In total, as we look at the year ahead, we see these trends providing a mid-teens TAM growth opportunity, representing a powerful tailwind for Skyworks.", "So in closing, our fourth fiscal quarter marked another strong performance for Skyworks. And we're very optimistic about our prospects for 2013. We believe that our strategy of continuing to diversify our business, expanding into new verticals and maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working.", "This concludes our prepared comments. Operator, let's open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Craig Ellis representing Caris & Company.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Brett Perry here for Craig. Could you just give some granularity on the segments in the quarter and the outlook between cellular and linear products where the growth was coming from?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, the actual revenue breakdown, Brett, for the quarter was 40% high performance analog and 60% handsets, smartphones.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think from a segment standpoint, from a market standpoint, we expect strong growth in smartphones and tablets. We also expect strong growth in mobile connectivity. And we expect to see some ongoing softness in areas like smart energy and infrastructure.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, thanks. And then on your intermediate term financial model, what's your confidence in reaching that in 4 to 6 quarters? And I guess, given that the revenue target on that is 20% above current levels, is that really needed to hit your 30% operating margin? Just maybe some gives and takes within the model.", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure. I mean, well first of all, I think you have to look back to the track record. At various points in the last 3 or 4 years, we put together mid-term models and we've had a very high success rate at hitting those every time and, if you think about that 550, it is about 22% growth. But if you look at what we've been talking about, as far as the market opportunity, without even gaining any share, we see 2013 as a 15% kind of growth opportunity. So that kind of hangs with the 4 to 6 quarters that we've talked about. So we clearly see that opportunity in that 6-quarter horizon, within that horizon. And the volume is critical to hitting the 30%. You do need revenue level to leverage the OpEx as well as to continue to enhance and generate margin improvements. So you do need that kind of level to hit the 30%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the lines of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Dave, just a little bit of -- clarifying that, just for Q4, do you expect stronger mix of smartphones? Can you maybe just a bit on the macro environment?  Certainly looks like on some high-volume smartphones you had strong content share, so can you maybe discuss if you might be losing short-term share in other customers or if it's still the macro backdrop has different customers struggling?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure. Okay. First, we're quite pleased with our second-half performance. If you look -- include  our guidance, that puts us up about 15% in the second half versus the first half. So we're pleased with that, that's higher than the growth rate of the market. We are a very broadly diversified supplier. We ship to everyone. Therefore we are a bit of a proxy. And we continue to take share among the leaders while diversifying. So we're growing faster than the market. And I think that our sequential guidance this quarter being up 7% in the market, it's probably up in the mid-single digits range, is consistent with that.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay, thanks. And Don, can you just share with us, the 10% customers in the quarter, and the 2G and 3G mix within the wireless?", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure, Mike. The 10% for the quarter were Foxconn, Samsung. And 2G was roughly 20% of the revenue for the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Aalok Shah with D.A. Davidson.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. In terms of the pricing environment, is there anything we should make note of as to what might be going on in, particularly, in the smartphones space this quarter and maybe next quarter?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, Aalok. This is Liam. We certainly see some pricing activity, some pressure in some of the lower end markets, the 2G markets in China. In the smartphone space, however, we see this market driven by performance and value, and our technology there has led us to a number of new design wins and that's given us pretty defensible position with respect to pricing.", "Donald W. Palette", "And Aalok, just like to add to that, if you look at our historical ASP erosion, and we do it part by part, year-over-year. I mean, it's a metric that we look at very closely. We are well within the historical ranges. We see a little bit of a bump in the open market 2G pricing maybe a little higher discounting than we see in the past, but other than that, it's right within historical ranges for the rest of the portfolio.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And, Liam, in terms of kind of how you see the next few quarters, I guess this question's more meant you, you had a good ramp with Samsung on their flagship platform. Are you guys seeing some softness maybe at that customer, maybe going into this quarter? Or is there anything else we can make note of as to how you're progressing with that customer in the near-term?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. What I can tell you, in general, that with the leading smartphone accounts, one of the things that we're quite pleased about, and Dave alluded to this is that we are -- we're gaining additional content here. We're gaining share but we are also adding new products to our mix. For example, I think, when you look out over the next several quarters, you'll start to see an increasing attachment with embedded Wi-Fi devices from Skyworks, 2GB, 4GB and 5GB, oftentimes 11ac. And we're one of the first to market with that technology. You going to see an increasing attachment with the GPS LNA suite of highly customized devices, higher margin, very high performance. You're starting to see antenna switch modules now become part of our story. So those are some of the themes here, as well as power management by the way, not only camera flash but also RF power when we move into voltage regulators and soon, DC to DC converters. So there's really a real upswing here in new products that we're bringing to market that complement our existing high share position in front-end solutions.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to the line of Tavis McCourt representing Raymond James.", "Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk about kind of the flexibility in the operating plan if, for some reason, economic conditions or something else happens that makes that 15% TAM growth increasingly unlikely next year, how quickly can you kind of scale up or how much do you have to forward invest on the operating cost in a situation like that?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, the first we'll -- I think the first and most importantly talk about the hybrid manufacturing model, I mean, we -- I think we're extremely well positioned to handle any revenue volatility, whether it's upside or downside, with the combination of internal sourcing and external sourcing, so from a margin standpoint, we think that positions us for best-in-class margins regardless of what happens to the top line. So that's very positive. And from an operating expense standpoint, I mean, we have some flexibility. There's variable costs on the line. But at $80 million, we think we are sized appropriately. And we wouldn't expect to change that dramatically. But I do think from the margin standpoint, we will produce the best results, given any revenue condition.", "Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And then a follow-up on the balance sheet. How much of that cash is in the U.S. and unencumbered? And as we get close to the cash levels you were before the acquisitions just a couple quarters, how should we think about cash...", "Donald W. Palette", "The lion's share, that's in the U.S. It's probably 80% -- at 85%. And the amounts that aren't onshore can be invested in some investments we're making in some of the new business structures, so it can be utilized very effectively.", "Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And in terms of cash usage, as we watch the cash grow now back to pre-acquisition levels?", "Donald W. Palette", "It's the same for us at all times. We're interested in using the cash as a competitive weapon and to generate shareholder value. So we're going to continue to look at the right M&A opportunities, where we can grow and accrete not only EPS but operating margin. We'd look at share buybacks at times. And so anything that we believe is going to add shareholder value would be a possibility for the company.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to drill into the OpEx, just wanted to understand why it is that you're guiding to such a significant quarter-over-quarter increase in OpEx?", "Donald W. Palette", "It's really when you look at where we ended up, Ittai, for Q4, the $77 million, we're guiding up to $80 million, and it's really there's some targeted headcount adds that we're doing both from an R&D and field application support standpoint. And we've got some variable R&D expenses that are tied to key programs. All these investments if -- we're very confident shareholders are going to be pleased because we see some significant return opportunities down the road for these investments.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Can you be then a little bit more maybe forward-looking in commenting on how should we think about OpEx growing from that December quarter level moving forward? I mean, is this a one-time kind of jump up and then it lands up somewhat?", "Donald W. Palette", "I wouldn't be expecting it to go from 80 back down the 77. That isn't that -- I don't think that's what you should...", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "No, can it stay flat? Or I mean, I'm just trying to -- it really seems unusual and I look at your increase last year also, and last year your OpEx was flat moving from September to December. So there wasn't anything seasonal to it. I'm just trying to understand again how do I get my hands around this?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, yes. Exactly, exactly. My comments weren't seasonal at all. Hopefully that didn't confuse you about what I said. I was talking about program investments, they weren't seasonal at all. But yes, you can expect the 80 to be flat certainly into -- through the March quarter. We have pay raises midyear that start June 1 so that there's a -- there can be a slight increase with that. So there will be some increases beyond that. But they are really immaterial in the scope of things when you look at the amount we are investing.", "David J. Aldrich", "I think this is, Ittai, that these were variable expenses more than anything else. So we have a high masked charge, for example, this quarter, as we are ramping and transferring a lot of designs into production. So it's pretty simple. It's as simple as that.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But this still leaves you comfortable that, with this increase, you can reach that 30% operating margin target at that specific revenue level?", "Donald W. Palette", "Absolutely. Because again, we're going get there as a two-pronged approach, as we always do. So our goal is both margin expansion and leveraging at 550, whether the OpEx is $81 million, $81.5 million a quarter. That's well within the range of what we can do to deliver the 30%. So yes, we are totally confident in that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Don, I just wanted to follow up with the mix of your business between RF and analog. I thought you said the mix was 60 40. Last quarter was 65 35. I know it's not perfect math but obviously, there's some rounding in there, but it would suggest the RF business really didn't grow quarter to quarter, if you get the math to work. I'm just wondering if you could give any clarity as to if that's the right math? And then conversely, what's driving the growth in analog?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, Blayne, just to clarify, we're 40% high performance analog this quarter and 60% handset. And last quarter, 65% handset and 40% -- or 35% high performance analog. Correct? I just want to make sure your comments were tied...", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. Then the mix of handsets just declined but yet your revenue went up. So I'm just trying to understand the moving pieces. It would suggest the handset portion hasn't grown that much but yet the analog portion is.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, we have seen some improvement growth on the high performance analog piece. Again, you have to take into account that we have some acquisitions that have come in, that we've been able to lever up with share gains. We've been able to take, for example, a high performing WiLAN portfolio and drive it into numerous customers. Not only handsets but also routers, we're enjoying an 11ac ramp, the GPS technology is launching and looking very strong for us. And then if you look at some of our antenna switch products and advanced antenna tuning products, we are starting to see some momentum there. So we've had benefits as well on the high performance analog side. That have -- that propelled the growth here in the last quarter.", "Donald W. Palette", "If you look at the Teardown and think of it this way, if you look at the Teardown reports and these numbers, 35% to 40%, we're kind of rounding a little bit, it's a little bit less than 5% sequentially, but be that -- but having said that, if you look at the Teardown reports and then listen to our commentary, we're seeing a lot of smartphone growth, for example in GPS LNA power management devices, camera flash drivers, antenna switch modules and Wi-Fi devices versus a traditional PA. So when you look at those products as being non PA-based or high performance analog, that explains parts of it. So think of it in those terms. Where we got your PA business, it'd be up slightly and bolt-on products that are up more dramatically because those are new growth drivers for the company.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "As your volume increases, anything you can do on the materials cost side to try and get better pricing from your suppliers? Also, as you're launching new GPS technology and Wi-Fi in the AC side, is that accretive to gross margins? I'd love to hear kind of your view on those 2 pieces and SkyOne ramp and [indiscernible].", "Donald W. Palette", "Anthony, as far as how we manage our supply base and we absolutely -- I think we're do an excellent job, we have very specific targets year-over-year as far as driving material content out and volume certainly helps with those discussions. But that's something we talk about and execute on every day. So that's clearly part of our ability to expand margins on a go forward basis and has been part of it for the last 3 to 5 years.", "David J. Aldrich", "I think as you look forward to 2013, the products that you are seeing in the most recent Teardown reports and that we have been highlighting on this call are on balance and, on average, accretive to our company gross margin. That includes SkyHi, it includes SkyOne, it includes Wi-Fi and GPS. Those products are all accretive to our averages. They're relatively new to us and they're ramping now. So as we look at the mix of products moving away from to 2G, more commoditized segments and towards more highly integrated products at which SkyOne is probably the most dramatic example, those products are indeed accretive. And you'll see those playing out through 2013 in improving margins.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Thanks. A couple questions here. It's clear that your analog products are starting to grow here and I guess that's where some of your balance shift towards HPA has been on the quarter. How much of that are your acquiring to hit your target market? Sounds like it's going to be a big growth area for 2013 especially since these new acquisitions, you're leveraging the share gains. So is that a big component, Don, of the target market? And then I know SkyHi was introduced last year, I think it's sampling, now, when is it likely -- are we likely to see that in a Teardown of a production phone? Is it -- are you targeting first half of next year, late next year? Any idea at all?", "Donald W. Palette", "So Ed, just to clarify your first question, you meant for the target model? You said, market. You mean, model, right?", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Yes, exactly.", "Donald W. Palette", "And in order to achieve that 30% we are not assuming a big shift in the HPA handset percentage at this point in time. So if that 60 40 goes more towards high performance analog, that's a positive. That actually accelerates margin accretion. But we are not expecting a big movement from that in the model estimate.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I'm not sure I understand you, did you mean SkyOne? When did we see SkyOne, you said SkyHi.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", ".", "Yes, I meant, SkyOne.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay, just because SkyHi is in production now. SkyOne, we have sampled to multiple customers. We have a lead customer who's putting it through its paces now with an expectation that very early in 2013, you'll be able to buy by a phone with SkyOne incorporated. And just to remind the listeners, SkyOne is a complete multimode PA addressing both 3G and LTE bands. It has all the duplex filtering, all the switching logic and control to extend from the output of the transceiver chipset, right to the antenna and back. It is the most highly integrated product in the market, in the world. In fact, in RF front end and it's accretive to our margins.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the lines of the Vivek Arya from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm curious, if your analog products are growing faster than some of the handset parts, why are gross margins under some pressure? Is it because of more outsourced parts or is it just that some of these new analog parts are going into a handset also? And if also, the same time, if you could comment on Q1 gross margin outlook, I think the fall through appears to be about 39% or so, which is below your 50% target. So if you could just address the Q4 and Q1 gross margins there, the moving pieces in that.", "David J. Aldrich", "This is Dave, I'll take the first part of that. First, the smartphone and these higher level mobile devices incorporate both our FVS [ph] products as well as the suite of HPA products. So again, the GPS LNAs, the mobile connectivities, the high throw count switches, the power management devices, LED products, they're high performance analog. So it is a mix.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes and as far as the question on the margin, yes, you're right. We've historically -- as we've been generating margin expansion, we've been dropping through in the high 40s. And just to remind everybody when we had our Analyst day, we talked about that going into 2013, when we had recommended modeling 45% to 46% kind of drop going -- and it's really -- in the guidance that we just gave on the 450, the 43% off of what we produced in the fourth quarter is a little over 44% drop. So it's pretty consistent with what we said. And the reason for that is, that we talked about, it's a higher mix of outsourced material with volumes ramping. We've made some CapEx investments, it takes 2 or 3 quarters, we're working through the payback on that. So some of that benefit isn't yet in the numbers. Some of the higher margin segments as we talked about on Analyst day, like infrastructure, still a little sluggish. And we had a little higher in Q4 and Q1, a little higher 2G mix which is, again, has had the most ASP compression, a little bit lower margin. So those are really the reasons. But again for modeling purposes, we would recommend using 45% to 46% going through the balance of the year, as far as contribution.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Alex Gauna from JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I know you don't guide 2 quarters out, but I was wondering if you could give us an idea of what you would consider normal seasonality in this environment? And based on your visibility, if you think you can better than normal seasonality in the March quarter and maybe some of the puts and takes on that.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, thank you. It's a little too early to tell what margin is going to shape up to be. It depends somewhat on holiday season sell-through. I think it's -- given our design status and recent wins, we do expect to outperform whatever the market may be. But honestly, I think we need to see a little bit more the December quarter as we move through October into November, December.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Fair enough. And I was wondering, you mentioned some of the opportunities, I think your content doubling in some of your China opportunities. Can you talk about what percentage contribution you think as an end market China is for you today and maybe some insights into your optimism around that?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, the end -- the 2G end market China business is mid-single digits as a percentage of revenue. And that's really defined as kind of the indigenous local providers and the products we sell through the likes of MediaTek and others. That's about 5% or 6% of our revenue. And we step forward into 2013, that business kind of hit a trough of unit volume, where the decline in 2G was more than offsetting the uptake in 3G, TD and smartphones in general. We see the crossover point occurring about now certainly into early 2013, where the TAM will begin to expand again as the most heavily commoditized segment of the whole wireless business today is open market 2G China. I think that business gets smaller and smaller and will finally begin to see real increase in smartphone adoption rate in China. So we think China is a great story in 2013 and '14. It hasn't been a great story in the late 2011 and 2012.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Right. And Alex, this is Liam. As a follow up to that, I think, you're going to see China being a gross margin mover for us, whereas the 2G business today is the lion's share, you're going to see more customized infrastructure solutions to lever to ZTE and Huawei. We're actually starting to deliver some of the Wi-Fi technology that we mentioned to companies like HTC and also Huawei. So I think you're going to see a mixed benefit as well as revenue move in 2013.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, one other thing. It's probably an early indicator is when we're competing now for design win sockets on reference designs, for example, for 3G and so on in that market. We're competing with highly specialized, customized designs for that chipset. In 2G, we're competing with several competitors, many of whom really had no choice but to compete on the basis of price. We do not see that model replicating in the 3G smartphone space. So not only will there be increased content, the products will be far more complex. There'll be more bolt-on capability because there'll be higher Wi-Fi attach rate, there'll be GPS, there'll be other products, there'll be more complex power management needs. We can address those. So it's really -- it's a double whammy. We get the growth in unit volume with higher dollar content driven by complexity and we get to bolt-on a lot of new HPA products as a result of the very nature of those products being more smart than 2G voice only.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Dale Pfau from Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Dave, may we talk a little bit about connectivity? I know in that's in HPA, are you seeing that grow faster than your overall sort of 15%, 14%-15% year-over-year growth? And can you talk about -- a little bit about how you are seeing that not only in the December quarter but could we see an acceleration of that in the first calendar quarter?", "Liam K. Griffin", "This is Liam. That is certainly one of the fastest-growing portfolios for us, the whole 802.11 suite. We have 11ac now as the leading driver for growth, but we also have sustainable gains even in 11n. So one of the themes here is just really the attachment into smartphones and tablets, which is relatively new. We see an increased content and margin pop as we move to 11ac, and we are also seeing some of these advanced routers, we referenced a few in our business highlights with NetGear, where the addressable device content for us is 15 to 20 units with MIMO technology, multiple in/multiple out data streams. So that is really an important driver for us. We see that really in it's early innings now. We think 2013 is going to be a big move but we're also going to see more devices be attached 2014, 2015. So we think it's sustainable. We're in the right place right now. Our share position is outstanding but there's many, many accounts that haven't yet turned on the 11ac pump here so there's lots more ahead.", "Operator", "We go to the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just a housekeeping question first. When you look at your antenna tuning and antenna switch products, you guys put that in analog, right? So when people look at analog growing it's probably some of these products going to handset that are growing also, right?", "David J. Aldrich", "That's correct. I think it may be useful to think of FVS [ph] as front-end solution, which would be power amplifiers, power amplifier duplexers, multimode PAs and the balance of the products that bolt around those on the analog side, being high performance analog.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Now when you look at the December quarter, when you look at the handset overall versus, let's say, core analog only, obviously, analog markets now seem to be [ph] weaker into December. Have you seen -- when you look at that December, again, are you seeing [ph] weakness on analog offset by a little bit stronger -- the handset side growing better? Is that how you look at it?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, but let me clarify. Yes, the short answer is yes. We're seeing smartphones, very strong. We are seeing tablets, very strong. We are seeing mobile connectivity, Wi-Fi, very strong. 11ac routers initial ramp plus a lot of home connectivity devices, Wi-Fi devices, attach rates into tablets and the like. So we're seeing those markets very, very strong. We are seeing kind of the broad catalog of analog products not being so great, flattish. Infrastructure remains stubbornly flat. I think that finally starts to see some growth, or our customers are finally beginning to show growth in infrastructure and smart energy, would be, I guess, the third that's showing just flatline here in December. And it is important for us to see that infrastructure -- we are seeing signs of growth in infrastructure, that there clearly isn't enough capacity. Our customers in that space have held off as much as they can, but those products are very accretive to our gross margin. So we really want to see 2G decline, smartphones increase and then a return to growth in the core analog business. We expect to see that in '13, but we don't expect to see it in December.", "Operator", "Then with the line of Quinn Bolton representing and Needham and Company.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Dave, just wanted to follow up on that question about the China business you'd referenced in your script, multiple baseband references and targeting the emerging markets, 3G handsets. Can you expand a little bit about that position? And a sort of follow on question, I think you said that 2G was still the dominant mix of your China business. Yes, when do you think you'll see that 3G crossing over the 2G? Is that first half of next year? Is that later in 2013?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think we see it this year, in the first half of 2013. We're finally starting to see a balancing in that portfolio where the decline in 2G is no longer resulting in a net decline in that business. And we when talk about baseband partnership, it's clearly MediaTek, but we're also lined out very nicely with the chipset providers into Huawei and ZTE and the other foreign OEMs. So we look at Qualcomm, MediaTek and others as being our reference design partners.", "Liam K. Griffin", "And let me add to that. One of the unique benefits that we bring to the China accounts as they ramp up into 3G and LTE is our architectural experience, our systems knowledge, our application support. It's really critical now as these customers and the OEMs move up in complexity. These are not easy products. I think the Skyworks team is doing a great job of really not only providing product but the architectures and the systems know-how to turn these customers on.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Can I, just a quick follow on that. Do you include the Huawei and ZTE sort of branded OEM accounts in China in that bucket that you discussed? Or would you exclude those branded OEMs and really just looking at the white box?", "Liam K. Griffin", "No, we include them, but one point to make, is that the revenue -- the 2G revenue has largely been smaller OEMs. There's Huawei and ZTE but it hasn't been -- the 3G opportunity is going to be much more Huawei and ZTE than it will be some of the smaller white box players.", "David J. Aldrich", "I think those folks didn't play very big in 2G. They really kind of cut their teeth in data cards and they were 3G enabled or EDGE enabled. And so we do include them and we have a very high growth expectations for them. We did not have a high growth in the 2G space for those customers. They really were indigenous, smaller companies supported by local reference designs.", "Operator", "And will go to line of James Faucette representing Pacific Crest.", "James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions for me. Wanted to once again touch on China and the opportunity for dollar content growth there. As you look at that opportunity, how much do you assign to the ability to capture dollar content from others with your newer products and more complete products, versus how much are you looking at as being an actual step up in the overall RF content within those new phones?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, let me take a stab at that first. One, we do expect to have disproportionately more share as this market converts to 3G and to smartphones because it's where technology differentiates, where the challenges are the greatest. So as there are more brands, as there are more needs for filtering and switching and control, we'll gain more traditional front-end content in that segment than in the 2G where we have a strong product portfolio but frankly the margins are dilutive and there's quite a bit of competition. We do not see that in this space. So that's one element of it. The second area is that we will grow dollar content and grow share in that sort of traditional front-end solution within that market. But we will also see a higher attach rate with GPS, with Wi-Fi and more complex power management needs as an example. More complex switching and ASM requirement simply by virtue of the number of bands and what those phones are going to be required to do. So we'll have a lot more HPA content bolted around that front end, in 3G, where we have, frankly, very little in 2G. There wasn't much we could do in 2G beyond the front end.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Cody Acree with Williams Financial.", "Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "If we think about Samsung for a second, I know Samsung usually does kind of an end of year inventory clean up and then there's a myriad of things that you're designed into, do you expect Samsung to grow for you in the December quarter?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Actually, that's a good -- that's a good question. And right now, our view for Samsung is it's probably flat into the December quarter right now.", "Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "And I guess could you give me a little bit of color on to how -- is it inventory? Is it specific programs? I guess why the flatness, given Samsung's growth?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think -- I would at it this way, Cody. It's a great question. We see an OEM shipped in the December quarter where you have a couple of products that are selling so well that other customers will tend to see -- other OEM customers will tend to see less strength in the December quarter. So you do see an offset. And we see that with Samsung and others. However, when I get into the March quarter, there are some new products that have been announced to be released and our content there is very high. And we have really high expectations for those products. So we're very excited about Samsung moving into 2013. But I think you have to realistically expect that when you have a big ramp going on in the December quarter that other OEM customers won't do as well.", "Operator", "And will go to the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital markets.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Sounds like you're still pretty committed to the 2, 2.5G China open market while 3G grows. So perhaps you can explain if there's scenarios where that gets more benign? I know you got CMOS PAs, there were a lot of startup CMOS PAs in that market, vendors. Or perhaps as a larger vendor, you're better able to fill some [indiscernible] patterns.", "David J. Aldrich", "I'm sorry, is the question related to supply? Or just how we're playing that market in terms of...", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Just how you -- you sound committed to that market still so how are you going to play that market and...", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Well, the 2G market is in steep decline in China. Our position there has remained 40%-ish, we think. Hard to -- I say we think because it's hard to calculate. There is a big sort of gray market, if you will. It's hard to really quantify but we sell a lot of product. And so, near as we can tell, we're about 40% share, maybe it's slightly, may be a couple points less than that. We're committed to the extent that we have products, we have a very low cost structure. We have a tiered structure of products, everything from low-cost, relatively low performance CMOS designs to low-cost higher performance GaAs-based designs as well as front-end solutions that are very high performance, and the price changes accordingly. So we are committed to it. It is, however, dilutive. It is where ASP decline has been the most intense because it is by far the most commoditized section of our business. So I'm not disappointed to see that it is getting smaller. And while we are committed to it, we're also delighted that there'll be an upgrade cycle because we're going to make a whole lot more money in China in the 2013 and 2014 than we did in '11 and '12.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And for a follow-up, I know it's early to talk about the impact of Hurricane Sandy but any impacts on internal and outsourced manufacturing? I think for RF, people source pHEMT and silicon and insulator wafers from Massachusetts and New York, any impacts on delivery of materials and cost of that delivery?", "Donald W. Palette", "No. No, not at all.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Yes, this is a quick follow. Dave, it sounds like -- I mean, you've done so well in the handset side of the business, it's your own show, you're kind of preeminent position in both iPhone and in Samsung, you've done well. And then I know that you got a good position in a lot of other OEMs even if they're shipping. Doesn't this speak to 2013 that more of your growth is going to have to come from the linear side of the business? And I don't necessarily mean organically. You have not been afraid of acquisitions in the past. Your cash probably will start to move up again. I know, having talked to everybody in the space, on the CEO [ph] side that everybody would like to do tuck-in acquisitions on the linear side. Can it reasonably expected that we could see Skyworks' mix, whether through growth, organically or acquisitions, to start moving more towards the linear side and mimic something more like an HPA company, TI or something like that?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think, Ed, we are committed to continuing to diversify, but that, by no means, implies -- I don't think you implied this, that we are backing away or shying away from the mobile sector. In fact, to the contrary, what we really expect -- I expect our mobile business to grow very strong in 2013. And there'll be components of traditional products there, like front-end modules, we had a long discussion about China, we think we'll get more PA and front-end module dollar content. It will be equally as strong as we bolt more technology that we work very hard to address, that becomes this bundling in system level sell is becoming increasingly important because these products are quite problematic for most of our customers. So we can solve those problems for them and get paid for it. So yes, it will be -- it will be RF ES business, it will also be more analog and, as Don mentioned earlier, we're always looking for opportunities to expand into new verticals and add to our technology and our market footprint. We'll do more of that in '13.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "So if we just take, say, the non-wireless business off the table for a minute, just look at the core GaAs, AM [ph], filter, switch-type business, is it fair to assume that more of your growth is going to come -- not come from that? You got great share everywhere but to increase content it almost seems like you'd have to branch off into power control and a number of the things that you got through ATI and like SiGe, for example, SiGe, the entire group is in your HPA side of the business today, correct?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, well, yes. The TAM growth in the front-end will be double digits, we believe in 2013. So the core front-end business driven by the conversion of 2G to smartphone, the increase in content with LTE, the increased switching content, we expect that to go up maybe double the unit volume increase. So if volumes are up 7%, you would expect a 14% to 15%. We probably are adding more TAM, a bigger target to high performance analog products. So over time, I think you will see the business balance more between diversified analog and our traditional FVS [ph].", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, Ed, this is Liam. I think if you look at the  individual market opportunities between Wi-Fi, I mean, power management, which is a $5 billion market, GPS, ASM and some of the other organic products that we're developing, mixers, VCL synthesizers, INQ mods, that are traditionally non-cellular go into infrastructure. Those markets, in aggregate, present a very significant TAM for the HPA team. And we've gained a lot of share this year but there's a tremendous amount of room for us to grow in 2013 and 2014. We've seen great momentum in a few of these categories but infrastructure and some of these other markets, we're well-positioned. We get a little tailwind there and you're going to see some upside.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for closing comments.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Well, thank you, everyone for participating tonight and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' first fiscal quarter 2013 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich; Don Palette; and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions. Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release, and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings. I would also like to remind everyone that our results and guidance we will discuss today are from [ph] our non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Skyworks is off to a great start to fiscal 2013. Our strong first quarter performance and better-than-seasonal guidance again demonstrate how our diversification and expanding market opportunities enable us to consistently deliver superior financial results. At a high level, we're capitalizing on the proliferation of connectivity in all its forms across the diversified analog landscape. In fact, it's virtually impossible to find a segment today that is not incorporating some form of always-on access. And as the enabler of all things connected, Skyworks is benefiting from, and in some ways facilitating, this market transition.", "Today we bring to bear an entire portfolio of leading-edge technologies along with world-class system engineering capabilities to provide differentiated, performance-based solutions, spanning the entire diversified analog market. So as the world at large becomes increasingly more connected, we are uniquely positioned to lead this transition. And our strategy is paying off as reflected by the strength of our financial results and guidance. During the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $454 million. Now that's up more than 15% year-over-year. We achieved an operating margin of 25.3%. We posted [indiscernible] earnings per share and generated $148 million in cash flow from operations. [indiscernible] capital remained very strong at 21.4% [indiscernible]. In short, Q1 was an excellent quarter for us across all our key metrics.  And for our second fiscal quarter, we see continuing momentum as key program ramps and growth in new product categories helped to offset normal seasonality.", "The combination of mid-teens revenue growth and mid-20% operating margin that we've demonstrated thus far into Q -- into fiscal 2013 puts our financial returns among the best of breed in the semiconductor industry. With the opportunity pipeline and design win momentum we have in place today, the stage is set for continued revenue growth, continued margin expansion and earnings leverage for the remainder of 2013 and beyond.", "Now for a more in-depth review of our financial results, I'll turn the call over to Don for his outlook.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us, everyone, we appreciate that. Revenue for the first quarter was $453.7 million, up more than 15% versus the year-ago quarter and nearly 8% sequentially. Gross profit was $195 million or 43% of revenue, which is in line with our prior guidance. Operating expenses were $80.2 million, consisting of R&D expense of $50.7 million and SG&A expense of $29.5 million.", "We generated $114.8 million of operating income, yielding a 25.3% operating margin, which is a 70-basis-point increase over the prior quarter. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 7.3%, producing net income of $106.6 million or $0.55 of diluted earnings per share or $0.01 better than our guidance.", "Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $148 million in cash flow from operations; we invested $26.4 million in capital expenditures with the -- with depreciation of $18.5 million; and we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock, representing a $42 million investment. Given our confidence on our business outlook, we continue to believe that repurchasing shares of our common stock represents a highly attractive use of our cash. And finally, we exited the quarter with $378 million in cash and no debt.", "Now for our second quarter business outlook, with the order visibility and specific platform launches we have in place today, we expect Q2 revenue to be $420 million, representing better-than-normal seasonality and a 15% year-over-year growth. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 42.3% to 42.5%, with operating expenses of approximately $80 million.", "We continue to see opportunities for sustainable margin expansion in the second half and beyond as we leverage our current capital investments and benefit from the transition to a richer mix of margin-enhancing system solutions. Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 7%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2013 fiscal year. We expect share count to be around 193.5 million shares, resulting in second quarter EPS of $0.47.", "All of the underlying drivers are in place for Skyworks to continue to outperform, putting us on a clear path to achieving our mid-term business model of 30% operating margin which, as a remainder, generates around $3 in annualized earnings per share.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Don. For the remainder of the call, I'd like to provide some additional perspective on how we see the trend towards always-on connectivity transforming our analog markets. One of the overriding themes at this year's Consumer Electronics Show was the Internet of Things, which is comprised of sensors and embedded connectivity deployed across a seemingly endless range of devices that touch our everyday lives. We see this trend driving a proliferation of access points from conventional mobile devices, like smartphones, like tablets, to nontraditional devices like home appliances, medical devices, gaming consoles, industrial machinery, home entertainment systems, Smart Energy and security systems, just to name a few. Just compare the number of connected devices in your home today versus just a couple of years ago. The result may surprise you, and I can assure you that the list will only continue to grow over the next few years. In fact, some analysts are projecting over 50 billion connected devices within the next decade. This trend is happening today, and it represents the next major growth stage for the analog industry.", "Along with the explosion in access points, complexity is being driven substantially higher. Most network devices span a variety of communications protocols, including some mix of cellular, WiFi, Zigbee, peer-to-peer, Bluetooth, NFC on both licensed and unlicensed spectrum and across multiple operating frequencies. And the design challenges within this environment require competencies across mixed signal, analog and RF, including signal transmission and conditioning, seamless handoffs between disparate air interface technologies, power management, voltage regulation, battery charging, isolation, filtering and tuning, among others. And we have spent, at Skyworks, the last decade putting in place substantial differentiators to simplify these complex design challenges.", "Some examples: first, we are the experts in RF and analog system design, we're leveraging a global force of systems and applications engineers; second, we offer an unmatched technology portfolio that includes deep expertise in silicon on insulator or SOI, CMOS, gallium arsenide, BiFET, silicon germanium; and third, we have the leading capability in advanced multichip module integration; and finally, we are the low cost producer. By leveraging these core competencies along with the broad market footprint that we've created through our catalog business, we are rapidly transitioning our product mix towards integrated analog solutions and across diverse end markets.", "One interesting example of how this is playing out for us in real time is when -- is within the automotive market where we offer a portfolio of application-specific solutions that include GPS receiver modules, sensors, telematics, electronic transponders, diagnostics monitoring and collision avoidance. The automobile itself is transforming into a networked hub, incorporating in-dash infotainment consoles, navigation, real-time traffic and other demand-based services through a host of communications protocols. And looking ahead, we see substantial opportunity for continued growth as OEMs continue to increase functionality and therefore, analog complexity. And it's clear that these trends in the diversified analog market are moving in Skyworks' direction. As a solution provider with a broad technical footprint, our addressable analog opportunity is exploding. And as an enabler of all things connected, Skyworks is uniquely positioned as a direct beneficiary.", "We expect these positive underlying trends to fuel our TAM growth for years to come, and as our product highlights demonstrated, we're capitalizing today. In fact, during the quarter, we captured new design wins across a number of diverse applications that include Comcast's Xfinity home security and surveillance systems, high voltage protection circuits for Boston Scientific heart defibrillators, switch modules for in-dash automotive infotainment applications. Connectivity supporting -- connectivity ICs supporting Nest's energy-efficient intelligent thermostat, a 16-channel LED TV backlighting controller for LG and others, antenna-tuning and control module supporting multiple smartphone OEMs, connectivity solutions within several new set-top box designs across 3 leading OEMs, radiation -- and radiation-tolerant optocouplers supporting new iridium satellites.", "So in closing, we're quite optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2013 and beyond. Trends in the broader analog market are moving in our favor and our strategy of continuing to diversify and expand into new verticals, while maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working.", "Okay, that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] First question from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "First, just a clarification, what was the mix between handsets and non-handsets in this quarter and where do you expect that mix to be in the March quarter?", "Donald W. Palette", "The mix, Vivek, this is Don, this quarter was similar to the mix that we had last quarter. It was 60% -- approximately 60% handsets and 40% HPA. And as far as the March quarter, we don't guide that, but we wouldn't expect that number to change materially in that quarter.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And that's my question, Dave, you are guiding to better-than-seasonal trend. And I think you mentioned share gains in your prepared remarks. Can you give us any more color around that? Is it driven by share gains at one single customer's new model? Is it more broad based? Because we have heard a lot of weakness at one of your larger customers in the March quarter, but you are guiding to better-than-seasonal trends, so I'm trying to understand where that strength is coming from.", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure, Vivek, thank you. In fact, we see -- you're probably right, March normal seasonality is in the 10% to 12% range. We're going to do better than that. And as you mentioned, some of our customers are doing very well, others not so well. They're challenged. We are seeing new analog opportunities ramping, antenna switch modules, wireless LAN devices, some tuning products. We've also -- as we talked about in the prepared comments, we've expanded into some new verticals. We are seeing sequential growth there in some cases in a seasonally down quarter for mobile. So I think it's just a combination of those identified programs, as well as beginning to ramp into some of these new verticals.", "Operator", "A question from the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley& Co.", "Brett Piira", "This is Brett Piira here for Craig. I guess could you just talk a little bit about your 802.11ac design wins and then once in that, when do you see the ecosystem evolving into the smartphone, tablet, PC-type area? And do you still expect that to be meaningful in 2013?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Brett, this is Liam. 802.11ac is a major upgrade opportunity for the WiLAN ecosystem with Skyworks being a direct beneficiary. We are today closely aligned with the leading chipset providers, number one. We have design wins today and access points and routers that are shipping. We have new design wins that just occurred in the last quarter in notebooks and netbooks. And we see Q3, Q4 fiscal significant ramp in 802.11ac and handsets. So it's a story that is building momentum. And we think it's sustainable for a number of years.", "Brett Piira", "Okay. And then could you just provide me with your mix of 2G in the quarter?", "Donald W. Palette", "It was roughly 20% 2G and 80% EDGE and WEDGE.", "Operator", "And the next question from the line of Mike Walkley of Canaccord.", "Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "This is Matt Ramsey on the line today for Mike. Just a couple for me. I wondered if you -- this is kind of building on the last question. I wondered if you might break out your 4G mix in the quarter, just because now, I mean with the 2 big guys kind of ramping 4G phones globally, it seems like that's probably a material portion of sales, and you hadn't broken out before. So I was just wondering if you might today.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, our -- it's a little -- Matt, it's a little hard to answer that question specifically because as Don mentioned, it's about 80% 3G, 4G, 20% traditional feature phones and the like. And within those smartphones is a combination of 4G, 3G backward compatibility all the way to 2G. So it's difficult to break it out. But those products in smartphones for us are 3G and 4G PAs, increasingly WiFi enabled, the GPS and LNAs, the analog power management devices. So it's a pretty broad suite. And now antenna-tuning devices, and so on. So it's a pretty broad suite of analog products that make it up, of which 4G is an element. But it's hard to break it out specifically.", "Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay. That's fair. And then I guess as a follow-up and kind of unrelated, Apple talked recently about launching the iPhone LTE-enabled with 36 new carriers. From our work, it seems like LTE network rollouts outside of just the U.S., Korea, Japan are starting to pick up a little bit of steam. Maybe you could talk about what you're seeing on the wireless infrastructure front? Because I know that would be margin accretive for you guys. And anything that you're seeing different from the last several quarters where that market's been pretty weak?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure. Yes. The wireless infrastructure space, as we've discussed in the past, has always been a major opportunity for Skyworks, and it had been relatively sluggish through 2012. We are starting to see some design wins pick up and some demand pick up with customers like Ericsson, Huawei in Asia, Nokia-Siemens. So we have a great footprint there. We have a deep portfolio of analog mixed signal technologies and margins. And we agree, we think the LTE rollouts on handsets are going to be a catalyst for a major upgrade cycle.", "Operator", "And next question from the line of Parag Agarwal of Topeka Capital Markets.", "Parag Agarwal - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Don, first question is about gross margin. How should we expect the gross margin to trend as we go forward? And if you could highlight specific margin drivers that we should look for.", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure, Parag. I mean, it -- this is consistent with what -- when we talked about our goal of a 30% operating margin. The incremental revenue at this point -- what we recommend that you do is on a -- is to drop that through at about 46% to 47% incremental margin. And we've said our goal is to drive that back up into the high 40s or even 50. But at this point in time, the best way to model it for '13 is to use that 46% to 47%. And that improvement from the drop you've seen in the last few quarters, I mean that's really driven by a combination of things. It's more of a -- it's a mix shift from -- going from 2G lower margin products, where we're going more towards high-end smartphones. And also the contribution Liam talked about as far as the overall content we're getting from the non-PA part of the business. And those margins are all accretive to the overall Skyworks. So you get your mix shift towards more and more content that's outside the traditional PA space and it's also a movement away from 2G. Those things, coupled with the extra volume, are going to drive margin enhancement for us in the back half of the year.", "Parag Agarwal - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And, Dave, regarding the share gains, should we expect your share gains to accelerate as we head towards the end of the year, maybe driven by LTE and SkyOne and SkyHi? And also if you could talk about the traction you are seeing with SkyOne?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure. I think you should see more the -- the trend of high share for Skyworks in smartphones and tablets and related devices, but you should also see more content bolted around the traditional transmit products for us. So as you see from recent Teardown reports, we're finding increasingly that our customers are coming to Skyworks and they're looking for more of a complete-system approach. They're asking us to figure out how to shield the -- how to shield frequency interference or coexistence issues, they're asking us how to figure out how to tune the antenna and work on the power management side, or the the architecture to improve current consumption. There's a lot of switching content, and of course, as you know, we're doing high performance GPS and LNAs and WiFi devices. So you should continue to see more dollar content, more functional content from Skyworks in each successive rollout and design. That's what you should expect.", "Operator", "A question from the line of Alex Gauna of JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could -- if I could take another step -- stab at this, Dave, and ask you about LTE exposure disjuncture. Maybe if just limit the question to PA opportunities specifically tuned for LTE. Is that maybe 5% or less of your mix or 10% of your mix or less, ballpark, and what could it go to by the end of the year as your mix improves?", "David J. Aldrich", "If I understand, Al, among our PA segment of the business, LTE is much higher than 5% or 10%. The only -- my only comment earlier was really meant to point out that we tend to tally the revenue and the content at which LTE may be a functional block or just simply one transmit path. So I don't have the number at my fingertips exactly, what percentage is, but it is increasing rapidly, and it's much higher than single digits.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I was wondering if you could talk about the backlog coverage for the current quarter and maybe what the turns were last quarter and what you need to do to make that into this quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "It's quite similar. Our -- we're largely booked. I'll call it 80% to 90%. That, plus our Hub contract, give us a great deal of comfort that we put an appropriately conservative model out there.", "Donald W. Palette", "Pretty much fully covered when you include the Hub forecast, Alex.", "Operator", "And the next question from the line of Harsh Kumar of Stephens.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. First of all, I know, Don, you said expect the mix to be 60-40 again. But is there any standout category or any particular end market that's a stand out in the March quarter for you guys?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Well, I would say -- we talked about it a bit here. You're starting to see more traction outside of mobile. The 802.11ac opportunities, although they will address handsets in the second half, right now we're seeing a nice swing out here with routers. We've got MIMO contents so we could have 2 to 3 streams of devices in a single router. We've got some nice uptick now in our ZigBee portfolio, spanning home automation and security, we mentioned a few of those in the opening comments. So there's a lot of diversification outside of mobile that is moving us above seasonality and then we have some nice design wins that we're putting in place today in handsets that will affect us in the second half.", "David J. Aldrich", "We're also seeing some lighting in display, power management products that are ramping incrementally for a relatively small base, but those are products that we either acquired or have developed in the last couple of years that have -- that we have been presenting to our mainstream customers where we're starting to gain traction as we provide more of that overall system solution. We're seeing the same thing with more customers for our LNA products, and we continue to take share and ride the growth of WiFi.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great. As I -- I mean, listening to your commentary and again reading the press release, seems like a lot of good things happening in the high-performance analog. And I think you just answered my second question. Seems like you're on a -- would you agree that you feel like you're at an inflection point with respect to that business?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think we had a -- it's been a long investment. We've been investing in building out the marketing and the design infrastructure and the product building blocks and now the solutions. We've been doing that now going on 6 or 7 years. So -- but we are beginning to see sequential growth as we have more content, and we're able to leverage the existing relationships we have. So these products are becoming more battle hardened. We are becoming more established with a footprint in the designs, and we're starting to see a snowball effect if that's what -- I think that's what you mean.", "Operator", "A question from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You mentioned the antenna tuning wins in your preamble. I was wondering if you could just kind of frame your thoughts on just the overall market there and when you expect to be shipping in phones?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, actually, we are shipping antennas tuning solutions today using a number of different architectures and topologies. We think it is an increasingly important part of the architectures when you look at multimode, multiband and LTE. And what antenna tuning does is it effectively -- synthetically lengthens or shortens the antenna to improve matching, and Skyworks have some great IP around this. So what we're doing today is leveraging our switch technology SOI and pHEMT, also some of our developments, integrated solutions and packaging technologies to deliver custom solutions. So we are in production with antenna tuning, quite frankly it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. You have to look at each customer, each OEM, what their antenna is doing what bands they have, manage coexistence and filtering, in some cases. But we think it's going to be a powerful revenue driver for us for many years. It's early days for this, and we're well-positioned at the start.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And maybe if you could address -- you talked about 2G but maybe just address the overall emerging market and low-end 3G market, whether you're seeing any uplift there and kind of what the inventory picture is and how you're positioned?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure. This is Dave. We don't see any inventory position there so inventory position is lean and appropriately so, for us. We typically address that market through a combination of distribution and direct. I would say about the 2G market, the beauty of some of these emerging markets is that, at China in particular, is that we are now seeing an inflection point where 2G, 3G, smartphones, high-performance devices are proliferating throughout that market. So there's a great deal of more content. Some of them have -- a lot of these phones have backward compatibility or they may, in fact, have a transmit path on 2G but they are 3G. Smartphones with a lot more contents, a lot more bands, a lot more filtering, a lot more switching, more WiFi connectivity just like the rest of the world. 2G is a standalone product, is -- has declined -- continues to decline perhaps mid-single-digit percentage of our revenue. That market is crowded with competitors. The ASP pressure is high and in fact customers simply don't want -- making -- successful customers making the transition to more high-performance smartphones and devices, simply don't want a discrete 2G PA. They want someone to integrate that solution into entire transmit and receive path. So you won't see much 2G standalone component business at Skyworks, it's simply not an attractive market. We're looking to facilitate the upgrade cycle to the smartphone.", "Operator", "And the next question from the line of Anthony Stoss of Craig-Hallum.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Don, could you talk about your in-house capacity utilization, and maybe start with the percent that you guys manufactured in the December quarter versus subcontracted out, if you will? And then, Dave, could you talk about where you stand on your BAW filter products and how competitive you think you'll be?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure, Anthony. As far as utilization, I think it's consistent with the discussions we've had in the past. When you look at that utilization, we really look at it in 2 forms and one is sort of a equipment line utilization and the other is facility, square footage, bricks and mortar utilization. As far as the lines and the equipment again, we're fully utilized. That's been consistent for us for a long period of time. When you look at our ability to ramp production when you look at square footage utilization, we've got, particularly in Mexicali, we have square footage available. So for Shore Capital, we're able to expand capacity and drive incremental margin benefit because there's a fairly significant cost differential for us to do that internally versus externally. As far as internal versus external, how we actually source that, when you look at the last quarter, our HBT -- our GaAs wafer supply was about 20% externally sourced and 80% internally sourced. And then you got a keep in mind that as we've continued to grow in some of these bolt on opportunities that we've talked about, we're sourcing more and more of our products, they're silicon-based, and we're sourcing more and more of those from the outside. But as far as the GaAs goes, it's about 80/20 on the wafer supply.", "David J. Aldrich", "This is Dave. I think the second question was around filters. Let me try to clarify. We participate in filters as part of an integrated power amplitude -- tune to a power amplifier in the same of package of PAD. SkyOne has the complete suite of filters for all frequency and band. But we don't sell discrete filters. That's not our business. In these applications, in fact, today we're one of the largest integrators of filters in the world today. And let me kind of give you a sense for it. Below 2 gigahertz or so, we use SAW-based product. Their performance is high, the cost is low. And when then there's narrow spacing, so in other words, when their band's on top of one another at transmit and receive on top of one another in that market, we use temperature-compensated surface acoustic devices, temperature-compensated SAWS. That allows us to eliminate the temperature drift and have real spot-on performance. In very high frequency bands or bands -- AM bands that were -- again the TR is right on top of each other, transmit and receive, while the bands themselves are -- there isn't a lot of adjacent frequency gap. We do use some bulk devices for high frequencies, BAW, primarily Bulk Acoustic Wave, and that's an appropriate technology for high frequency. And so there's always a trade-off between a SAW does well and what a BAW does well and what a temperature-compensated SAW does well.", "We have strategic partners aligned for each of these devices today we are in production. And it gives us a great deal of flexibility because those suppliers are different. No one in the world has competencies that will handle all bands and all configuration at high performance. So it's a far better return profile. And we think -- and gives us a great deal more supply flexibility to work with the best process technology for given the existing application and band configuration. And we're doing that across the board today.", "Operator", "And the next question is from the line of Dale Pfau of Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Don, you've sort of danced around this, but maybe you could talk a little bit about the share of your products that are going the outside foundries versus internal, and how that's going to affect our margins. And can we get some margin expansion over the course of the year? Is the mix going to shift or the utilization get better? But how are we going to get some margin expansion here?", "Donald W. Palette", "No, it's consistent with what we've talked about in the past. First of all, as we continue to grow, we've got a 15% top line growth opportunity. We're going to get a significant benefit both in what we in-source, the manufacturing internally and we manufacture externally, we'll get a margin benefit in that. So that's point number one. Number two is, as we continue to move -- as the margins that we get on this incremental dollar content that we're getting, that both Dave and Liam would talk about, is accretive to the overall Skyworks margins. So as we see the greater and greater attach rate for GPS/LNAs, for instance, for WiFi devices. All of that within the mobile and outside of the mobile space, that's going to add margin dollars and margin percentage to the company. So that's a real [indiscernible]. Then we're going to see a mix shift in our traditional space where power amplifiers in the handset space were primarily part of the revenue, where we're moving away from 2G to 3G low-end smartphones and high-end smartphones. All of those products have accretive margins. So it's that combination that's going to continue to drive margin expansion. And, yes, we are outsourcing content. When you look at the incremental revenue and capacity we've added through acquisitions, all of that content -- and it's silicon-based, all that's outsourced. So that's been a consistent part of what we've been done in order to drive the margin profile for the last year, 1.5 years. That's not new.", "Dale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And then as one follow-up, as your content hits would increase in the system architecture and customer dealing with the system, at what point do your customers get a little twitchy about having so much content with one supplier? Or have we already crossed that bridge?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think -- Dale, this is Dave. I think we crossed that bridge. If you look at it from a -- as the front-end complexity, if you will. By the front end, I mean analog, analog-mixed signal RF. As that complexity begins to rival the complexity in the applications processor in the modem and the overall system and it has a big, huge impact on the overall performance of the device itself, it is increasingly becoming -- they need a best system solution that is integrated, that's bundled, that's shielded, that's bulletproof. And just as most of our OEM customers have gotten over the fact that they're going to have custom baseband, for example, they're going to have a custom front end, and I think we just need to make sure that we have flawless execution on the supply chain side, high yields, never have reliability hiccups, and we're good at that. So I think they have crossed that bridge. Some more than others. Some like to generate more competition. But the fact is, that is increasingly a custom business, and very few customers are going out and shopping for the best discrete component. So very few, if any. And so we think that, that ability to integrate by keeping a broad technology footprint, by keeping our cost structure low, by being able to integrate both the semiconductor, as well as the module, the laminate and the passive gives us an opportunity to add a lot of value for our customers. And as long as we continue to support them as we have, I don't think there's an issue with that.", "Operator", "And the next question is from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I had a couple of questions. When you look at your -- when you look at last year, you had good traction, the top couple of question why you did very well. Just wondering as you look at fiscal '13 or we look at 2013 here, how you look at -- how you feel as your top customers, how do you see those guys ramp? How do you guys -- how are you guys doing on the new platforms coming out, the market share there?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think that we well, in the mobile smartphone portion of our business, you will -- you should think about us having the kind of penetration and concentration that the market, the overall market has. So unlike many, we do participate with all the leading -- all the OEMs, and we participate on all the baseband providers, reference designs and systems. So we will look an awful lot like the market. We'll exceed the growth of the market because we're bolt on more content, and the demands of the market are looking -- customers are looking for more of the kind of solution we provided versus point products. That's good for us.  So I think you should continue to look at it that way. I would expect you to see subsequent design iterations with our customers maintaining the content that we have today in the functional blocks, in which we participate. But seeing us bolt on more content, more shielding, more filtering, and switching, and all the rest.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. I mean, as a follow-on to that, success for us in 2013 and 2014 and beyond isn't just execution in the front end, where we're we've been successful. But now you're really going to see and you're just starting to see it now. ASM, antenna tuning being bolted on, multiple bands of WiLAN 802.11ac, display devices, LED backlight, camera flash, and a whole suite of power management, so that the opportunity around the center of the plate in multimode, multiband PAs and LTE is there. And we're going to execute, but we can really surround that with some complementary devices in analog and mixed signal and drive not only revenue but margin.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And the 802.11ac that you just mentioned, how big is it now? And how do you expect that growth year-on-year, if you could give us some color on whatever?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, it is a small percentage of our WiLAN portfolio today. It's going through an upgrade cycle from 11n. We think it's going to accelerate, but we love the opportunity. It's early. We're moving fast. We've got great relationships with the OEM partners in the chipset side, and we like the applications that are being driven by 11ac. It's going to enable quite a bit of interesting new consumer level applications.", "Operator", "And the next question is from the line of Nitin Kumar of BNP Paribas.", "Nitin Kumar - BNP Paribas, Research Division", "My quick question on the pricing environment, especially on the handset side. I know content has been increasing and -- but like has been mentioned before, there's been some weakness in the higher and and more momentum in the lower end of the spectrum. Have you guys any seen pricing pressure or anything like that?", "David J. Aldrich", "We've seen pricing pressure be the most dramatic on the point products in 2G. We've seen increasing content offset any pricing pressure on the mid- to high-tier products or smartphone products, whether they'd be low, mid or high end, and a more normalized pricing pattern with these newer devices. We need to be on a path to continue to add value. We've been able to sweep in more functionality so that our customers pay us more, even though for the individual functional block, they're seeing enough value that they can meet their bill of material cost objectives. And that's our goal.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, and if you look that actual year-over-year price erosion number that we track and monitor very closely, we're tracking pretty much at that same 9% number that we've seen over the last few years. So anything new. The only -- at the low-end, as they said, there's been maybe a little bit more pressure, but overall our percentage is in line with what it's been historically. So that points to the upside in some of the other parts of the market.", "Nitin Kumar - BNP Paribas, Research Division", "I know linear products has been very strong, and I think, Dave, you mentioned automotives. As you sit here in the cycle, what are your thoughts for the rest of the year in terms of 2013? Do you see an improvement from this point on or any specific thought?", "David J. Aldrich", "I see the continuing -- a few years ago, we were kind of 80/20 on the mobile FAS space. FAS being dominated by transmit power. We are now more like 60/40. I see that trend continuing to be more balanced as we ramp vertical markets and as we add more content within our mobile customer systems than simply the transmit chain, and more system solutions, more functionality. So I think you will see the trend of more dollars and a more balanced portfolio, both in terms of a number of markets we address, the verticals we're penetrating, but also in terms of the amount of content we have, and how diverse it is within a smartphone for example.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mike Burton of Brean Capital.", "Mike Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to talk a little bit about the -- if you could give us a little color about ET? When does that really become important to you? Do you have PAs to work with Qualcomm? And maybe to your strategy there, are you developing your own pHEMT or is it as a partner? And do you view ET as an opportunity for Skyworks to differentiate?", "David J. Aldrich", "Let me clarify that a little bit. That's a good question, Mike. ET is important. And for the big baseband providers out there, and you mentioned one, ET will be integrated as part of the chipset. And the system, the front-end PA system, if you will, is being quite customized around high performance to dovetail into that chipset solution. So it's not an ET PA as much as it is a PA that's optimized to deliver envelope tracking in the overall system architecture. So it is very important. And in fact for the first reference designs -- for the first designs that are hitting the market, we are the reference design with our multimode PA on the largest chipset supplier's ET System. So we are -- it is a growth driver for us. Most chipset suppliers, the large ones, at least, will facilitate ET, and there'll be a partnership between what the PA does. It won't be a separate PMIC for ET that the PA supplier provides. It will be more providing the right PA, maybe antenna tuning and bolting around it. There will be some small percentage of the market in our view that will have a discrete ET device. And we've been working on those devices. We have that capability. We also as you know, we bought a power management company. We've got PMIC capability. And that DC to DC converter technology gives us an advantage to drive the supply voltage and drive the transmit chain. So it's a good opportunity for us. We're leading today on the reference design with the largest, and we're excited about it.", "Mike Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And also your view on the CMOS PA market. You guys obviously bought the volume supplier at the time when you bought Axiom. Can you maybe size that market for us now? That market is progressing to some day capture low-end 3G. And if so, what sort of impact would that have on the space and for Skyworks obviously?", "David J. Aldrich", "The low-end CMOS PA market is tiny, frankly, because the 2G market continues to decline in units and in price. We do CMOS. We do low-end gallium arsenide. We do very cost-effective front-end modules to take that PA and integrate it with switch and control and logic to have it more integrated solution. But we're finding that the market for those discrete 2G products is dwindling. And so it's not frankly not a very attractive market for us. It's maybe 5% or 6% of our revenue, and it will not be accretive to margin. That's just not the way that market's going to play out. It is, however, 2G, you need backward-compatible to 2G in these low-end smartphones. And so that is where we're focused on. Integrated devices, there'll be CMOS content, there'll be gallium arsenic content, there'll be silicon germanium and SOI content in that transmit path. And we're really quite agnostic with respect and indifferent with respect to which technology it is.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Aalok Shah of DA Davidson.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just if I just pick your brain real quick on WiFi, especially on the 802.11ac. A lot of companies tell us there's, of course, the 2 bands. And some companies were in the couple, some were in the high band, some in the low band. How do you guys attack that market? are guys going after both? And how do customers kind of view that opportunity for you guys?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure. Well, first of all, we absolutely are attacking both bands, 2, 4 and 5 gig. And we have been, for the most part, the incumbent supplier in 11n. So in many cases, it's continuing to fortify the chipset partnerships that we have with the 2 leading players. And we have very strong positions with both. It's taking our current customers through the upgrade cycle. We were very early in sampling the technology, again provided by the support of our baseband partner. So we look at an absolute upgrade cycle at 2, 4 and 5 gig. We're seeing, as I mentioned before, MIMO, multiple streams and routers and access points that really magnifies the content. And then by and large, the handsets that we see today are going to go 2, 4 and 5 gig as well. So there's a lot of momentum there. I think if you listen to what Broadcom said as an example, how bullish they, we're right by them on those designs. So 2, 4 and 5 gig absolutely. I think if you look out a few years, there's some opportunities for us to integrate that into a single solution. But we are very well positioned in, quite frankly, what customers that we have solid relationships with.", "Aalok K. Shah - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Are you guys [ph] preferred vendor or preferred partner with Broadcom? We heard multiple different competitors of yours talk about the market and how they're well positioned with Broadcom. Can you describe how you think your relationship with Broadcom is?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Well, we think our position is very strong. We've been a partner for quite a while. And if you go back to our partner, SiGe, that we've acquired a year ago, that they had been involved there for years. So the relationship is solid. They're a lead player. There's others. And our position, we believe, is very strong.", "Operator", "Next question, from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Dave, can you give us an update on SkyOne, the design activity, the revenue ramp over there?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure, Ittai. SkyOne, just as a refresher, SkyOne is a product that moves from the baseband chipset, the output of the baseband chipset through the antenna and back. It has all switching control, logic, filters, all filter bands and PAs. And it's really, Ittai, it's really a platform because we have devices that are going to be for more network-specific customers, who look to be more narrow, geographically. Others for the world phone market. The idea is that it's completely shielded and integrated that we take the analog complexity away for which we get paid for, which is nice. So we have released that product. We have it in various stages of qualification with at least 3 OEMs, and you will see that product ramping throughout 2013. It's just beginning because it's a very different architectural approach, and our customers need to get comfortable with it and go through the qualification of the sourcing, reliability, analysis, and it looks very good. So it's going be a good for us. It's going to  -- it'll take a little while. It'll ramp faster than most because the ASP is very high. But nonetheless, it'll take a little while.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. And another follow on to that, Ittai, is that if you think about the R&D burden putting out a smartphone, the next-generation smartphone, what our customers need to do in terms of industrial design and display and performance that have nothing to do with RF. There's a tremendous amount of R&D burden, budget and challenge that is moving towards the display and look and feel. The RF budget is getting smaller, so we have an opportunity to come in and really solve that problem with multiple bands, antenna tuning and switching. We can make it configurable. So SkyOne really can be modulated and customized depending on the needs and the bands of the end OEM. So we are seeing that value being delivered and received with our customers, and we think it's great opportunity.", "Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just to follow-up on that now. Correct me if I'm wrong, it was my impression that you have already revenue for that in the March quarter. Is that not true? And as a follow-up question, can you talk about China? Your business activity there sequentially in December, and how do you expect that to be in the March quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "Ittai, with respect to SkyOne, I think given the rate of qualification you will see in the spring, if there's anything in March, it will be de minimis, it will be very small. So what was the second half?", "Liam K. Griffin", "With respect to China, what we've talked about here for a couple of calls is that kind of a smaller 2G business right now. So we have a lot of great relationships with companies like MediaTek and Spreadtrum. But the 2G business for us right now is getting smaller, and that's totally okay. Now to combat that though, on the upside, we're seeing some pickup in 3G. We're seeing better performance our of Huawei and ZTE. We're seeing performance out of Lenovo, for example, on smartphones. So we're seeing that migration from low-end single band GSM 2G to an upgrade cycle in 3G. It's playing out quite nicely.", "Operator", "And the next question, from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, just wanted to ask 2 quick questions. You spent a lot of time on the call talking about the bolt-on content around the traditional transmit chain. But as you look forward in 2013, 2014, given the trends toward sort of multimode converged PAs or wider band PAs, do you think that the actual PA content starts to level out or actually declines and your overall content growth comes from this bolt-on analog content?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, it's hard for me to distinguish. The content that will grow will be given the band proliferation. There'll be some architectures that we'll use on multimode PA. So while there have been more band that will tend to keep the price of the MMMB up and consistent, but clearly the cost per band needs to drop, right? It's got to scale somehow. It's got to be some semiconductor integration advantage on the MMMB. But where those customers will use an MMMB, there'll be some very -- the [indiscernible] filter is  very, very complicated: complex filtering, switching, logic and control. So it's a great deal more content than the switch and on some of the other bolt-on functionality. So you kind of get to the same place of growing TAM, but in the case of an MMMB, you would see some integration advantage of the PA.", "The other bolt-on you're talking about are quite independent, which is the GPS products, the power management products, the antenna tuning, the WiFi, and that will be bolt-on. And we continue -- we think there's going to be growth for us as the system becomes more important than the individual device. That will facilitate growth for us for the next several years.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And just on the ET question. You talked about the tight coupling with the chipsets. Does that mean you end up having to do specific PAs for each reference design, or is the ET PA broad enough that it can interface with multiple chipsets or multiple vendors' ET chipsets?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think it's quite unique per chipset and oftentimes will be customized by customer platform. Not only the PA, but the power management scheme, the PA device and the antenna tuning.", "Liam K. Griffin", "And having said that, there's a limited universe of suppliers that have the sophistication to handle that matching. Having power management in our wing is definitely an advantage for us.", "Operator", "Next question, from the line of Tom Sepenzis of Northland.", "Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division", "I just wanted to -- I had a couple quick housekeeping things. One, can you -- I think your tax rate is going to be 7% for the rest of the year, is that correct?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, that's correct.", "Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division", "And what is driving the low rate?", "Donald W. Palette", "We had guided to 7.5%. The change from 7.5% to 7% was really just the passing of the recent tax legislation. They confirmed that they were going to extend the R&D tax credit and bonus depreciation. So that's what drove it down from 7.5% to 7%. When you look at our 7.5% and compare it to others in the space, we have a very competitive tax rate. And it's really a result of what we've been doing with some business restructuring initiatives. And that's really helped us drive that rate to a very, very competitive level. But that small changes because of the legislation.", "Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division", "And do you expect that to continue beyond 2013 and into 2014?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, we don't guide. Guiding the rate is hard because it's based on the whole elements of earnings and -- but what we've said is that as earnings and revenue grow, it's not linear. So that rate probably is going to roll up a little bit. And I think if you're looking at beyond '13 and '14, I think using a lot [ph] [indiscernible] rate is probably pretty competitive. But again we haven't specifically guided that. But it is going to go up a little bit.", "Operator", "And next question, from the line of Edward Snyder of Charter Equity.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Dave, you look at over the landscape a little bit longer term than the next couple of quarters. You've got a lot of excess cash capacity in the industry right now. You got MMPAs, dual-band pads, things that are compressing the overall GaAs ASP per band I would say. And at the same time, as you've mentioned and as some you have pointed out, the filter business is starting to boom, especially in the BAW side of the thing. We've got these new antenna tuners as a new technology out here. Skyworks is very strong in the analog side of the business. Would it be unreasonable expectation to suggest that maybe the business models starts moving more to that direction. I don't want to say away from GaAs, of course, but maybe less of an accent just on the kind of classic historic RF GaAs business? And where does that put Skyworks, given you're likely not going to get into the BAW side or even SAW given the unit volumes? Would you be pushing more into some of the more infrastructure fragmented markets and then maybe away from such a large reliance on RF GaAs?", "David J. Aldrich", "And I would say that you've already seen a transition where a few years ago, or a couple we were 80/20, 80 mobile, most of which was gallium arsenide. Today, that number is getting closer to half-and-half. And within the PA space in the transmit side, we've got a mix of technologies. And you're right about too much GaAs capacity. But I'd characterize it this way: For those who are -- who have a good broad footprint and are gaining content with the smartphone leaders and the like, capacity utilization is not an issue, and we don't believe will be an issue for years to come. If you don't have that broad footprint, you have to try to fill vertically integrated capacity, and you do it by dropping prices on 2G PAs, for example, and that's not good from a return standpoint, and that's not our business model. So you should continue to see the diversification go on.", "And, Ed, while we don't participate in BAW filters or discrete filters of any type, that's not our business. That's mostly -- our Japanese suppliers are in that business, and they tend to -- they've had decades in that business. We are a leader anytime that filter is tuned with and integrated with a PA: SkyOne, PADs. Look at paradigm reports for customers who use PAD. And we see margin-accretive products where we can gain a lot of content and value by tuning that filter in PA using different technologies depending upon the band configuration. So we're using a combination of SAW -- temperature compensated SAW and BAW devices. We expect to be a leader in filters in the sense that when the filters are tuned on the transmit side to a PA.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "And so to the safe kind of point, you've always been kind of a leader on the cost side of the GaAs business. You got your own assembly test, which is unique in the industry. RF Micro just picked up Amalfi, was formerly the largest 2G supplier. RF Micro's pretty big in 2G enough. They certainly are the largest. And from our check, it sounds like pricing has eased a bit. Skyworks was early in the CMOS. It's not a big part of your business now or I would expect neither is 2G. But if that segment starts to grow and the margin starts to -- or at least ASP start to rise a bit given there's less competition today than it was a year ago, is that an area where Skyworks could possibly grow? You still have the Axiom product lines. I don't know how much they've been updated over the several years that you've had them, but given your cost advantage in testing and assembly, is that something that could be reasonably assumed in outyears if we see growth in the area that Skyworks should move back in?", "David J. Aldrich", "No, I think you should assume that where 2G is required in backward compatibility for low-end smartphone, for example, Skyworks will be a leader there. And it will be a mix of technologies that will have CMOS but we'll have silicon and insulators, some gallium arsenide for sure. I don't think you should expect growth in margin units or total TAM dollars in the 2G standalone market, whether it's CMOS or gallium arsenide. That market, that ship has sailed. I mean, that market is in a unit volume decline. And the competitors who are in that space, think of the local indigenous suppliers in that part of the world, as well as the silicon guides you talked about, we bought one. The margins in those businesses are just not consistent with the margins that we want to generate in our business model. They're very dilutive. So we just don't think investing any money in that business is good for our investors.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.www.skyworksinc.com", "Stephen Ferranti ", "Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Second Fiscal Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. While I'm pleased to report a strong performance for the second quarter with revenue and earnings that exceeded prior guidance and outpaced seasonal trends, our diversification across end markets and customers and our expanding addressable content were key factors in our outperformance. During the quarter, we posted revenue of $425 million. That's up almost 17% year-over-year. We produced operating income of $100 million. That's up 19% versus a year ago. We earned $0.48 per share, a $0.01 better than our guidance. We generated $130 million in cash flow from operations, and we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock, exiting the quarter with $459 million of cash on hand. And for the current quarter, we're guiding revenue to be $435 million, representing 15% growth through the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2013.", "Now as many of you know, the June quarter is a transitional period between the March trough and the second half ramp. Within this backdrop, our output reflects the strategic transition from some lower margin components in our portfolio towards more margin-rich custom solutions. And this is the direct result of our success in migrating customers from discrete implementations towards more integrated solutions, a win-win scenario in which we capture more content, we have fewer competitors, while our customers reap the benefit of reduced complexity at lower bond cost.", "In conjunction with this, we are forecasting strong sequential improvement in gross margin during this quarter, and we see a clear path to further margin expansion ahead. This puts us firmly on track toward our goal of delivering the growth of the mobile Internet with the financial returns of a diversified analog company.", "Looking forward, market trends continued clearly in our favor based on rising adoptions of our integrated mobile systems portfolio and a full pipeline of accretive opportunities in new vertical markets. The stage is set for above market growth through the remainder of the year and beyond.", "Now before going into more detailed market update, I'd like to turn it over to Don for an in-depth review of our financial results and outlook.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter was $425.2 million, ahead of our prior guidance of $420 million, representing better than normal seasonality and a year-over-year growth of 17%. Gross profit was $179.4 million or 42.2% of revenue. Operating expenses were $79.7 million, consisting of R&D expense of $49 million and SG&A expense of $30.9 million.", "We generated $99.7 million of operating income, yielding a 23.4% operating margin, which is a 45-basis-point improvement versus the year-ago quarter. Below the line, we recorded $1.4 million in other expenses and had a cash tax rate of 6.4%. Net income was $92 million or $0.48 of diluted earnings per share, and that's a $0.01 better than our guidance.", "Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. We generated $130.2 million in cash flow from operations. We invested $25.6 million in capital expenditures with depreciation for the quarter of $18.5 million, and we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock, representing an investment of just over $30 million. And we exited the quarter with $459 million in cash and no debt.", "And given our high confidence on our business trends, we continue to believe that repurchasing shares of our common stock represent a highly attractive use of our cash.", "Turning to our third quarter outlook. Based on current demand forecast and order visibility, we expect Q3 revenue to be $435 million, providing a solid baseline heading into the stronger second half of the calendar year. As Dave mentioned, our third quarter outlook factors in the transition of our product portfolio toward more differentiated performance-based system solutions. We continue to see the opportunity for mid-teens revenue growth.  We expect gross margin between 43.5% and 44% in the third quarter, representing over 150-basis-point sequential increase at the midpoint and that's driven primarily by improved product mix.", "We see a path to continue to drive further margin expansion in the second half and beyond. As a result, we now suggest modeling 48% incremental margins from the third quarter baseline. We project operating expenses to be roughly flat at $80 million. Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in net expense from interest income and other expense with a cash tax rate around 7%.", "Using our guidance of $435 million in revenue with gross margin at the midpoint of 43.7% and $80 million in operating expenses, we anticipate third quarter operating margins of more than 25% and EPS of $0.53 on a base of 192.5 million shares.", "We're very pleased with our performance thus far in fiscal 2013. And before turning it back to Dave, I'd like to just take a moment to put our first half results into broader context. Over the last 5 years on a comparative basis, we've grown revenue at 16% compounded, more than triple our earnings per share and cumulatively generated over $1 billion in free cash flow.", "The industry's gone through considerable change over this time through macroeconomic cycles, market share shifts among OEMs and technology evolution. Yet, through all of this, we've maintained a consistent track record of providing above market growth and best-in-class financial returns. More importantly, over this period, we have assembled a sustainable growth engine for the future, and that's fueled by healthy underlying market trends, well-defined competitive advantages and a success-driven corporate culture. All of the underlying drivers are in place for Skyworks to continue to outperform, putting us on a path to achieving our midterm business model of 30% operating margin, which, as a reminder, would generate around $3 in annualized earnings per share.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Thank you, Don. Now for the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our market opportunities in more detail, and I'll provide some perspective on why we remain so optimistic about the road ahead. There's no doubt that the world is rapidly becoming more interconnected, which began several years ago with the introduction of smartphones. Today, we're in the early stages of the next phase of this megatrend, the proliferation of universal data connectivity.", "Now it's important to keep in mind that the connectivity revolution is by no means limited to smartphones. The need for integrated, high-performance RF and analog systems is propagating across new product categories and new end markets, driving an expanded opportunity set where Skyworks is uniquely positioned.", "I'd like to share a few examples of how we're taking advantage today. First, we're serving an increasingly diverse set of vertical markets, as many forms of connectivity proliferate through -- within the Internet of Things. Connectivity is rapidly becoming an integral part of traditional analog markets like medical, industrial, automotive, smart grid, green energy, infrastructure and others. Within these markets, we're seeing tremendous success in leveraging our technology and our scale advantages for mobile into an expanding market footprint that we began building out several years ago as part of our catalog business.", "As some examples of our growth and product diversity during the quarter, we captured a number of new program wins. These include an innovative power management solution enabling photovoltaic battery charging for mobile devices; a lead position on Texas Instruments' reference designs for utility metering, street lighting, telematics and tracking systems applications; advanced infrastructure solutions for Aclara's smart gas meter products; switch modules for in-dash infotainment consoles for Ford, Kia and others; and filter resonator modules for scanners in homeland security applications. These are just a few examples of our traction within new vertical markets. In all cases, these markets are complementary to our mobile business and provide accretive new growth avenues for Skyworks.", "Second is the network of a connected home. This represents another major category of opportunity for Skyworks and one that is still on its infancy. Based on our underlying core competencies in RF mixed signal, analog and power management, we're establishing a strong footprint spanning connected devices like smart thermostats, security systems, sensors, gaming platforms, appliances, televisions and set-top boxes. Within these applications, we see performance requirements, complexity and content trending higher.", "Third is in emerging markets where we are enabling a massive smartphone upgrade cycle that is just getting underway. According to Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, Chinese local vendors alone are expected to ship over 450 million units this year, representing 80% annual growth. Skyworks has facilitated this transition through close alignment with all the major baseband providers, as well as local OEMs like Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo and others. Addressable content in these devices is 2 to 3x that of a 2G phone. And with the innovation required to deliver these advanced analog systems at the right price point, the playing field of viable competitors is narrowing.", "And fourth and finally in developed markets, our addressable content opportunity continues to rise. Complexity is exploding, as devices incorporate multiple forms of connectivity, including 4G LTE, 802.11, Bluetooth, GPS, ZigBee and Near Field, all within shrinking form factors. And on top of this, carriers and OEMs are implementing a plethora of new operating frequency bands for global data access, along with sophisticated new technologies like carrier aggregation, receive-side diversity, envelop tracking and antenna tuning to maximize spectrum utilization, data throughput and battery life. Now this all translates into new content opportunities for Skyworks. As a result, we see our addressable content ratcheting higher with each successive generation with as much as $10 to $12 of addressable content in high-end devices.", "And a perfect example of this is our SkyOne family, which uniquely integrates all amplification, switching, filtering and control in a single device. And as these specific examples illustrate whether we're talking about a mobile device or a new vertical market, the fundamental need is the same, ensuring seamless connectivity across multiple communication standards while maximizing overall system performance within the smallest possible footprint. And this underlying market need creates tremendous design challenges for our customers and opportunities for Skyworks, as they contend with issues like power efficiency, coexistence, harmonics and linearity.", "So to recap, our addressable markets are expanding, and we're capitalizing on first, end market diversification; second, the connected home; third, smartphone adoption in emerging markets; and fourth, increasing content in high-end mobile devices.", "In closing, we're quite optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2013 and beyond. Trends in our served markets are moving in our favor, and our strategy of continuing to diversify and expand into new verticals while maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working.", "That concludes our prepared comments. Operator, let's open the lines, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "The June quarter guidance, I think is somewhat below seasonal trends. Is it related to a product transition at one customer? Are there any other impacts? Or I guess, the other way of asking the question is, are you still comfortable with sort of the roughly 15% sales growth target that you had set for this fiscal year?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, first, thank you. First, historically June is up, let's say, 4% to 5% sequentially. However, more recently, it's been heavily influenced by the timing of the specific program ramps. We're also benefiting from some of new opportunities. We see strength in wireless LAN and some of our antenna switch modules. Some of our vertical markets. Antenna tuning is another example. So our Q3 guidance underscores gain from those diversification activities. And as Don mentioned in his prepared comments, we exceeded the 15% in the first 3 quarters of the year, and we're very comfortable that we can continue on a mid-teens trajectory.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then the other question is recently, we have seen more acquisitions in the CMOS RF space with Avago acquiring Javelin, and of course, RFMD bought Amalfi before. And then Qualcomm has been vocal about its RF360 solution. Is this the start of some major disruptive trend that we should be worried about? Like when you talk with your customers and look at design wins, is this a trend that's accelerating? Or is this still somewhat limited?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think that the consolidation of the CMOS players -- and we acquired a company a couple of years ago -- is a simple function of the fact that a stand-alone 2G company isn't a sustainable model I believe, sustainable economic or financial model. The unit volumes for 2G continue to decline dramatically. And what's far more important and what you're seeing in the, I think, the substantial rise in our gross margins as we go into the June quarter, as Don outlined in our guidance, is the fact that we're successfully working with our customers on migrating them to more integrated solutions where we have more content, helping them make the tough leap from 2G to 3G whether it's TD or WCDMA, as we bolt on more analog content that serves to reduce the footprint and make it easier for them to get to market and provide for us more margin-rich opportunities, and the competitive landscape is narrowing. So I think it's more simple than that, Vivek. I think it's simply not a sustainable model to be a 2G-only company.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.", "Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "This is Matt Ramsay on for Mike. I guess, the first one, maybe, Dave, one of the strengths of Skyworks' business in our view has been kind of your customer diversification and near top market share with many handset OEMs. So I guess, earlier this week, 2 of your traditional competitors in this space announced earnings and kind of talked about better trends throughout the year driven by more diversification in their businesses, as they have been recently customer constrained at particular customers. Maybe you could talk about the competitive position you have across your customer base and maybe where you see opportunities for market share gains or losses for Skyworks relative to the more bullish commentary from some of your competitors.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Well, I think it's basically outlined in the prepared comments is that we see tremendous growth for us in both margin and revenue, as we are successfully penetrating more vertical markets. We're gaining more content in the connected home, more content in the automobile, some medical applications and so on. So we're doing a very good job of rounding out our business and continuing to expand our target of addressable markets. We also are adding a lot more content. If you look at recent tear-down reports. Versus a traditional RF competitor's, we continue to participate in this wave of complexity with more bands of amplification. But we're adding increasingly more filtering, more switching, more antenna tuning, more GPS products, more power management and more Wi-Fi connectivity.  So I think what you'll see from us is not only vertical market expansion, but you'll see the TAM increasing in our core markets. And as a result of the complexity that we talk so much about, it really is the case that customers are looking for a narrower set of suppliers to provide much more of the overall system solution, and we think we're the best at that. So I would expect you to see, on the high end, more content with more functions provided by Skyworks at higher market share and increasingly a broad set of vertical markets.", "Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "That's helpful. And I guess, a follow-up to that maybe for Don or maybe even Liam, the SiGe and AATI", "Acquisitions, I guess, are both now roughly a year in the past, give or take. Maybe you could give a brief post-mortem comment on those 2 different acquisitions and their effect on your product diversification offerings. And maybe if you're willing, remind us of what the revenue run rates of those businesses were when you acquired them and how they've trended both from a sales and margin perspective since those acquisitions. That'd be really helpful.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. This is Liam. I'll give you a little color on the acquisition. Certainly, the WiLAN business saw, buoyed by the SiGe acquisition continues to be very robust and very strong for us. We're in the early stages of a 11ac product line ramp. We've got the first 11ac handset in the market today by virtue of some partnerships, Broadcom and others. We're also seeing great strength in routers and access points and quite bullish on that. And I think what we've brought to the market there is a combination of technology from the SiGe team coupled with a systems approach at Skyworks, and we've gone well beyond the initial portfolio to gain share. In addition and in parallel, the power management portfolio acquired by AATI is also making great progress in some areas. We had some releases regarding Samsung recently. We had DC to DC in camera flash technology. We started -- we're now getting into nonmobile applications, video, digital still camera, and we think the opportunity for the powers space for us is really tremendous, and we're in very early innings of upside there.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Don, just to further clarify the dynamics in gross margin, are you seeing gross margin improvement in the quarter because of increased value with new products in existing platforms and customers? Or is the gross margin uplift due to penetration of new markets and increased -- the increased margin profile that might go along with those new markets? And as a third part of that question, is there any manufacturing or sourcing element to the margin improvement that you're seeing?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes. Thanks, Craig, for the question. It's actually fairly evenly split. It's both. It's new product wins and ramps and designs, and it's also leveraging additional content with existing customers and platform. So it's a combination of both. And overall, it really relates to what we talked about earlier that it's just with the 2G component market just continuing to decline, and the product mix is successfully transitioning. We're seeing this growing adoption of the accretive portfolio towards integrated system solutions, and they're clearly margin accretive for us. And that's driving the majority of the expansion. There is a little bit of manufacturing efficiency. I mean, we do -- we see benefits from that every quarter. That's our job, to continue to do that. But the lion's share of this margin expansion relates to what we just described on the product side.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up for either you or David, typically the company gives a split-out in its revenues between linear products and cellular. Can you give us that? And can you help us understand how you see the growth dynamics of those 2 businesses as you go through the rest of the calendar year?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, the revenue from the product split of linear is 40% and handset 60%. That's similar to the percentage that we've seen over the last several quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.", "Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "First, Don, in terms of tax rate the next few quarters, what should we be thinking about? And then the same question with CapEx.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes. I would -- we're guiding for the June quarter 7%. I would keep it at that level through the September quarter when you -- actually, through December, through calendar December, and we really haven't guided anything further than that. But I think directionally, if you use 10% in '14, that's probably a safe number for modeling purposes. CapEx, I would -- what we would assume on CapEx is it's going to be above, probably a little bit above depreciation levels for the next couple of quarters, but it'll be ramping down the back end of the calendar '13.", "Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And David, I wonder if you can give us an update on SkyOne in terms of other devices shipping this year with that or design win updates or kind of how is that going in terms of sales process in the marketplace?", "David J. Aldrich", "It's been an interesting process because the product is so highly integrated. Just to recap, the SkyOne takes everything from the output of the transceiver or the chipset to the antenna and back. So it's got all the duplexing filters. It's got amplification. It's got switching. It's got frequency control and logic and so on. And so it is -- the uptake with the customers is very strong. We have several lead customers who are tuning it, putting it through its paces. It's a very different product because our customers see a lack of competition as an interesting switch from the normal paradigm in our market. It is a product that is -- that performs wonderfully because it -- while it is highly integrated is highly integrating using a mix of silicon advanced multi-chip module technology, the best filter technologies on the planet tailored for each frequency, as well as high-performance compound semiconductor amplifiers. So it's a unique product. It is very sole sourced, and so we're getting great feedback. They like it, and I think our customers are trying to digest what it means to have a supply chain now that it's completely sole sourced on the front end. You will see production this year, and the customer uptake has been very good.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering, Don, implicit with your outlook, if it anticipates a similar set of greater than 10% customers? Or are there possibilities to add a third or fourth? And then also maybe if you could talk about within the quarter, has there been any material change? Do you still have 2 greater than 10% customers? Have they converged in size or maybe inverted?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, the 10% customers for the quarter were Octagon and Samsung, which is consistent with what we've seen for the last several quarters. That hasn't changed. We really don't guide what our customer mix is going out as far as are there going to be additional customers that go into that. The top 10% is just not something that we typically would put into the forecast.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And I was wondering, you recently announced a pretty rich set of design wins, targeting Samsung's GALAXY S4 refresh. Can you give any color behind that press release? Are you seeing an average ASP increase over the S3? Some of these wins that you have, maybe what kind of dollar content we're talking about or a range? And then lastly, I believe Liam mentioned AATI on the camera flash. But if I read the press release right, you now have new wins on the RF, DC to DC RF deck with AATI, and I'm wondering how material that is.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Alex. Yes. So I think what we're looking here with the GALAXY S4, it's a great example of what Dave articulated earlier. We have our core MMMB technology, which we've been continuing to develop and gain share, gain design wins and also baseband partnerships. And the S4 is an example of that technology. But now we've wrapped around Wi-Fi technology, switch ASM, high throw, very, very highly integrated switch, DC-to-DC converters for the first time and then also some additional componentry in analog. So you've got an opportunity there that get to really see what Skyworks is capable of doing. We're quite happy that demonstrated that with a leading platform going forward, and we think this is really an indication of what you should expect from us with all the leading smartphone players.", "Operator", "Next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It's for Don or David. I just wanted to make sure I heard you right. It seems like you're reiterating your target of 15% growth for the fiscal year. I think you guys made an easy comparison in the first half. Q3 guide's below that rate. If you could talk -- if that is correct, if you could just talk about the drivers into the back half of the year for you, that would be helpful.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I think that's right, and we are comfortable with that growth rate. I think the June quarter is, as we mentioned earlier, it is becoming in our industry at least in the mobile side of our business a transitional quarter between the seasonal trough in March and what is a strong growth in the second half. And as we're confident in our platform participation and we see vertical markets continuing to expand, we see that growth rate. June is kind of a transition quarter, and I think that's kind of what you're seeing. But having said that, the growth rate through the 3 quarters is about 17%, and we're growing much faster than the overall seasonality in the June quarter if you were to aggregate everything.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then it seems like the long-term incremental gross margin, you ticked that up by -- I remember when you brought it down. A part of it was due to the mix as you're seeing a lot of growth with SOI and on GaAs. Can you just talk about what's driving the higher -- is it a different mix of products more analog? Or are you seeing a mix shift back to GaAs? That would be helpful.", "David J. Aldrich", "No, as Don mentioned, it really is -- there are ongoing continuous improvement in manufacturing efficiencies, and we continue to drive very hard for those. But the vast majority of the improvement in gross margin is the product mix and the focus we've had on more highly integrated and differentiated products where we have a much less of competition, and we add a great deal more value for our customers that they're willing to pay for. In addition to which is we are continuing to see more vertical market penetration where we get accretive gross margins across the board.", "Donald W. Palette", "But the way to think about it, Blayne, is that doesn't assume a dramatic change in the mix that we've already described between linear and handsets. So what that's saying is within those categories, we're expanding margin for those factors we talked about earlier. So that's the way to think about it. It doesn't require a big mix shift in order to drive that. That's the way to think about it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "It's very well advertised and publicized that one of your customers is going through an upgrade cycle. I know you've talked about tremendous prospects in the back half, but I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color. What makes you so excited about the September and the December quarters on the cellular side specifically?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, in the September, December quarters, you see normal seasonality, and we expect to see that as well. And at this stage of the year, we're very comfortable and knowledgeable about where we participate, what our participation is on the drivers of the market. And as Liam commented earlier, we have, not only the wind at our back with increasing complexity, driving content and Traditional RF sockets, but we are doing a really good job of adding margin-accretive products in connectivity, in power management, in Wi-Fi and then in completely integrated solutions. So it's participation in the right platforms, and its content increasing. And that content increases with higher margins almost across the board.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great. And as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the Tier 2 and Tier 3  markets. Usually in the March quarter, they tend to be a little bit shaky. Have you seen anything like that? And what are your prospects for those kind of second and Tier 3 guys, customers going forward?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Harsh. This is Liam. Actually, we think the opportunity for the Tier 2 and Tier 3 specifically in emerging markets is quite bullish. We're seeing an upgrade cycle now occurring in China specifically where 2G demand has come down a bit, but there's a commensurate upside in 3G and TD technologies. And fortunately, it's with customers who've had strong incumbency and base position, and we're working with them right now to get them through that upgrade cycle. So we're quite bullish on it. This is not a Q3 effect. This is a long-term sustainable upside. And I think our ability to deliver customized solutions, great on-the-ground application support, that systems know-how really puts ourselves in a great position to support those companies as they move up.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jaeson Schmidt with Craig-Hallum.", "Jaeson Schmidt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "First off, I was wondering how much of your revenue is currently coming from the 2G market or just get a split of the revenue of 3G, 4G and 2G.", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, 2G was 15% this quarter, and we just combined 3G, 4G was at 85%. And that's changed slightly. It had been running 80-20 for probably the last 3 or 4 quarters, so this is a little bit of a change in the 2G.", "Jaeson Schmidt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "And then Don, what should we think of your inventory level in the June quarter and then going forward?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, we had -- we just finished. We were down slightly in the March quarter from the December quarter. Our turns run roughly about 4.5. We would expect that to continue. So based on whatever you think the cost of goods sold or the revenue you're modeling, you can kind of sort of calculate that number. That's the best way to do it. But assume turns of about 4.5.", "Operator", "We have a question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "You mentioned the start that the low-margin components versus integrated was one of the reasons for the gross margin compression this period. Can you give me a little bit of example what components you're talking about in terms of low-margin products just to get our heads around how the shift is going? And then the out periods, you've been particularly strong. I think, Dave, last year, you mentioned that you're probably the biggest producer of PADs in 2012. I think that probably wound up being the case. Do you see that to be the case again in 2013? And similar with SOI, you've had a big ramp here with SOI. It sounds like it's getting stronger especially with regard to antenna tuners. So I'm just going to grasp what you see the rest of the year look like in those products specifically.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. Thank, Ed. Yes. On the margin products, let me give you a couple of examples. We were -- we've been very big in Wi-Fi and in mobile, for example, doing like 3- and 4-throw PM switches. And we've sold them by the tens of millions a quarter. We're seeing an upgrade cycle to more of a silicon-based silicon-on-insulator switch with 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, 14-, 15-throw switches with a lot of switch control embedded on the dies. So we get higher ASP at higher gross margin. That's a good example. We're seeing fewer dual band, low NPAs and more of an upgrade to a 3G or kind of a low-end smartphone transition. We see that as a benefit. Some of the ASM products and antenna products have been quite discrete. And whenever it's discrete, it implies that the barrier to entry's a little bit lower, so you see more competition. You see more price pressure. We're seeing less opportunities for those kind of products. And with the number of bands and the complexity in the number of antennas, we see that, and we're leading that upgrade to far more integrated products. And I do think we'll be the largest producer of filters integrated with PAs. We will not be the biggest producer of filters, of course, because that's not our strategy. But we will be the biggest supplier, I believe, in 2013 and 2014 in filters that are matched with the transmit chain.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Excellent. And then in terms of your SOI products, since you seem to be really accelerating there, are you open to grabbing market share through some of the module manufacturers given they often times have access to design wins that aren't open to specifically a lot of -- Murata, specifically with the LTC substrate, et cetera? Is that something that Skyworks would be interested in given the outsourcing kind of model you have? It doesn't add any CapEx for you to do that. You could use your designs. I'm just curious about your business model for the SOI.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, Ed. this is Liam. We have great position and relationships with all the key module manufacturers. Some of those have been born through Wi-Fi opportunities. And we speak with them all the time about opportunities to look at our portfolio whether it be in die form or chip scale. And we'll get those goes out, and if they make sense, we'll absolutely execute there. So I think it's something that's on our radar screen. We've been doing very well today with fully packaged products that have been coming out of Skyworks and packaged in our Mexicali site and doing quite well. But we have an open mind on what our customers want and our partners and would certainly look hard at that opportunity.", "Donald W. Palette", "And for us, we really instill a lot of discipline on the margin side. So to the extent that our module manufacturer needs our technology and we'll pay such that it has strong -- a good margin performance, we'll do it. We do have some instances of that, but we won't chase it if it's dilutive.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mike Burton with Brean Capital.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I just -- I'm sorry if I missed this, but what's the percent of HPA versus cellular? And then within that, you have done clearly well on the Wi-Fi product. I'm wondering if you could break out Wi-Fi for us. And then also, you gave us the mix on 2G, 3G, 4G, but Dave, I'm wondering if you can give us your thoughts about where you think that percentage is going to trend towards and what that does to your margins.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes. Just, Mike, the percentage was 40% linear and 60% handset smartphones, which is where we've been running.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think, Mike, the answer to the second part of your question is I think it will continue to accelerate. I believe that the -- we passed the crossover where the upgrade cycle is now -- there's more revenue being derived and obviously, much, much higher growth rates being derived from that low-end smartphone, if you will, versus the 2G phone. So I think that's going to continue to accelerate. So Don said it used to 80-20. It's now 85-15, 3G, 4G versus 2G. I suspect you will continue to see that. And in virtually every single case, an upgrade cycle is a product that's more integrated and carries higher margin with fewer competitors.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then any signs or updates on RF360 since Barcelona? I mean, have you seen that at customers? And do you have any more intel on how it compares in -- to your product offerings?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, sure. I think that we have seen it with some customers. We are partnering with Qualcomm today on some of the most exciting platforms in the market, so that relationship is very strong. I think the market niche they're trying to address, we're also addressing, which is driven by the exploding complexity in RF. It's not a \"one size fits all\" market I will say. Customers are making solution around more customized. However, I'll say this. There is -- there may be a narrow segment that does have less stringent performance requirements that could utilize a preconfigured, let's call it, a system in a package. And in this case, we compete with the SkyOne product. It's fully configurable, and it also has -- uses the best performance, has the best performance using the best process for function. So it'll be interesting, as we talked about earlier, to watch SkyOne uptake because it is highly customized. The difference is it's also high performance, and it is very configurable.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just on the gross margin side, I know your gross margins expanded nicely versus peers and obviously, your top line, too. But as you look at the levers there with production mix and the 2G coming down, how do you see long-term trends on the gross margin? You're already close to your 44% target. How do you see that over the next couple of quarters?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, yes, Vijay, the easiest way to model that is you've got the new guidance here, so that's the start-off point. And as you layer in incremental revenue, we'd suggest you do the drop-through at 48%. As I said, that assumes no significant shift in the linear handset mix, and obviously, we've been very vocal our goal to continue to grow that. If that happens, that drop-through gets better. So there's upside to that. But for modeling purposes, we're saying this is 48%. That's how you can look at the different scenarios and see where we're going be at different revenue level.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then you mentioned the 15% growth year-on-year that you should still be good with. That would imply the pretty nice snapback as you look at September and should bounce back by [ph] 10%, 12% on the top line. But is that more driven by the cellular side? Obviously, that tends to be more product cycle driven.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. I mean, our second half outlook, I mean, we're not guiding the full year, but we certainly expect to grow both cellular, the analog within mobile and also the diversified markets. I think it's a combination. And if you look at the margin opportunity that Don outlined, we're going to drive margins in every category. There's a lot of great technology going on in our core cellular as we roll out complex MMMB solutions, as we rollout SkyOne. There's accretive analog that we can bolt right on into mobile, and then we have adjacent verticals that are very rich in margin. And quite frankly, we have a lot of headroom to grow there.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Dave, previously, you've talked about the China white box 2G segment of the business being only about 5% of sales. With 2G declining, my guess is it's even lower than that now. But with emerging market, smartphones being a significant opportunity and growing 80% year-on-year, can you give us some sense what is emerging market smartphones or 3G phones for you today and how do you see that ramping over the next several quarters?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I think you're right. Just to be clear, that 15% of our revenue is derived from 2G. About 1/3 of that is true open market -- true open market, for example, on a media; tech reference design. We've already passed the crossover point where we're generating more revenue, substantially more revenue on 3G that's going into the low end of the market. And as I think we cited a source earlier, like 80% this year growth in the emerging smartphone. I think that business is a strong growth driver for us. And our reference design position is stronger in the sense that we have products that carry a higher ASP. And with our chipset partners in that space, we are first on their bills materials as they enter the market. So I am very pleased with our position for the chipset partners who are well positioned in open market with higher dollar content with far fewer competitors. This is going to be a great market for the next 3 years.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then as a quick follow-up, one of your competitors on their call talked about securing additional capacity for filters. You talked about your expectations being one of the largest sellers of filter-based product this year where you partner with third parties. Can you talk about whether you're seeing the filter supply getting tight in the market? Or you are comfortable that you have adequate access to both SAW and BAW filters going forward to meet your demands?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I am satisfied, although it's come with a great deal of work with our supply chain team and a lot of partnering, lots of discussions, lots of airline miles. So we have teams and folks that have been working, that have worked daily with our filter partners, and there are multiple partners because there isn't one size fits all for filter technology. And so we've got their attention as we are the ideal partner. Think about it. If you're a filter supplier and you don't make PA, whereas the big filter suppliers do not, then we're the perfect partner. We're the market share leader, and we have had a very clear strategy that we don't intend to produce filters. So that makes us the perfect partner, and we have -- we're getting good capacity answers from them as they continue to invest. So I'm comfortable with -- that we have the capacity.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Cody Acree with Williams Financial.", "Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "Dave, with the linear and the cellular mix being relatively steady, with all of the opportunities outside of cellular that you highlighted from the initial comments on, a little surprised that maybe -- I guess, first off, do you expect that to remain relatively steady? Or into the out orders, do you expect to see maybe that linear piece start to outpace?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think over time, the linear piece will outpace. But Cody, let me be clear. Within a mobile platform, for example, we have our PA products. And if you look at it, I think the great example is we try to demonstrate that with the press release on the Samsung S4. If you look at the content, I think there's 8 parts on that device and only a couple of PAs. So it is the case that we will have a lot more analog and even some mixed signal and power management type content in mobile devices, while we also round it out with increasing vertical markets.", "Cody G. Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division", "And so if you look at that 40/60 split, if you have to look down -- I guess, when you look at it this way, but you looked down at your bottom line. What does that split look like given the margin difference between the 2 profiles?", "Donald W. Palette", "The step-back and you look at the split, it's going to be a little higher percentage for the linear piece because that business overall has better margins and better returns, so -- but we don't -- we wouldn't provide that exact percentage. But the takeaway is that, that number would be higher.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, we don't segment the business because we're using the same basic core manufacturing and design platforms across. That's the beauty of our business model, right? So the analog products that we develop for mobile, we also, then, reconfigure those for specific system performance in these vertical markets. They do pass, so we think about it as sort of contribution margin. The contribution margin is higher in those vertical markets, but the volume is much lower. So we have more margin dollars in mobile. We have higher contribution, but when you blend it all together, we come up with an accretive model.", "Operator", "We will go next to Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "First of all, you're talking more about the connected home, Internet of Things, machine-to-machine opportunities. How do you see those opportunities grow? I mean, can units start becoming material, perhaps, rivaling phones one day? And also, what are the margins there given that these are somewhat low-bandwidth opportunities, perhaps cost sensitive?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure. We think the connected home and the Internet of Things is a real significant upside for the overall industry, the wireless industry, the connected industry. And we've had some early success with ZigBee technology and smart energy. We've done a lot of good work with utility and metering companies. We've moved into home automation. We've now also moved into smart appliances, thermostats and even white good appliances, Whirlpool, for example. So we think that this could be a tremendous opportunity for the market. Fortunately for Skyworks, we do have some technology in works data like [ph] ZigBee, we mentioned. There's implementations in Wi-Fi that could be beneficial for us. So we think we can outperform in this space, and it has an entirely different demand curve and market structure than what we see in mobile. So we're looking forward to it, and the margin there should be accretive.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And my follow-up is guidance on incremental gross margins, 48%. Is that largely reflecting just the gross margins of the new revenues coming in? Or is there also a manufacturing component there, utilizations and -- okay. So do you have like a peak capacity at this point per quarter?", "Donald W. Palette", "No. I mean, the beauty in -- that what we have is when you look at utilization, there's 2 types of utilization. There is sort of your line, your manufacturing line utilization. We run that, typically at 100% or theoretical capacity, but you also have square footage utilization, and we've got the opportunity for very short CapEx to expand. So we put ourselves in a position where we can drive the right incremental returns very efficiently, so...", "Operator", "We have a question from Tom Sepenzis with Northland.", "Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division", "I'm just curious. You've talked about several product categories in automotive and home appliances, utility metering. Do you have -- what -- how big is that business right now? And where do you see it going to over the next, let's say, 2 or 3 years?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, in aggregate, the nonmobile portion of our business is around 40%, and it is, by definition, not a very volatile group of businesses because it's so broad. So think of the classic diversified analog businesses that have certain core competencies which we've outlined, and we just keep applying them with a more system know-how in underserved vertical markets, and we get a disproportionate ASP and a lot of stickiness because the product life cycles are very, very long. So that's kind of the strategy there. It's very diversified, not terribly customer concentrated.", "Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division", "And I'm sorry if this was asked, but I'm just curious as to why the tax rate was so low and why you think it's going to remain the 7% to 10% range over the next 1.5 years?", "Donald W. Palette", "It's just based on some business restructuring initiatives that we successfully implemented and how that translates into the end of the day or cash tax rate, so something we worked very hard at. And if you go back and look at our trend, we've been effectively been able to manage that at a number around what you're seeing as 7% or so.", "Operator", "Going next, we have Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Brad Erickson", "Two quick ones for me. First, can you talk about the back half of the calendar year ramp and on the shoulders of dollar content increases? Curious to know if there's any expectation of share gain, particularly with your handset customers built into that expectation. Are you just kind of talking about basically grabbing most of the available market growth?", "Donald W. Palette", "We're making an assumption of some share gains, as we've said. If you look at our prepared remarks, our recent press releases and Samsung and elsewhere, we expect that the complexity facing our customers is playing uniquely into Skyworks' capability with a broad system footprint. And as a result, with each successive design, subsequent design in smartphone space, for example, or the tablet space, we see the need for more integration in order to hit the size, price performance requirements. And that integration plays well into the fact that we're the only supplier in this space that produces about 6 million multi-chip modules every single day. We have unique IP in how one integrates chip scale and the like. And So I think the more there is complexity, the more share we expect to gain, and the more content we expect to be able to add. That's our strategy.", "Brad Erickson", "Great. That's helpful. And then on the pricing front, can you kind of just give us an update on how the pricing environment looks? It would seem that you're obviously speaking quite bullishly around the low-end smartphone growth and historically, have talked about how the high end has sort of supported those declines you've seen in the 2G market. Can you kind of give us an update how -- if anything's changed there in terms of the pricing in the market?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. As Don and David indicated, we're taking more of a system solutions orientation to dealing with customers and working with our customers. The complexity is going way up, and the types of products that we deliver to solve that challenge or to overcome that complexity with our customers are changing rapidly. They tend to be highly customized, defensible IP, real architectural solutions. And with that approach, we've seen much less ASP pressure, and we think that will continue the vertical markets much less ASP pressure, some cases, the lower-end space where you have more of a commoditized portfolio. The ASPs will run a little faster there, but that's becoming a smaller percentage of the business.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, thank you, everyone, for participating tonight, and we look forward to seeing you in upcoming conferences.", "Operator", "Thank you, then, ladies and gentlemen.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti ", "Thanks, Lori. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' Third Fiscal Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We'll then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we'll discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. We had another strong performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, exceeding guidance across all key metrics. I'm pleased with the progress we've made towards our overarching strategic goals of diversification and market expansion. Both of these initiatives contributed towards our outperformance in the third quarter. Along with this, our growing portfolio of highly integrated, high-performance analog solutions helped to drive strong sequential margin improvement and helped to drive earning upside.", "During the quarter, we posted revenue of $436 million. That's up 12% year-over-year. We delivered gross margin of 44%, nearly a 200-basis-point increase versus the prior quarter. We produced operating profit of $112 million. That's up 22% versus a year ago. And we earned $0.54 per share, and that's up over 20% year-over-year and $0.01 better than our guidance. We also repurchased roughly 4 million shares of our common stock during the quarter and ending with a cash balance of $400 million. And finally, our return on invested capital was over 20%. This is well in excess of our cost of capital. And for the current quarter, we are guiding revenue to be up nearly 9% sequentially to $475 million, driven by contributions from new market initiatives, program ramps and share gains.", "During the fourth quarter, we'll continue to demonstrate the significant earnings leverage in our business model. Based on the outlook for strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage, we are guiding for fourth quarter EPS of $0.62, representing a 17% year-over-year growth.", "Our near-term results continue to be quite healthy, but more importantly, our long-term outlook remains very bright. We're in a unique position to capitalize as advanced forms of connectivity spread across a widening array of end markets. As our guidance implies, fiscal 2013 will be a record earnings year for Skyworks. And with our current opportunity funnel and recent design momentum, we put in place the groundwork to continue our above-market growth trajectory, realizing our vision of providing mobile Internet growth with the financial returns of a diversified analog company.", "Before going into more detailed market update, I'd like to turn it over to Don for an in-depth review of our financial results and our outlook.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining, everyone. Revenue for the third quarter was $436.1 million, slightly ahead of our prior guidance of $435 million. Gross profit was $191.8 million or 44% of revenue. That's up 180 basis points sequentially and 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2012. Our strong margin performance reflects the strategic shift in our product portfolio toward more differentiated performance-based solutions.", "Operating expenses were $80 million, in line with our guidance and consisting of R&D expense of $49.3 million and SG&A expense of $30.7 million. We generated $111.9 million of operating income, up 22% versus last year. Operating margin was 25.7%, a 220 basis-point increase versus the year-ago quarter. Below the line, we recorded $200,000 in other expenses and had a cash tax rate of 7.5%.", "Net income was $103.8 million or $0.54 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.01 better than guidance and representing earnings growth of 20% year-over-year.", "Turning to our third quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $65 million of cash flow from operations. We invested $33.4 million in capital expenditures and had depreciation of $18.5 million. We also repurchased nearly 4 million shares of our common stock, representing an investment of roughly $92 million. And we exited the quarter with $400 million in cash and no debt. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we are on a path to produce over $450 million in cash flow from operations for fiscal 2013.", "Given the positive momentum in our business and our fine confidence in our future prospects, we continue to believe that repurchasing shares of our common stock represents a highly accretive use of cash. As a result of our more aggressive activity over the last 3 quarters, we have largely completed the $200 million repurchase program that we initiated back in November 2012. We expect to remain active in the market, and to that end, we are pleased to announce that our Board has authorized a new $250 million program, providing us with a capacity for additional repurchases in the coming quarters.", "Tuning to our fourth quarter outlook. Based on our current backlog and order visibility, we expect revenue to be $475 million, up -- roughly up 9% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 44.5%. And as a reminder, going forward, we suggest modeling incremental gross margins at a 48% rate from the fourth quarter baseline.", "We project fourth quarter operating expenses to be around $81 million. Below the line, we anticipate $200,000 in expenses from interest income and other expense, with a cash tax rate around 8.5%. Putting all this together, at $474 million -- $475 million in revenue, with gross margin at the midpoint of 44.25% and $81 million in operating expenses, we anticipate fourth quarter operating margins to be over 27%, with EPS of $0.62 on a base of 190 million shares.", "In summary, we're continuing our track record of execution, producing above market growth and best-in-class financial returns. All of the underlying drivers are in place for Skyworks to continue to outperform, putting us on a clear path to achieving our mid-term business model of 30% operating margin, which, as a reminder, generates earnings per share of around $0.75 a quarter.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Don. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our ongoing diversification efforts and in more detail and provide some additional perspective on our growth ahead.", "As we touched on earlier in the call, diversification across end markets, customers and product offering has been a contributor to our recent outperformance and a cornerstone of Skyworks' long-term growth strategy. Over the last several years, we have established a strong track record of identifying high-growth market opportunities, of utilizing our technology advantages, advanced integration capabilities and customer relationships to carve out a leading share position and leveraging our scale and flexible business model to translate these revenue drivers into superior financial returns. And as our performance over the last few years indicates, we have been highly successful in executing on this strategy. And following this very same game plan, we are currently in the early innings of the next phase of growth at Skyworks, as advanced forms of connectivity expand from the mobile markets into a broader analog world. In fact, we see connectivity and mobility as being the biggest secular drivers within the analog landscape over the next several years, all of which are long-standing core competencies of Skyworks.", "So with this in mind, I'd like to highlight 3 key themes as you consider the opportunity ahead for Skyworks. First, the Internet of Things is upon us, and the opportunity is enormous. It's virtually impossible to find an end market today that is not incorporating some form of always-on access. Whether it's within mobile devices or the Connected Home, the automobile, medical devices, machine-to-machine applications or in completely new areas of innovation like smart lighting, connectivity is on the rise across a broad array of end markets. In fact, a recent white paper from Cisco Systems projects a tremendous surge in connected things within the next few years, suggesting that the number of connected devices will exceed the world's population over the next few years. And the opportunity increases even further when factoring in technologies like 802.11, ZigBee and others. In total, the market is projected to reach a staggering 50 billion connections by the year 2020. All of this translates directly into new growth avenues for Skyworks. In fact, some of our fastest-growing segments are within areas like medical, industrial, automotive and Smart Energy, where connectivity is being adopted for the very first time.", "Second, complexity is going up across our addressable markets. By all accounts, data consumption is skyrocketing and, along with it, so are the ways in which consumers stay connected by seamlessly utilizing multiple modes of connectivity. Many applications we see today involve the integration of several different communications protocols like cellular, like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and Near Field Communications to transmit sensitive signals within close spectral proximity across crowded licensed and unlicensed frequencies. Further complicating matters, customers are desperately seeking efficiency gains within their system power budgets to bring out additional battery life to support more process of power, higher resolution displays and a host of new functionality.", "Third and perhaps most important, analog complexity translates into more addressable content and higher value add for Skyworks. This technology evolution is happening today, driving our addressable dollar content higher across the board in product areas like signal transmission and switching, voltage regulation, filtering and power management, among others. And as you know, we spent the last few years broadening our technology portfolio, extending our product lines and investing in applications teams in key vertical markets to address these challenges and to create new incremental revenue opportunities for us. And as some examples of our recent success, we've captured a number of new program wins during this quarter that include a complete suite of RF and analog products for leading 802.11ac enterprise routers from Cisco, NetGear and others; backlighting and power management ICs for tablet and ebook applications; telematics and infotainment system design wins, with a strategic global automotive supplier; integrated systems incorporating mixers, down converters and IQ modulators for 4G base stations. Incidentally, these devices represent a threefold increase in content for Skyworks; and silicon-based ultra-high speed switch ICs for carrier aggregation applications.", "So in summary, it's a great time for Skyworks. And before closing, I'd like to reiterate some of the key messages from the call. Skyworks is levered directly to the global megatrend of rising connectivity attach rates across a broadening array of analog markets. Our addressable content is on the rise, driven by increasing complexity. We have the critical mass and we have the financial strength to capitalize on this financial opportunity. And finally, we have a long track record of converting these positive dynamics into consistently strong operating results.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Caris.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "David, just looking at the businesses, cellular and high-performance analog, can you give us a typical split-out in the businesses? And as you get traction with a number of the vertical market opportunities and as you succeed with diversifying the customer base, do you expect the relative growth rate of those businesses to change over time? More specifically, do you expect high-performance analog to accelerate relative to cellular from here?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Craig, the mix was really relatively consistent with what we've seen. Linearity today was 40% of the revenue, and handset smartphones was 60%.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. And Craig, for all the dynamics we described in our prepared comments, I would expect over time to see the more diversified elements grow faster than traditional business for Skyworks, incidentally with accretive margins.", "Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then as my follow-up, looking within the high-performance analog business, the business has good exposure to communications infrastructure. It's been a fairly muted end market, but there are signs of spending improvement in China and other areas. What are you seeing in that end market? And how does that end market impact the way you're looking at the back half of the year?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Craig. Well, we are seeing a great opportunity for the infrastructure space to pick up. It's been somewhat soft now, and there really isn't a meaningful change in our near-term guidance. But we continue to gain market share. We've noted some recent design wins with companies like Ericsson, where we've increased 3x our content on LTE base stations. We're also doing some very good work with a small cell opportunity, which we think is going to be a big driver for us, also, some attach with WiLAN. So the design win position for us actually is getting much, much better. And we're confident that the carriers are going to be spending shortly, and we're going to see some upside.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. I would add that our highest growth customers in that segment today are Huawei, followed by ZTE. But as Liam said, we don't think that market is reliable enough for the count on it in short- and mid-term growth. We're simply not factoring in any growth and hope to someday be surprised.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Harsh Kumar with Stephens.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "A quick question for you. We heard from another company that plays in the smartphone area this morning talking about negative trends. I'm curious, what was the offset in your business? In other words, what part did you see strength in if you saw weakness in 1 or 2 of the parts?", "David J. Aldrich", "We saw our strength in connectivity, broadly speaking, Wi-Fi business, our home business. We saw the early program ramps of some automotive programs and some industrial applications. So that was a nice uptick for us. Those segments in aggregate are becoming meaningful growth drivers for us now. We also saw some nice growth in emerging markets, with highly integrated systems and devices going into some of the smartphones. As you probably know or have seen in Teardown reports, we're aligned very tightly with, for example, MediaTek, with some pretty slick, highly integrated devices that are beginning to ramp. So we're seeing some uptake in the emerging markets and expect that to continue.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. And as a follow-up, very nice job on the margins, gross margins, particularly. So what's the -- in your mind, what's the single biggest driver of that number moving up?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Harsh, I mean, as we had guided, we expected and we did deliver some meaningful expansion in the third quarter. We ended at 44%. Through multiple factors, I'd say that 2 of the critical ones, is, as Dave said, we're seeing an increase in the diversified analog content in our mobile space, as well as in the other vertical markets. And that -- those all have accretive margins. And we're also see -- with the new products that were ramping across a lot of different markets, this isn't just mobile or diversified analog, we're just seeing accretive margins, and we're starting to realize a lot of benefit from our design for cost focus and the value that our customers are assigning to the differentiated performance-based solutions that we're providing. And the volume helps as well. And we're a company that continues to focus on factory performance and product cost. And it's about yields, it's about productivity, the CapEx you see us spending that has very quick paybacks. All that contributes to incremental margin performance. So it's a lot of things.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "On the guidance, it was much better, I think, some investor fears out there. Could you maybe elaborate? In some of your comments, you talked about some share gains embedded in the guidance. Can you give us some color on where you're seeing share gains relative to the overall market?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well -- I think Liam could help me with this question as well, Mike. I don't -- it's not really share gains that's driving the growth and that's driving the margin expansion. It is much more a function of -- I'd put it in this order. One is, we are gaining a lot more content as we bundle our system solution around what had been traditional analog and RF content. So you're seeing a very high attach rate with GPS, power management, Wi-Fi, in addition to switching and control and amplification. So that's a big driver for us. I would put right up there with that just penetration into new markets. We're getting high ASP with very high contribution for products that have been custom-designed into some of the vertical markets we've been talking about. You thought about energy. You think about energy management, infrastructure, but this is much broader than that now. We're seeing the Connected Home, the automobile. And these are meaningful revenue drivers with really nice margin. So I think that we're in the right place at the right time with the right chipset partners in the case of the emerging market growth, so that was also a contributor. So I wouldn't call it share gains as much as I would, just a concerted effort to diversify and to add more value to our customers. And yes, as a result, you do gain share, and you box out competitors as you raise the bar technically with these more integrated solutions. But the intent is really to service our customers with more content and a better overall system experience.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay. And just as a follow-up to that with your more integrated solution for the lower-end 3G smartphone market, upgrading from 2G in China, as you mentioned, MediaTek's reference design, is that business going again sequentially in Q3? There are some concerns of some inventory in China, but it might be with some other customers and not MediaTek. Can you comment at all about your guidance? Would the China-related business be up sequentially in that guidance?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, Mike, this is Liam. The China business, as Dave outlined earlier, is actually really moving in the right direction for us now. We've been engaged with MediaTek and Spreadtrum for quite a while. We're seeing the early stages of an upgrade cycle there where our content can go up 2 to 3x from the baseline 2G business. The other important thing about China, you still have the majority of the subscribers carrying 2G feature phones. So there's opportunity in our core business, but we're also seeing an extended reach. As you go into the smartphone world in China, you're increasingly seeing Wi-Fi for the first time. You're seeing more complexity in the Antenna Switch Modules, GPS applications and power. So as Dave said, it's share gains, but it's also a broadening reach for us. And China, for the most part, has been really slow to adopt some of those new technologies, and we're looking forward to some upside there.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "A couple of questions. Dave, last year, around this time, you -- we chatted about product mix, especially the Cellular One. And you made a prediction that turned out to be accurate, that you'd be the largest manufacturer of pads in this space. Do you still feel that's going to be the case over the next 6 months? Or do you think your makeshift is more to analog now than it has to FAS? And increasingly, SOI is becoming a very big deal in some of the leading smartphones. One of your competitors has led in that area, but it sounds like you guys are gaining a lot of ground. Where do you think that mix is going over the next say 6 to 9 months? Is Skyworks going to start showing up? Or is your presence, say, in antenna tuners that you have in the past? And then SOI, in general, so we can get some color on the CMOS SOI mix, if you could.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. Okay. I think, Ed, the first part of your question was about filters, specifically, I take it, our participation in filters. You mentioned pads and so on. So let me try to clarify that a little bit. We participate in filters when it's part of a more integrated system. A pad is a good example. SkyOne, as a product family, incorporates many of the duplexers. We can use our manufacturing techniques to do a lot of die stacking and inexpensive small footprint integration that's pretty unique, and we have some proprietary capabilities there that we're exploiting. And we are one of the largest integrator of filters in the world. I think we are the largest by unit volume today. Again, we don't sell discrete filters. That's not our business. And I expect to continue to do extremely well there. We are in a unique competitive advantage, oddly enough, because since we don't -- we're not vertically integrated or filtered, nor do we want to be. We think that's a long-term lower margin, more commoditized segment of the mobile business. However, because we are not in a filter business, we've got great relationships and strategic partnerships with a growing list of filter suppliers because we use a different filter below 2 gigahertz. We use simple SAWs that are cheap. We temperature compensate a SAW for certain applications where spectrum is very tight, and that temperature compensation improves the frequency performance. Above 2 gigahertz, we use some volt devices from a couple of different suppliers that really give us an advantage again with spectral crowding and higher frequency. So we're a really good partner for these filter suppliers because we're really their only conduit to some of these very high-volume sockets. And they view us that way, and they're opening capacity up for us. And we're doing some proprietary packaging and designs to make it sticky.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, Ed. And with respect to SOI, silicon product, we certainly have been deploying those technologies in our switching business. And when you move into high throw ASMs, which now is the prevailing approach 6 to 8, and it's up to 12 throws, carrier aggregation, as you note, is becoming a very important part of the equation now, as you stitch channel bandwidths wider and wider in upcoming smartphones. Even Wi-Fi, we've been using SOI technology broadly. So we feel real good about our position there. We have PM technology as well. And whatever the market needs, we're going to be ready to deliver.", "Operator", "We'll take a question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow back on the China business, if you could maybe just quantify, one, just about how much that was of your business in the June quarter. And then I just wanted to clarify. You clearly have an opportunity as 2G goes to 3G. I was just curious, in the near term here, your outlook for September, are you still seeing growth there? Because there definitely is a lot of concern there. I just wanted to make -- clarify that you weren't just talking about the longer-term trends there.", "David J. Aldrich", "Our China business has been running in the mid-single digits. That's been fairly consistent. And it's really been the intersection of less investment in 2G, a technology that's in decline unit volume-wise. And I think profit-wise, it's in decline. So we focused exclusively on those areas of integration where we have a competitive advantage. And I think that the market is, over the long term, going to see that it's very difficult to hit the BOM cost targets with the amount of complexity that's inherent in the smartphone, even for -- even in China. And so we've done some things that are very unique around low cost but high-performance, highly integrated. And we get good margin on those products. So it's relatively small today, though. It had hit -- it has passed the inflection point where 2G was declining faster than the uptake in 3G. And we now are seeing growth. And we saw growth this quarter. And we're ramping some new programs. And we expect to see some growth in the next quarter as well.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then I just wanted to ask you about SkyOne, if you could just update on some timing and some milestones and whether you still feel as positively there.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Blayne. Well, we've made great progress over the last quarter with SkyOne. And let me just remind you that this is really an engine that provides our customers with a unique value proposition. We're delivering a fully functional yet highly simplified solution. It is configurable, it sweeps in all the key elements of the RF chain and we do all the tuning and matching. It addresses the challenges that we've all discussed here about increasing complexity, and band count also matched with the need for power efficiency and size. So with that said, we've made great progress. We're sampling a number of customers. We continue to do that. And we actually have design wins now that we would expect to be shipping by the end of the year.", "Operator", "And our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Dave, could you address the competitive and pricing dynamics in the market? Because I think this has been a key concern about not just Skyworks but all the other vendors is that there is customer concentration risks and that pricing is likely to get more aggressive as the mix moves more towards the lower end. So can you just help set the record there as to what are the pricing dynamics? Are you seeing more pricing pressure than you have experienced before? Any color would be very helpful.", "David J. Aldrich", "I would say this year and our pricing negotiations for next year, we're seeing a little bit less pricing pressure than we saw last year. I think it's partly the mix. Remember, pricing pressure is in direct proportion to the number of competitors and how sticky a product is or how much value the product adds. And what we're increasingly finding with the products we're addressing is that we don't see multiple competitors. It's custom. It's virtually all custom. So what we're trying to do is develop a product that, from its onset, hits the customer's desired BOM point but does so in a way where we have high contribution because the product is very unique. And as subsequent generations of designs, and if you look at -- in fact, if you look at recent Teardowns, you'll see a lot more Skyworks content with devices that are fully shield, that are integrated or that are at least bundled and optimized for the ultimate system performance. You're seeing a lot more power devices, more voltage regulation devices, more connectivity devices. So Vivek, I think it's not the case that we're selling components with a bunch of competitors. We're selling system solutions with a narrow set of competitors to change as we move from market-to-market. And that's been a concerted effort on our part to migrate our business away from components and commodities, and we're being much more successful today.", "Donald W. Palette", "And Vivek, that's part of what you're seeing in the margin profile, too.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Absolutely. And then just 1 follow-up on that. As you look at the opportunities you have both in your traditional power amplifier and front-end module segment versus the high-performance analog, are you seeing better attach rate, so better attach with your high-performance analog solutions? How should we think about sort of the -- you're selling more of these complementary solutions into a bigger TAM that you had been able to do before?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Well, I mean, it's a combination. We certainly will take advantage of opportunities to bring what we would call traditional analog technology into our mobile suite, and we've done well with that. But we are seeing an increasing suite of opportunities and applications in broad markets. We've talked a lot about Smart Energy. We're also doing work now supporting connectivity and LED lighting. We're doing panel power for tablets. We've been doing work with video security. There's just a whole plethora of opportunities that we're going after with our high-performance business. Some of it uses traditional products like our 802.11ac. Some of it\u2019s more organic technology that we've grown in-house. But we're very pleased with that opportunity. And quite frankly, as much as our numbers have been strong, there's tremendous market share there that we haven't yet tapped.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think to follow on to Liam's comment, I really should stress that almost no one is buying a PA today or a switch. They're concerned with, look, I've got a number of bands that's exploding. I need to go from the output of that transceiver. I need to know what voltage and power that front-end is going to see. I need to tune it at the antenna. And I need you to shield all of this and frequency synthesize and convert it in a manner that I don't have harmonics problems and I can fit it in a physical footprint off the board. And that's very different than a model that I think you're referring to when you talk about commodity pricing. And I think if you're only selling -- for those few customers who want to buy a discrete PA and a 2G, there's too many competitors. I don't -- that's not our business focus.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "A number of the prior questions addressed some of the turbulence being seen in the end markets. I just wanted to check with you. Are you, in fact, seeing any slowdowns, adjustment downs and build plans for some of your key OEMs? Is that a factor in the outlook? Or is there somehow through mix that you're actually not seeing that? And then a follow-up on the China question. I know you addressed the longer-term opportunity for content to go up 2 to 3x. You've got the MediaTek attach, as well as the Lenovo, Huawei and ZTE wins. Are you seeing both unit volume attach and ASPs go up or content per device go up right now? Or is it more one or the other?", "David J. Aldrich", "Alex, the first part of the question, with respect to mix and slowdowns and so on, I think it's helpful to point out, that there isn't an OEM with meaningful volume today that we don't have some business with. And overall, that business is increasing in content and TAM share, if you will. We're adding more functionality. So yes, well, of course, we're not immune from any OEM who's having a difficulty. We see it. If there's another customer who's taking some of that share, we typically see it as well. And so we're more of a broad proxy in terms of the overall growth in unit volume and then we add to that incremental content and then we add to that the higher attach rate in these focused vertical markets, which are -- were coming from a relatively small position and seeing strong sequential growth for several quarters now.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. And Alex, with respect to China, you've got 2 dynamics. You have just a richer content mix in smartphones, whether they're 3G or 3G TD-SCDMA. You've got that benefit. And then you have the actual subscriber upgrade cycle going now where the majority of new subscribers are moving into that category. So you have more units of smartphone increase, and then you have a content gain in each smartphone.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "So you're seeing it be accretive to content, as well as profitability, and then also your latest thoughts on the TDD-LTE opportunity ahead of you?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, I think -- well, exactly. So we are seeing accretive for sure. And the TD-LTE opportunity for us is actually quite positive. We've been working with a number of the key players. We're also starting to talk with carriers a bit and looking for ways to do something unique, create more of that systems approach that, really, in markets like China, when you're dealing with customers like Lenovo and some of the smaller players, the benefit for us to come in and provide more systems architectural solutions really plays well. So I think that will all come together, and we have the right people on the ground to make it happen.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum Capital.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Dave, on -- or maybe, Liam, getting back to SkyOne, you're going to start shipping by the end of the year. So in addition, just to additional bands and more content in China, do you think your overall content can go up once you start launching SkyOne? And where do you think SkyOne goes, say, by the end of next year? And then lastly, is it fair to say that Wi-Fi is growing faster than your cellular side?", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Anthony. With respect to SkyOne, SkyOne is a unique product. It is, as Liam mentioned, highly configurable to region of the specific customer architectures. But it has 1 common theme, and that is it is all bands of amplification with matched to the duplexer with all the switching and frequency conversion. And so it's a pretty unique product. By definition, Anthony, when we capture those socket, we capture the entire analog front-end. There isn't anything outside of it. And then, of course, the attach rate with Wi-Fi for us is very, very high. So I think you should think of it in terms of -- the SkyOne isn't for every application. It's not for every socket. But it's a great product platform for a number of customers who are going to be able to get to market quickly, where otherwise, they simply could not deal with the complexity, even of a strong reference design. They need to take -- they need this to be shielded, dropped, have it be completely bulletproofed, and that's what SkyOne does.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Right. With respect to WiLAN, I mean, we're seeing ubiquitous attachment. Now it's an incredible market for us. We're benefiting with an 11ac rollout and a handset that's just starting, and we have great position there. We're seeing an access point opportunity that is incredible. We have MIMO technology, multiple in/multiple out. Teardown is available across the board that show the richness of that opportunity. And the need for the speed. When you think of what is available today for content to the consumer, you need 11ac technology to bring that home. So that's great. And then we're seeing Wi-Fi move into some of our home automation markets, where we see Wi-Fi for video security, set-top box with customers like Comcast and others. So Wi-Fi for us now just creates such a broad opportunity that some of it's mobile, some of it's analog, some of it's home automation. It has a pretty amazing growth rate to it.", "David J. Aldrich", "Anthony, in the public domain now, there are a couple of the early high-running ac routers, for example. And those products, we've got $5, $6, $7. We've got upwards of 10 devices, power-management devices going to multiple antennas with amplifiers and switches and filters. I mean, it is amazing how complex those devices are and how much value we can add by being out in front of ac and then to be able to do some unique things to integrate and package. That's a great business for us.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I just had a couple of questions. One is kind of a follow-on to the earlier stuff on the smartphone tablet. I'm just curious, I know it's early to discuss the December quarter, but how do you think it shapes up for that vertical for smartphone tablet? I mean, do you expect that it could be a little slower quarter if Samsung kind of follows their typical seasonal end-of-the-year kind of pattern of flush in inventory and maybe Apple reorders fall a little short? I mean, I guess, I'm curious what your process is, if you could walk us through your process for sort of evaluating or even haircutting some of your customers' forecasts.", "David J. Aldrich", "Boy. Well, the December quarter we expect to be seasonally up as it normally is. We could debate how to handicap what up means, but we expect it to be up relative to September. I think more importantly, we have good visibility for December because a number of phones and smartphones and tablets in that segment of our business, you will be seeing new platforms hitting the market. That's just the way it is at the end of a calendar year. And we like our position there a lot. So we think the market will be up in December. We think we'll be up more than the market, and we can identify those programs today.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a question on RF360. I'm just curious what's your customers -- what you've seen from your customers in terms of their reaction to that part. How do you guys look at it? And maybe, I don't know, give us any color you have on what's going to be sort of key to that part getting traction and when do you think that will be.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, that's a great question. I think that in one sense, the RF360 and Skyworks' highly integrated products, including SkyOne, are really addressing a fundamental issue that we have common to both of us, and that is that RF complexity is exploding dozens of bands. Harmonics, coexistence issues are a real issue. OEMs need to simplify all this complexity. So I completely agree with Qualcomm on that front. And there are painfully few suppliers who can do anything close to the level of integration our customers need today, which is why we're seeing the margin accretion that we're seeing in the mobile space. However, here's where we differ. Every customer is different. No one-size-fits-all. They have differences in terms of the regions they want to address, the number of bands, how they look to implement, where they see the sensitivity in the system, given what they're trying to deliver in terms of functionality. So we do not see a one-size-fits-all design approach, which is why we've made SkyOne, for example, to be highly reconfigurable, even though it's highly integrated. The other place where we differ is we do not see any customers willing to take any iota of compromise on performance, particularly with respect to current consumption. And so if you look at SkyOne, it has the very best process functionality, the very best packaging technology to deliver the best performance for each functional block within that transmit chain because we just don't see any customers willing to say, \"Well, it's not that -- the performance isn't as good, but it's highly integrated.\" Well, so what? So we see this is an area where Skyworks excels, in fact.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "My first question was just on the operating expense. If I look at what you did last quarter, what you just reported and what you've guided, you're doing a pretty good job of keeping those dollars pretty flat despite growing revenue. Can you talk a little bit how we should think about those dollars over the next several quarters? Are you going to try to keep those dollars flat there still? Or would we expect to see a little bit of growth as well?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, we just guided $81 million, which is a little bit up from where we've been running around $80 million for the prior -- several prior quarters before that. We're making some targeted R&D and field apps investments that are going to support some new growth opportunities. We think they're going to drive shareholder value. So we'll do that whenever that opportunity presents itself. So you're going to see some increases as we move forward. There's pay increase maybe mid-fiscal period for us that does move OpEx a little bit. So I would think about that you can ramp that so that we're at that kind of $84 million level by the end of 2014. That's kind of a good way to think about it.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just to go a little bit into the diversification story. I think in the past, one item you've talked about is your partner with Texas Instruments on some smart meters. I think those guys do a pretty good job in that market as does somebody like Maxim. And overall, that looks like it's going to grow pretty nicely. Would you say that's going to be a significant driver for you? Or is that even the wrong way to think about it? There are so many of the things out there like smart meters that over the next 18 months, there's not going to be 1 or 2 big diversification platforms for a whole bunch of them.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. I think there will be many platforms. We do work with TI on some ZigBee sockets. There's also silicon labs and some others that we work with there. So that business is great. We've been in that market for quite a while, doing a lot of work with Itron and Sensus, Landis+Gyr, Silver Spring Networks in the Bay Area. But what's equally exciting now is this proliferation of what we call home automation where the unit count goes way up. We've got, as I said earlier, opportunities to connect lighting, to connect appliances, to connect security systems. And the unit count there is much higher than it would be just with a meter communicating back to the utility. So the good news for us is that we have the technology to play. We have the ZigBee technology, we have the Wi-Fi technology, the switching and systems capability to deliver the solution as the customers may see. But back to the opening comments about 50 billion connected things, however that number goes, it's going to get much higher, and the ability to connect is going to be there. And Skyworks has the right to policy. So we're very -- we're excited about it and look forward to updating you over the next couple of quarters.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And I just want to ask a question on the China market. I know you said your content is going up. You have good partnership with Spreadtrum, MediaTek. How do you see your share overall as you move to these higher content 3G margin and TDs picking up there?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. So markets moving up, one of the important points is that the competitive landscape is narrowing. The 2G market, we've been a player there for years, still do some work. But the landscape there is somewhat commoditized by the simplicity of the products. When you're moving to the next generation, whether it's the quad-core MediaTek design or some of the new TD-SCDMA devices out of Spreadtrum, there's a great deal more complexity, there's more energy around efficiency in the design. There are smartphones now, so they're driving more current. And our ability to kind of flex our engineering muscle and to lever our differentiated products goes up as these phones launch. So we think it's a better field for us to play on. Margins should be better, and content will continue to grow.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I know you mentioned in your press remarks that second half '13 should be pretty strong. You're diversified very well. How do you see -- as you look out into December -- I know it's a little far out, but given that you're diversified and there's a little bit of a SKU in builds, do you see strength continuing into the -- continuing out?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, we do. My expectation is that December, we'll have -- be seasonally high. It always is. We're not trying to handicap what that number is. But we've got some strong program ramps, some content gains and some verticals that are ramping going into the December quarter. So we expect to outperform whatever that seasonal number is.", "Operator", "And we go next to Mike Burton with Brean Capital.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "On the gross margins, you mentioned that mix played a role, but obviously, given your guidance for contribution margins, you expect more upside. I was just wondering, what is driving that going forward? Is it all mix? Or are there other opportunities on increasing utilization and cost reduction? And should we get a new update on the mid-term model for a target?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, as I said, Mike, that it's a combination of factors. It's the increased diversified analog content. It's better margins on products, new products that we're ramping. And we're seeing the benefit of the differentiated performance that we're providing with the customers, as well as the cost focus. Volume always helps, and it's driving improvements across all the metrics. And, in fact, it's all those things that are driving margin expansion. And we've said to use off of this new forecast we just provided you, which is 44.25%, is to drop the incremental revenue in your models through at 48%. And what that gets you when you look at the 30% model we had originally targeted around $550 million, that drops that number down to a slightly lower revenue level when you do that.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And then also, just 10% customers in the quarter.", "Donald W. Palette", "Foxconn and Samsung.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Maybe another content question for you. So in the past, you've talked about how the high-end smartphone has a total addressable market of somewhere between $10 to $12 per phone. I'm curious what your view is of kind of the low- to mid-range smartphone at this point.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, it depends. I think the upgrade cycle from 2G to 3G, particularly in China, is going to take a lot of different forms. It will be ultimate very high-end smartphones, and they'll have similar content. I think there won't be that many of those, frankly, because I think a lot of the upgrade will be more regional or be TD-LTE and bypass some of the bands. I think they need to do that to hit those -- what the market price will bear from a price point standpoint. So I think it's anywhere from a few dollars to several dollars, and that's a -- it's a big uptake obviously from the $0.50 in 2G, but that's where I kind of see it, a few dollars. It's not the $10 or $12, at least not for very many phones.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then when you look at the adoption of the highly integrated products, does that impact revenue even though it gives you higher margin?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, it impacts revenue because we, by definition, capture more content. Yes.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Back to this Internet of Things, it sounds like a potential big opportunity, lots of units but lower content. So any sense of when that could become potentially 10% of revenues? What would have to happen for that to occur? And then what sort of content do you have? Is it mostly like ZigBee or analog, et cetera?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, it's not -- the Internet of Things, it\u2019s not one thing. We kind of -- we're talking about the Connected Home and all the various forms that connectivity is taking in automobiles and other applications. And I'm not sure -- maybe I don't understand the question. It's well over 10% today if you look at what the Internet of Things means to us. It's huge.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. I think in the -- yes, in the unaddressable -- on the markets that we haven't yet addressed, let me put it that way, there's a lot of upside. So we're just starting to tackle markets like medical and home automation and tackle markets like automotive. And we're actually very surprised -- pleasantly surprised with the opportunity that we see as many of these markets move to connectivity. Telematics and automotive, for example, really wasn't a market 2, 3 years ago, and we're addressing that. We're doing home monitoring and medical. So there's a number of things that we're now going after and seeing kind of a convergence to wireless that we can take advantage of, and we haven't done it yet. It's just early innings.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "But like a ZigBee connection would be like a sub-dollar type of content then?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Some of our ZigBee connections are more than sub-dollar. It depends on where you are. When you tend to be -- if you're at the meter, for example, there's higher-end product than you are if you're in an LED light. So it can vary depending on the opportunity.", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And then my follow-up, just a couple of housekeeping questions, 2G versus non-2G percent of sales. And then how should we model net OI&E going forward? It's moved around a bit in the past few quarters.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, the 2G is 15% in the quarter, and so the 3G, 4G was 85%. I'm sorry, repeat the second question again?", "Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Net OI&E, it's moved around a bit the past several quarters. Just wanted to get some sense of how to model that going forward.", "Donald W. Palette", "I would use the $200,000 expense. Every once in a while, we'll get some impact from currency, but it's minimal for us. That's the right thing to do.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to James Faucette with Pacific Crest.", "James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a few follow-up questions here. First, you've talked a little bit about ultimately high-performance analog growing faster than cellular, but yet the proportion seems to remain relatively stable at least over the last few quarters. How should we think about timing to when we'll start to see that faster growth manifest?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, James, it's hard to say, to handicap it because there are an awful lot of high-performance analog devices in our mobile products. So, for example, take a look at a Teardown report of a phone today, of a smartphone, and there's a number of them out there, we have several dollars of content that has nothing to do with kind of a PA switch sort of a thing. So it's really hard and in some ways not quite as relevant, right, because if it's high-performance analog into tablet, so be it, right, or in a smartphone. So...", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, we're just scoring it.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. So I think it will -- over time, it will continue to trend faster and higher. But the distinction -- when we talk about the connectivity of things, the distinction between that which is a mobile device and that which is not is getting increasingly hard to do because the challenges are the same and the products are quite similar.", "James E. Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Right, absolutely. I guess, just for future reference, we're looking at it from the standpoint of, hey, those particularly high-performance analogs, they tend to go into longer-life cycle products and ultimately drive better margin contribution, in general.", "David J. Aldrich", "That's true. Good point. That's true. So it will trend higher over time, but it won't be a big needle or a curve. We think it'll be graceful.", "Liam K. Griffin", "And certainly, James, we have a lot of headroom there. I think we're doing very well in mobile, and we're bringing analog into mobile, of course. But there's a lot of work and opportunity in front of us where we can bring accretive margins in with our high-performance analog in the markets that we talked about before, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's automotive markets that typically have the 50-point-plus GMs.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a quick clarification first on the China business. Will you talk about China's mid-single digits? Does that include the branded players like Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo? Or was that really more of a reflection on the white box percentage?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think it's more a reflection on the white box percentage. We're seeing -- we have a lot of business now with Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE. So I think it's more of the sort of the open market stuff.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just trying to get a sense on the September quarter guide. You talked one of the drivers being program ramps. I'm wondering, can you make any comments about how diversified the growth is in the September quarter? Or is it more concentrated to a couple of larger program ramps in the quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "Quinn, I'm glad you asked that question because what I'm really thrilled about is that if I look at this quarter, if I look at September, it is very diversified. It's diversified in the sense that it's a diverse set of customers. It's diversified in the sense that those existing customers are buying more content from us across the board, Quinn, across the board. And I really like the work that our high-performance analog teams have done with these teams focused on specific verticals and what they've been able to undercover in terms of underserved opportunities for us. Sometimes it's manufacturing integration, often, it's the intersection of manufacturing with high-performance devices with a newly connected market -- existing market that becomes newly connected. And so I am thrilled with the degree of diversification that we're rolling out in September, and you see it in the margins.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that's going to conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, everyone, for participating, and I look forward to seeing you in upcoming conferences.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our conference call for today.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' fourth fiscal quarter 2013 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin.

We'll then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we'll discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a strong close to the 2013 fiscal year, with fourth quarter results beating our prior expectations on the top and bottom line. Our out performance was driven by our expanding diversified analog footprint and growth in custom solutions for connectivity platforms coupled with a laser focus on execution.", "During the fourth quarter, we posted revenue of $477 million. That's up 9%, sequentially, and more than 13% versus last year. We produced operating income of $130 million, that's up 26% versus last year. We earned $0.64 in diluted earnings per share, up more than 20% versus last year and $0.02 ahead of our guidance. We also generated $166 million in cash flow from operations.", "Our strong fourth quarter performance closed out a record 2013 for Skyworks. To recap, for the full year, we posted over 14% top line growth, achieving revenue of nearly $1.8 billion. We grew our operating income by 19%, exiting the fiscal year with operating margins of 27%. And we generated over $0.5 billion in cash flow from operations. We also repurchased over 8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $22.75 per share.", "The growth, profitability and cash flow metrics that we achieved in 2013 put us among the best-of-breed within our broader peer group and highlight our differentiated business model.", "Looking ahead, we see this momentum continuing. Our strategy of aggressively investing in diversified analog markets, while capturing more value through custom system solutions will enable us to continue to drive above market -- above market top line growth, profit margin expansion, strong earnings leverage and robust cash flow.", "For more detailed commentary on the quarter, I'll now turn it over to Don for his financial review and outlook.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining us, everyone. We appreciate that. I'm going to provide a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter results and then outline our business outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2014.", "Revenue for the fourth quarter was $477 million, and that's up over 9% sequentially, and more than 13% year-over-year. Gross profit was $211.8 million or 44.4% of revenue, ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range and up 150 basis points from a year ago.", "Operating expenses were $81.5 million, consisting of R&D expense of $49.2 million and SG&A expense of $32.3 million. Operating income was $130.3 million for the quarter. That translates into 27.3% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 7.3%, slightly better than our prior forecast based on favorable year-end tax adjustments.", "Net income was $121.2 million or $0.64 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.02 better than our guidance.", "Turning to the fourth quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $166 million in cash flow from operations, we invested $38 million in capital expenditures, with depreciation of $19 million, exited the fiscal year with $511 million in cash and no debt. And we repurchased over 800,000 shares of our common stock. For the full fiscal year, we produced $508 million in cash flow from operations, with free cash flow of $384 million. That represents over 8% free cash flow yield based on our most recent stock price. Finally, our return on invested capital was 20.5% for fiscal 2013, well ahead of our weighted average cost of capital.", "Turning to our first quarter 2014 business outlook. We expect Q1 revenue to be $500 million, our first quarter as a company at a $2 billion annualized revenue run rate. We expect gross margins to continue trending higher and recommend modeling at 48% drop-through of incremental revenue to the gross profit line. That translates in the first quarter gross margin of around 44.5%. We expect operating expenses to be approximately $82.5 million, resulting in operating margins of 28%, and that's a 270-basis-point improvement from Q1 of 2013.", "Over the course of fiscal 2014, we expect continued margin enhancement driven by growth of our diversified analog business and by capturing new customized content across the world's leading connectivity platforms.", "All the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expense from interest income and other expenses, and a cash tax rate around 10%. We expect our cash tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of 2014 fiscal year. As a result, we expect Q1 EPS of $0.66 using a base of 191 million shares. Many of the drivers for a strong 2014 are in place today, giving us a high level of confidence in our growth trajectory over the course of the year and putting us on a clear path to achieving our midterm business model of 30% operating margins at a quarterly revenue level of $550 million. And just as a reminder, this would produce around $3 in annualized earnings per share.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on our market trends and growth strategy.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Don. We're quite pleased by our recent financial performance. And more importantly, we're excited about 2014 and beyond. Our consistently strong business results reflect the healthy underlying trends in our served market and our success in capitalizing on these opportunities. These include the widespread adoption of connectivity in all its forms across a diverse set of end markets. The dramatic increase in analog complexity driven by the proliferation of communication protocols and enhanced functionality, and OEMs need to align with partners capable of providing a total system solution that maximizes performance.", "So for the remainder of the call, I'll discuss how our business strategy is designed to capitalize on these trends, generating above market growth with best-in-class financial returns.", "At a high level, there are 2 underlying components to our strategic plan. First, we're aggressively investing in growth opportunities across diversified analog end markets. And second, we are capturing more value to highly customized system solutions. The end result is that Skyworks facilitates the adoption of all forms of connectivity within devices, across the supporting infrastructure and throughout the broad markets. Starting with the broader market opportunity, it is clear that connectivity has evolved into a critical enabling technology within the traditional analog landscape, and in fact, represents the biggest growth vector in these markets today. Just as an example, General Electric recently announced that it will incorporate Machine-to-Machine communications across its entire industrial portfolio, including jet engines, including locomotives, turbines and medical devices, representing millions of GE products in total. This is just one example of how traditional analog end markets like industrial, medical, automotive are embracing connectivity. In many cases, for the first time and intersecting directly with Skyworks' core competencies, these are highly attractive markets for us, characterized by longer product life cycles, far fewer competitors and higher margins. Skyworks participates in these markets by leveraging core analog and mixed signal design capabilities and a very broad product catalog.", "Our portfolio spans all connectivity standards and includes power management ICs, panel lighting and display modules and switching solutions, along with more traditional analog products. This opportunity creates -- the opportunity that this creates is tremendous. And for example, Cisco forecasted there will be 50 billion connected devices by 2020. In fact, we recorded a number of new design wins during the quarter that illustrate our growing diversification in areas like medical. This is a newer market for Skyworks, relatively small in size for us today, but it is representing a significant growth driver in the coming years. We build the presence in this market through investment in product line expansion and field applications engineering teams and systems development. And for example, in the fourth quarter, we won a custom optical emitter detector module with Varian Medical for oncology radiation applications. We've also been designed into Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI applications, where we provide switch matrices for reactors and limited diodes -- limiter diodes, utilizing literally dozens of Skyworks devices.", "In total, we provide a portfolio of the analog solutions for a wide range of medical applications like hearing aids and glucose monitors, heart defibrillators and patient telemetry applications. And we're already aligned with the major medical equipment makers like GE Medical, Boston Scientific and Medtronic, among others. Our Q4 design wins also include a diverse set of applications like DC/DC convertors and LED backlight drivers for automotive displays at LG. Like power management ICs and ZigBee Front Ends for WNC's portfolio of remote lighting, in-home monitoring security platforms. Low noise amplifiers for the broadcast microphone portfolio at Shure. Hi-rel analog solutions with Cobham, EADS and Teledyne and low-power Smart Energy solutions supporting communications hubs, meters and in-home displays with Silicon Labs.", "In summary, we're quite excited about the breadth of new market opportunities that deploy Skyworks' technology.", "Turning to the second component of our growth strategy, we are capturing more value through highly customized system solutions. Growth of connected devices is projected to continue at a healthy pace for the next several years, but more importantly, Skyworks' addressable content is being driven higher. By the adoption of precision location-based services and upgraded local area connectivity, both of which require highly customized isolation and shielding to avoid coexistent issues with adjacent communication protocols. High-performance power management ASICs and LCD backlighting to support higher resolution displays and more complex camera flash approaches. System-level architectural trends like tuning, carrier aggregation and diversity to maximize data bandwidth within today's spectrum constraints, and brand proliferation with significant expansion in global 4G, LTE capabilities. The net result is an expanding addressable market opportunity for Skyworks. And in fact, it's not uncommon for us today to target addressable content of more than $12 within leading platforms. This is more than twice that of just a few years ago, and we see numerous opportunities to continue adding new content in the coming years.", "So in closing, our force -- our fourth fiscal quarter marked another strong performance for Skyworks, and we are optimistic about our prospects for 2014. Our strategy of growing our diversified analog footprint, while capturing more value through custom system solutions will enable us to continue producing best-in-class results.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, let's open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Stephens.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. First of all, in your business highlight section of the press release, there was not a single cellphone design win. So when you talk of diversity, Dave, are you talking about diversity of revenues into analog, or more specifically, diversity of revenues into analog away from cellphones?", "David J. Aldrich", "No, Harsh. Thank you. It's not away from cellphones. It's more the fact that the smartphone market, tablets and the like, they're very large components and drivers of a broader connectivity landscape. So when we talk about connectivity, we talk about location-based services for example, Wi-Fi connectivity, power management and expanding our footprint. We're talking about mobile as well as the Connected Home, as well as medical application, the automobile, Machine-to-Machine. So we're really talking about connectivity in a more broad sense.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, could you, Dave, maybe talk about your assumptions for the China market in the near-term and even the Korean market on the large customer there? There's been a lot of talk that there's variations going on in the order activity. Any color that you can give us would be helpful.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Harsh, this is Liam. With respect to China, we have a very strong position there as we've had in the past, with all the major players, MediaTek, Spreadtrum. We've seeing great opportunity going into 2014 and beyond, as they move through an upgrade cycle that's really is in the early innings. As you know, probably 80% of the subscribers today in China are carrying a 2G phone. MediaTek for example, moving from dual- to quad-core chipsets. Supporting customers like Lenovo and CoolPad and others, great partnership for us. And I think, one of the opportunities you should see is not only an expansion in our core power amplifier and multi-band, but also will start to weave in Wi-Fi and power management, GPS and other capabilities around analog. So that should be a growth for us. And with respect to Korea, we have seen in some cases, some inventory correction there, but it's all been factored into our guidance. Nothing that surprises us, and nothing that will impact our numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley from Canaccord.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Don, just a quick housekeeping question. Can you just give us a split between the handset and HPA business, and then I have a follow-up question.", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure, Mike, it's consistent where we've been [indiscernible] it's 40% HPA and partially 60% handset.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Great. And if we just look longer term, we're a big believer also in the Internet of Everything and Machine-to-Machine market. But with the opportunities you highlighted, and the growing band LTE et cetera. Over the next year or 2, it seems like the TAM of just of handset side of your business grows to double-digits, so do you anticipate the next staying similar for you 2 businesses over time?", "David J. Aldrich", "This is Dave, Mike. No, I don't. I think that the non-handset component of our business will grow and become a larger component than the 40% that it is today, because we talked about medical in the prepared comments. It's a relatively nascent market in terms of connectivity, but the opportunities are exploding, Machine-to-Machine. So I think, the year-over-year growth rates in connectivity into some of these newer burgeoning markets is going to grow -- allow us to grow faster. You're right. Within mobile, what we're really seeing is not so much of the growth coming from traditional products, but being able to provide more custom system solutions and incorporate power management location-based services, like Wi-Fi connectivity and lighting and display. So we done a -- we think a good job of adding more content growing that way within mobile -- it's highly defensible, it's higher margin and then continuing to round out our market portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Dave, how's the visibility into the flagship models for 2014? So if you, for example, look at the top 3, 4, 5 models that you're in today, would you expect your content to be flat, up or down next year? Any color would be helpful.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I think, Vivek, if I could answer that question more broadly, there is a trend that is not slowing down and that is -- these devices in general, high-end smartphones as well as the upgrade cycle from 2Gs feature phones to smartphones in places like China, is sweeping in much more content and complexity, the screens are becoming, in many cases bigger, but in all cases a higher resolution, the cameras are moving to do full-flash AMOLED technologies. You're starting to see more complex power management and voltage regulations systems required to support low-current consumption. Connectivity with GPS and Wi-Fi being virtually across the board, so I think in general, you should look at the content gains for a broad analog provider like Skyworks, continuing for many years to come. I don't see that slowing down. And then, I think, as you start to see connectivity in its nascent state moving into these other markets, you'll start to see a shift towards a more balanced portfolio of end markets for Skyworks, in addition to a much broader set of functions, customized into a system solution. It's sticky, it's defensible, and we make much higher margin in those class of products.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I see. And as a follow-up, Dave, I always very surprised to look at the growth rate you guys have delivered versus the discount that your stock sells at versus say, TriQuint or Avago, presumably, one of the factors is that those guys have access to broad FBAR filters, and you perhaps do not. I'm wondering, are you being, I don't know if handicap is the right word, but are you being held back in any way in going after certain sockets or do you think you might undergo their growth rates because you don't have access to broad FBAR filter capability?", "David J. Aldrich", "Vivek, that's the first time I've heard the question asked quite that way. I feel absolutely not. Filters has not been an impediment. If you look at closely at tear down reports of those platforms that use filters integrated with other devices, I think, we're the largest. We produce many, many filters, and we participate broadly, and I think our model is quite unique. We don't sell discrete filters, and I think, that's a big advantage for us. We like the margin structure of more highly customized solutions and integrated solutions. And what we're able to do in SkyOne and PADs and our GPS modules is we're able to couple the very best process with the frequency or with the application. For example, below 2 GHz, if you look at those tear down reports, if you look at our product portfolio below 2 GHz, we use surface acoustic devices and when its spacing is narrow, the frequency spectrum spacing is narrow, we use temp comp saw[ph] devices from a different supplier. Above 2 GHz, in some cases when there is narrow spacing, we'll use a bulk device. As we have strategic partners that are giving us a very good pricing with quite differentiated solutions in each one of those technology nodes. So, no, it's not in the least bit hampering our growth in the margin structures for those products are quite good.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "One last one, if I can squeeze it. If you look at the non-handset market, I would assume that it would be able to grow faster for you guys in the handset market because those are new under-penetrated markets. So if you could address that? And is it fair to assume that those are more profitable markets for you?", "David J. Aldrich", "It is, as I mentioned earlier, we expect a ratio of 60-40 to swing over time. More growth in these markets for the very reason you've highlighted. They're nascent adopters of connectivity but the growth rate, sequentially, we expect to be very strong. And because of our very broad system portfolio, we are able to address it. In those cases, many of these customers are not proficient at all in connectivity, and in wireless and we're able to land a complete solution that make it very easy for them to get to market. So we expect to grow very fast there.", "Donald W. Palette", "And almost all of those are accretive as far as the return standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company.", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "But my first question, Dave, is are you guys broadcasting from the side of the Analyst Day?", "David J. Aldrich", "I'm sorry, say that again?", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Are you guys broadcasting tonight's call from [indiscernible]...", "David J. Aldrich", "No, unfortunately, we're not. We're here in the dark conference room in Woburn, Massachusetts. I wish we were though.", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Sorry. I just had to ask. On a serious note, just a quick question, you talked in some of the prepared comments about the mix shift of some of that opportunities in analog, and I'm just wondering, within HPA, can you give us a sense what percent of HPA is in sort of the non-mobile device segment? is that may be the half of HPA and does it -- it sounds like the non-mobile side of HPA, probably used a faster growing part of business over a long period of time. If that's the case, do you think ultimately you can drive to a better than 47% incremental margin as you see that mix shift kick in?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I think it is definitely much more in the non-mobile than it is in the mobile. And I think what you're referring to, Quinn, must be that, we have Wi-Fi solutions that we sell broadly and everywhere. And some of those solutions do, in fact, go into smartphones and tablets. But I think broadly speaking, again, we expect the non-mobile piece of our business to grow more quickly over time than the mobile piece. They are accretive to margin. And it will over the long haul continue to see -- help us improve our returns. And in fact, as Don talked about in the prepared remarks, this quarter we guided to about 28 points. Although in the midterm we see 30 points at $550 million of revenue a quarter. We're $500 million now. And that's a function of diversification within custom analog solutions in mobile, outside of mobile and our entry into new markets.", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Then just a quick follow-up on the PA side. Qualcomm's out with RF360. It looks like Peregrine Semiconductor just announced the new SOI-based process that they could integrate PAs and switches. Are you guys looking at silicon germanium as a platform for integration? Or are you seeing pretty good demand for modules like SkyOne and don't necessarily see silicon germanium is the right integration platform?", "David J. Aldrich", "It's interesting. The answer is yes to both. We see SkyOne. In fact, we have our first 2 customers who are ramping production now. So you'll be able to buy 2 different high-end phone -- or high-volume phone models this year. We're excited about that. We have other customers coming online. So it's a great sort of highly integrated and also high-performance solution. It by the way contains SOI content, silicon content, as well as other process technology. Again, focusing on the right process for the function and integrating it in a very inexpensive way using our proprietary manufacturing techniques. We probably ship -- in our connectivity markets alone, we ship over 100 million SOI and silicon germanium devices a quarter. So I think we're probably the biggest procurer of SOI wafers. And we ship more than anybody, I think, in the market today. I believe that's right. So we're quite agnostic. We will ship SOI, silicon germanium. We will ship HBT. And we will ship pure bulk CMOS. Again, focusing on what's the best process for the function where we will have a fair and a high return, and we can provide the appropriate level of integration for the customer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Good numbers here. I had a question on the gross margin line again. How much room do you have there? Obviously, it has come up very nicely and you're well above your peers. How much room do you have there as you look at fiscal '14? And what are the levers there to improve that?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Vijay, this is Don. I mean, the best way to do that is the way we've been talking about modeling it. I would continue to use the 48% incremental margin on all the increased revenue contribution, and that's -- the underlying assumption is, when Dave talked about 30% at $550 million. So take the latest guidance and drop that incremental revenue through at 48%, and you'll see the margin expansion opportunity. But then the real opportunity longer term -- that's short term -- longer term is, as we continue to provide more and more of these complex systems solutions and move towards more and more analog, we would expect that contribution to increase over time. But for '14, that's not the way to model it.", "David J. Aldrich", "And Vijay, I'd add to Don's comment. You've asked the question in an interesting way. You said our gross margin is above our peers. I don't look at it that way. I think our gross margin today is below our peers. Our operating income is in line with the best among the diversified analog companies. But if you look at companies who are in power management, voltage system solutions around analog mixed signals, their gross margins are higher than ours. And that's where we aspire. I think when you talk about our peers, we don't compare ourselves to traditional PA-like companies, we compare ourselves to highly-diversified, well-run analog companies.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Good to have high aspirations there. Going on to the Qualcomm RF360, are you seeing that in the market? I mean, is there -- how do you see -- do you see that taking away from the RF market next year with some of those integrated solutions there?", "David J. Aldrich", "You know the short answer to that today is no. And the reason for that is, the vast majority of our OEM customers continue to look for custom solutions with very high performance requirements. And they raise that bar with every new model. I suppose there could be and will be a narrow market with less stringent performance requirements that would utilize a pre-configured system in a package. But even in this segment, we tend to win with configurations like SkyOne, different approaches to MMMB technology, PADs and so on, that are more configurable with a very low cost structure. So in short, we see no impact to our business model and don't see it for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Great. Just following-up, you guys had a very nice performance here and guidance. And I was just wondering if -- given that if you could talk a little bit about your cycle times and how you go to market with your customers given your record of performance here. Do you think you're able to, say, hold less inventory and able to deliver it more quickly? So part of the question is, how quickly or how soon ahead of when your customer's product ramp are you able to ship? And do you think that's better than maybe what your peers are doing that leads you to give some better performance and better guidance?", "David J. Aldrich", "Our inventory turns right now are pushing 5, we think that's good. We can do better over the long haul. We have aspirations to just continue to reduce our cycle times to increase those turns. That's an aspiration we have across the balance sheet. Our cycle times range from a few weeks in processes in which we're vertically integrated to a couple of months where we have to go out and buy things like CMOS controllers and SOI devices. So I think we have -- and we're able to because we do our own assembly and test. And we think we're pretty fast on our feet. I do think we have a cycle time advantage vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis our competition, and we don't see any issue intersecting with our customer ramps or supporting those ramps based on cycle time.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the gross margin and your point about seeing the analog guys more as your peers for gross margin. Is it fair to say that as technology evolves here that it's a more full featured SkyOne solution, et cetera, that would allow you to get to that gross margin that you're talking about? Or could you still do it even if you had like, say, a one-off PA for, say, an LTE phone is -- given cost improvements or whatever, could you potentially get to maybe a 50% gross margin or something just on a PA?", "David J. Aldrich", "Steve, I think I'd look at it this way. The standalone PA is becoming increasingly a smaller percentage of our business. It's not what is driving the long-term return and growth of the market. When we look at mobile, we look at mobility in terms of a smartphone. We really think that the customer base is becoming less interested in differentiating at the chipset level and looking for companies that are broad, that are smart, that can ramp quickly and support future cost structures that will enable high usage. And there aren't many companies who could do that. So we increasingly don't sell components. We don't want to promote the component business because it's too easy to create competition among the OEMs. So what we do is, we focus on customization. We have, for example, in location GPS modules that we're selling by the hundreds of millions right now, and those GPS modules are fully shield and filtered. It's patented. It's proprietary processes using our own manufacturing. And no one else can do it. And we get paid a premium for it. The Wi-Fi upgrade to AC using SOI and SIGI [ph] and other technologies and our own packaging gives us a differential performance advantage. When we do SkyOne, it's kind of the ultimate because we give them everything from the output of the transceiver to the antenna and everything in between, and it's completely custom. It's all ours. And we don't compete with anybody for components. So it's not a PA business. It's a system solution business that is mixed signal and analog. It is mobile to the sense that there are a lot of smartphones sold, but is increasingly markets that are growing into connectivity in this overall fabric called broad market connectivity, where we think we're broader. We think we have the scale. We know we have the customer relationships. And that's where our growth in margin and revenue is going to come from over the next many years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Maybe if you could just talk about, I mean, obviously, I probably should start with the nice guidance. And I would say, some of your peers have talked about corrections at some of the smartphone vendors. If you could just talk about broadly the space, and you, obviously, are offsetting that. But are you seeing any end-of-the-year corrections as many else have?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, Blayne, this is Liam. We noted earlier on a prior question that there was a little bit of a correction in Korea. We had visibility to that. It's completely factored into our guidance. And with that account, I should add that we're doing quite well on new product upgrades in the next cycle of smartphones there. So it really isn't anything to be concerned with. We understand it. We recognize it. But it's been fully monetized into our numbers.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. And then you probably don't want to guide -- talk too much about Q1, I mean, some of your peers have talked about a more normal pattern in Q1, down double digits. If you can maybe talk about whether there's any factors that would be offsetting of any sort of normal trend, and what you consider a normal trend into Q1?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I think -- in fact, Blayne, if you go back and look at the last few years, it's obviously a little too early to give specifics about March. It's normally a seasonally down quarter. It will be that way probably this year. But this trend that we're seeing with these new products from Skyworks that are solving some unique difficult problems our OEMs are facing. We're getting them get designed in now, and they're going into production this quarter, next quarter and quarters beyond. So we're seeing an uptake in SkyOne. We're seeing an uptake in a number of different power-based devices and lighting devices, both within mobile and outside of mobile. So I think like prior years, we expect to do better and -- to do substantially better than what would be a normally seasonally down quarter.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then if I can just get one more. I apologize -- there's a couple of calls tonight -- if you already answered this. But the prior answer to SkyOne was, you had parts but there hasn't been a lot of uptick. But has something changed and that you're seeing a more meaningful uptick there?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, we have 2 customers that have gone through type approval. They're ramping now. And there'll be phones available in late November, December. And we have more to follow.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Dave, a couple of questions. First, what do you think your blend is, GaAs versus everything else? And by that I mean, in all its implementations, both in your analog business and then also in cellular? And then, kind of a similar approach, other technologies like SOI, particularly in cellular. It's clear that a lot of the bigger handset guys are moving -- I don't want to say more and more away from GaAs because it's still the core technology -- but certainly, other technologies are playing a bigger role in leading with these other OEMs. I'm just kind of curious of how that mix is working for you guys right now.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I think your basic question is correct. We're seeing, yes, this hybrid model, this fab-light model works really well for us now because we have been scaling up SOI, scaling up CMOS, scaling up other process nodes and technology. And we've been working on those for years. While at the same time, GaAs is an important enabler for certain high-performance applications for the output, transmit -- the output stage of the PA, for example, in most applications, but we're seeing a much bigger and faster growth in CMOS and silicon. To this point, I think we're much less than 1/2 on a device-by-device level, much less than 1/2 gallium arsenide than we are silicon as broadly defined.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Great. And then last year, you were kind of punished because expectations got out of hand for this time with a big new product launch. It sure seems it's been going on much better. And it's no secret, I mean, you haven't had the problem that your peers had with a really lopsided -- this kind of allocation of revenue between the 2 quarters, September and December. Is that one, just that you have a higher module content than most of your competitors, so that you're spread over evenly, I think, which hurt maybe last year? Or how much leverage, not leverage, but how much control do you have in terms of how you stack up your shipments or just manage it tighter than them? I'm trying to figure out how you came off so much better than your peers in a quarter that was heavily skewed for just about everybody.", "David J. Aldrich", "We have no control over how we skew shipments. We ship to our customers demand. In effect, we run 99% on delivery the customer requests. So we have no visibility. We have [indiscernible] and much of our revenue comes through [indiscernible] and there is no flexibility there whatsoever. So I think it's more about the diversified nature of our business even though you see some OEMs in a quarter that don't do as well as others. We tend to be shipping to all of them. We do manage our turns very closely so that we have short cycle times, and we're able to ramp up and down quickly.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, and one other comment I think that we've noted throughout the discussion today is that, again, it's not just the power amplifier and the traditional multimode, multiband devices. It's an uptake in what we call our mobile analog, where we're delivering all those technologies that Dave mentioned, Wi-Fi, very, very intense switch applications, now we add ASM, antennas healing, seeing a substantial increase in those devices that wrap around that core in power amplifier.", "Donald W. Palette", "And that's across all OEMs. I mean, that's the power of the increase, too.", "David J. Aldrich", "Exactly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Burton from Brean Capital.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Don, first on OpEx, great job there. Sticking to your word and keeping that flat. Can you help us heading into next year, what are some of the factors that may move that number around, for example, the merit increases or just running the top line will demand a greater R&D investment?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. We've been pretty consistent about when you're modeling that you might see -- expect maybe about $1 million a quarter, and that's kind of what you're seeing with the guidance in this last quarter, a little bit above that. Midyear, midyear for us is starting in the June quarter. We do have a merit increase and a significant amount of OpEx is labor. So that will affect that. And we're making targeted investments, both in R&D and our marketing and sales field apps. So for these investments are, in our minds, going to pay -- contribute a lot of shareholder value down to return because it's going to allow us to position our product portfolio to gain share. So we view these as very critical. So by the end of the year, and that's the calendar year, you could expect an OpEx level of maybe about $85 million. And we -- that's pretty consistent with what we've been saying.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then, so still -- we're still unaware of any adoption of the complete RF360 solution yet, but Qualcomm is now shipping its envelope tracker. So some of your competitors are saying that they have an advantage getting some of these early sockets with some of their own systems expertise that they're bringing in. Can you point us to any design wins that are coming right now where your PAs are being used with Qualcomm's or a competitor's tracker?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure, yes. I mean, there's really a broad list of opportunities that we've won, and we'll be going into production that utilize envelope tracking. In many cases, what we're seeing is the tracker is not -- the power amplifier comes in separately. The tracker is integrated with the baseband and the SoC. So that's not an issue. We're seeing that in some of the smartphones that are in production now this quarter. And if you go out into 2014, more and more wins for us. And I should also say that in the interim, you are also seeing APT, average power tracking, as an enabler for efficiency. We have very high share with that. And that's with Qualcomm and with others.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D. A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just another margin question for you here. Your 48% incremental gross margin is very clear. Sounds like that goes up over time as the non-handset business starts to ramp. I'm curious though, on the operating expense side, when you go to more diversified customers, is there going to be a long-term effect on the operating expense with sales and marketing that we need to think about?", "Donald W. Palette", "No, not any long-term step function change. I think that's kind of the way you're thinking about it. We still think it's very manageable. And the key to us is, all along we've talked about this, we are going to make some targeted investment, but there's a tremendous amount of leverage, and we don't see that going away in the model. So as we add revenue, it's not linear, so that's going to be a key component for us to drive to 30% and beyond as far as our income return.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. That sounds good. And then just quickly on the tax rate. You talked about just a modest cash tax rate for this year, '14. Longer term, is there kind of a peak cash tax rate we need to start thinking about?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, it's really difficult to do that. Even for a year, it's tough to do it. But beyond that, we've just been saying, we've done some long-term estimates. But for beyond '14, we think in '15, that the good number to use is 12% to 14%. But again, that's a pretty high-level estimate. But we haven't really guided it beyond that. The GAAP and the cash rate will converge a little bit over time, but there will always be a significant benefit. And we're seeing that when you look at the rate posted this year, a little over 7% and business initiatives and restructuring that we've done clearly is adding shareholder value to the company.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go back to the line of Mike Walkley from Cannacord.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "With the strong cash that you've been generating, can you just share your thoughts on additional buybacks or a potential dividend given your predictable business now with the strong cash returns.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, thanks, Mike. It's something that we look at regularly. We're always analyzing the capital structure because we do have some alternatives to consider. And when you look at the business model and the growth opportunity from the top line and translating that into the 30-plus percent, we just think buying back stock continues to be a really strong way to deliver shareholder value. But you want to balance that with having cash available to maintain financial flexibility for strategic growth initiatives. So we try to balance those two out. We did repurchase 8 million of shares, 8 million shares in '13, which was $173 million. And at some point, dividend is certainly something we would consider as well.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And Don, just while I have you, can you tell us what you said for the tax rate next year? I missed that.", "Donald W. Palette", "In '14?", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Cash tax rate.", "Donald W. Palette", "10%. 10%.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Sorry for all the questions, guys. But overall, your Wi-Fi, is all your Wi-Fi components included in your HPA, none of it is in your cellular at this point, is that correct?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Ed, in the 40-60 split, the 40% HPA and 60%. In that split, all of the Wi-Fi mobile connectivity business is in that 40%. That's correct.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Okay. And increasingly, with carrier aggregation release 10 and LTE coming up here, I know there's a lot of designs in the work that focus more on the switching aspects of it, especially the front end of it, of the carrier aggregation. I know that it gets larger. How do you see yourself positioned there? I know of Microtech [ph] too, the antenna switch modules at Apple, which is obviously a key piece for the 2015 or '14 phone. But Skyworks is also very big in SOI and growing. Do you feel that you're in a competitive position for a lot of those designs next year and the year after that kind of focus on CA and the SOI product?", "David J. Aldrich", "You're right, Ed. And one of the -- really, the big driver of carrier aggregation in terms of overall content is very precise switching algorithm that need to take place. And so, and as I said, I think we are a leader, if not the leader in SOI. And we have a suite of antenna tuners. We've been shipping them for a long time, both before SOI was used in different ways to affect that tuning in an efficient way. And we're all over that with a good portfolio. We expect to see multiple designs in production in 2014. It's just another, albeit highly complex, analog switching algorithm.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, and I think, Ed, as you know, it represents a substantial increase in complexity and content for providers like Skyworks. We see as many as 30 switch arms in some of the newer smartphones. And absolutely, we're going to be all over it. We've won a couple of major sockets in APAC with carrier aggregation, and we'll be winning more domestically and abroad going into 2014.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "And then, so then Liam, that begs another question there. In carrier -- and there's a lot of talk about it, and I think a lot of investors don't really understand what CA involves right now. But in the big picture, the content increase in CA is mostly focused in what areas? Switching, filtering, PAs, where would you?", "Liam K. Griffin", "It's in switching. I mean, we're not even talking about the PA. Certainly, when you're in a carrier aggregation environment, you have larger protocols and connectivity, LTE, et cetera, but the switch arms go up substantially. And we've been in this business a long time. We have SOI capability. We have P Amp. We'd probably not use it as much in CA. We have filtering capability. And it's certainly a market that we expect to be a leader.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for participating today, and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Operator", "Good afternoon, and welcome to Skyworks Solutions First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti ", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' first fiscal quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a great start to fiscal 2014, as reflected by our strong first quarter performance and above-seasonal guidance for the second quarter. Fueling our success is the proliferation of connectivity in all of its forms across a broad array of end markets and applications. This powerful underlying global trend, combined with our growing analog portfolio, expanding broad market opportunities and consistent execution, all translate into superior ongoing financial results for the company.", "Skyworks has become an enabler of all things connected, providing custom solutions that help our customers navigate increasingly complex analog design challenges. We leverage a comprehensive portfolio of technologies and leading-edge integration capabilities to create differentiated solutions. And as the world becomes increasingly more connected and analog complexity escalates, we're uniquely positioned to capitalize.", "And our strategy is paying off. During the quarter, we delivered revenue of $505 million. That's ahead of our guidance and up more than 11% year-over-year. We produced operating income of $141.8 million. That's up nearly 24% from a year ago. We posted $0.67 in earnings per share. That's up 22% versus a year ago. And we generated $159 million in cash flow from operations, which is a record for the company.", "So in short, Q1 was another excellent quarter for us across all key metrics. And looking ahead, we see our momentum continuing. While March is normally a slower seasonal quarter for the industry, our increasing market diversification and new product ramps are enabling Skyworks to largely offset normal mobile seasonality.", "More specifically, during the second quarter, we're seeing strength from our expanding portfolio for the networked home, connectivity solutions in the emerging markets, key vertical market opportunities and our ramp of integrated systems solutions like SkyOne. These drivers are helping to mute seasonal trends at some of our OEM customers. This is a clear testament to our diversification.", "To put our growth trajectory into perspective, EPS for the first half of 2014, as measured by our first quarter reported results and second quarter guidance, is 2.5x the EPS we reported for the first half of 2010, representing a 25% compounded growth rate over that 4-year period. With our expanding market footprint, the stage is set for continued revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings leverage.", "For more in-depth review of our financial results, I'll turn the call over to Don for his commentary and outlook.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks for joining us, everyone. We appreciate it. Revenue for the first quarter was $505.2 million, ahead of our prior guidance and up more than 11% versus the year-ago quarter and nearly 6% sequentially. Gross profit was $224.7 million or 44.5% of revenue, in line with our prior guidance and up 150 basis points from the year-ago quarter.", "Operating expenses were $82.9 million, consisting of R&D expense of $50.8 million and SG&A expense of $32.1 million. We generated $141.8 million of operating income and that yields a 28.1% operating margin and that's a 280 basis point increase versus the year-ago quarter. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 10%. That produced net income of $127.7 million or $0.67 of diluted earnings per share, $0.01 better than our guidance.", "Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $159 million in cash flow from operations. We invested $16 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $21 million and we repurchased 670,000 shares of our common stock, representing a $17 million investment. Given our confidence in our business outlook, we continue to believe that repurchasing shares of common stock represents a highly attractive use of our cash. And finally, we exited the quarter with $649 million in cash and no debt.", "Now for our second quarter business outlook. With the demand visibility and order backlog we have in place today, we expect second quarter revenue to be $470 million, significantly better than normal seasonality and representing 11% year-over-year top line growth. At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 44% to 44.5%, with operating expenses of approximately $83.5 million.", "We continue to see opportunities for sustainable margin expansion, as we leverage our capital investments and benefit from growing demand for our margin-enhancing integrated custom solutions and precision analog products. Below the line, we anticipate $200,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate of around 10%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2014 fiscal year. We expect the share count to be around 191.5 million shares, resulting in second quarter EPS of $0.59. All of the underlying drivers are in place for Skyworks to continue to outperform.", "It's worth noting that our second quarter 2014 guidance represents our fourth consecutive quarter of over 20% year-over-year earnings growth, and that highlights the consistency of our execution in placing our financial returns among the best-of-breed in the semiconductor industry. We are within striking distance of achieving our mid-term business model of 30% operating margin, which, as a reminder, generates around $3 in annualized earnings per share.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Don. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide some perspective on the growth trends in the market and how we position the company to capitalize. Skyworks is at the forefront of enabling the connected world by providing high-performance analog solutions for end markets, ranging from communications infrastructure and network access points to mobile platforms and connected devices within the home, as well as within key verticals like automotive, industrial, like medical.", "Looking at the high-level drivers of our market opportunity, entering 2014, we see 3 key trends fueling our growth: First, the adoption of higher data rate services across a broader global footprint; second, the rapid proliferation of connectivity into new vertical markets and expanding device categories; and, third, connected devices incorporating more and more network standards. And I'll spend a few minutes going through each of these in a bit more detail.", "Starting first with increasing global demand for high data rate services like 802.11ac and like 4G LTE. The uptake of these technologies, as well as the implementation of multi-antenna architectures and carrier aggregation are still in their infancy, accounting for only a fraction of connected devices today. OEM manufacturers and network operators are rapidly rolling out these technologies in their drive to provide users with a premium connected experience, meaning seamless connections, faster download speeds, improved signal range and longer battery life.", "Over the next couple of years, we expect the global footprint of devices utilizing these standards to grow substantially, and we see tremendous opportunities ahead within the emerging markets where broadband penetration rates are low. Population density, however, is high. And there is a general lack of wired communications infrastructure. As an example, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse estimates that the number of LTE-enabled smartphones in Asia will grow by over 70% over the next 2 years. These opportunities drive increased content along with more stringent performance requirements and higher complexity.", "Second, connectivity is quickly making its way into new vertical markets and its new device categories. A recent report by Morgan Stanley suggests that, by 2020, the total number of connected devices could reach a staggering 75 billion. The billions of connected devices that make up the Internet of Things will be powered by a combination of sensors, microcontrollers and perhaps more importantly for Skyworks connectivity and power management solutions, dramatically expanding our served addressable markets.", "Validating this theme is Google's acquisition of Nest's technologies, with whom we have an extremely strong relationship and high content. We spent the last few years positioning the company for this trend, investing significant resources in new growth verticals outside of mobile in markets like automotive, medical and industrial. These remain a strategic area of investment for us and have contributed to our recent outperformance.", "On top of this, the 2014 CES, or Consumer Electronic Show, showcased an entirely new generation of connected devices, like wearable technologies, home automation products, fitness gear, health and wellness products and machine-to-machine devices. While these new products are still in the early stages of evolution, we have already developed traction in this exciting new growth avenue.", "Our third growth driver is connected devices incorporating more and more network standards. This is happening across our service markets like the smart home, where we have an exciting and diverse pipeline of opportunities. As one current example, we are engaged on a media gateway design for a leading network operator, which provides the functionality of a traditional set-top box with enhanced capabilities to support home networking and streaming on-demand video. This product incorporates Skyworks' ZigBee, Wi-Fi and GPS solutions, along with a number of our power management products. And we have similar opportunities and applications within the home, spanning gaming, entertainment, security and automation. In these examples, Skyworks is providing the complete analog connectivity solution, driving content expansion for us and the opportunity to differentiate through system customization.", "These macro trends in our end markets today validate the strategic directions we've set for the company. We've spent the last decade putting in place sustainable differentiators to simplify complex design challenges across a diverse set of end markets. We're experts in analog system design, leveraging a global force of systems and applications engineers within key vertical markets. We offer an unmatched technology portfolio and strategic partnerships with outside foundries, providing deep expertise in SOI, CMOS, gallium arsenide filters, silicon germanium and on and on; and we have leading capabilities in advanced multi-chip module integration.", "A prime example of our differentiation in the market is our SkyOne platform, which leverages all of these competitive advantages to provide unprecedented levels of integration and performance. We ramped SkyOne with our 2 first customers this quarter, Samsung and HTC, and we expect to add new customers throughout the year.", "We also captured other new design wins during the quarter across a number of diverse applications, including 802.11ac solutions in set-top boxes, Blu-ray players and LED/4K TVs, RF subsystems for Ericsson for 4G LTE base stations, power management devices within Philips' wearable technologies and health and wellness applications, connectivity ICs supporting Nest's suite of smart home products, switch models in Belkin's wireless home lighting solutions, envelope tracking solutions within multiple 4G LTE platforms and connectivity ICs in Fitbit's smart scale and connected wristband fitness systems.", "It's clear that we're riding a wave of powerful underlying market forces. We expect these trends to fuel growth in our addressable markets for years to come. And as our product highlights demonstrated, we're capitalizing today.", "In closing, we're quite optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2014 and beyond. Our strategy of continuing to diversify and expand into new verticals while maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working.", "Okay. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] For our first question, it comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Just had a couple of questions. The first, I guess, is what is driving, I guess, this near-term strength that you're seeing? I know you talked about seeing an above-seasonal March quarter here. Is it any one particular customer or end market, or is it more broad than that?", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Rick. The way we see March shaping up is, I think, there'll be fairly normal historical seasonal patterns in mobile. Obviously, we're seeing some OM -- OEMs impacted more than others. I think the difference is our opportunity, or our target, is much broader than others and is basically driven by end market diversification and content gains. I think the specific areas of strength are: We're seeing continuous success and sequential growth in the Connected Home products that I think we talked about a bit in our prepared comments; we're seeing strong demand in emerging markets; we're seeing strong demand in some of the new verticals; and, by the way, we're ramping high ASP and high-margin products like SkyOne. So I think it's a combination of those offsetting seasonality.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, just as a follow-up, in TD-LTE -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you've said in the past you're close to about 50% of MediaTek's quad core designs or reference designs. Is that still true? And what does that trend look like this year? I know you -- as you called out Asia, I think, specifically talking about the opportunity there with LTE devices over the next couple of the years, I'm just -- if you could quantify anything there that would be great.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Yes. This is Liam on that. MediaTek continues to be a really important customer for us. We are on their latest quad core platforms and their newest LTE platforms. And what that means for us is really a significant upgrade in content versus a traditional 2G or even a 3G phone, so we're seeing content around the power amplifier suite moving into more multi-mode complex systems, but we're also, in addition sweeping an ASM technology with switch, GPS in some cases and even seeing Wi-Fi attached. So it's a meaningful cycle, and we're in the very early innings of that upgrade throughout China.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I wonder if you could give us a little bit of color on how China Mobile appears to be factoring into what you just delivered and what you guided to, maybe some indications on how you feel the build-out is going to be and if there's any risk, you think, of a hangover, if we have channel fill and not so much channel sell-through and, I guess, some color on that.", "David J. Aldrich", "So I think -- let me, kind of, answer it maybe in a broad way. We're actually -- what we're seeing in China today and we're seeing some pretty strong growth here, is that, more than anything, the upgrade cycle -- irrespective of which carrier, the upgrade cycle is sweeping in a lot more analog functionality and connectivity in ac [ph] and some of our products for switching and control. We're seeing strong attach rate with QRD, strong attach rate with MediaTek, including some of their workhorse, smartphone, quad core models. And I think, if you look at the big players in China, think of Lenovo, Huawei, Coolpad, and if you look at some of those teardown reports, we've got a lot of content and very high penetration rates. So I think, if you combine all those, we're just pretty broad there and we're seeing a lot of incremental content.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, you've mentioned the diversification strength across some various areas, most of them still having to do with wireless connectivity. Could you comment on where you are in terms of evolving some of your HPA opportunities that aren't cellular attached? I know you talked about Connected Home, but you briefly mentioned power management. Where are you seeing that? How are things going on the wireless infrastructure side?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Alex. Yes. I mean, outside of the core mobile business, we are seeing a lot of diversification and opportunities, home automation, ZigBee-enabled lighting. For example, we have a design win with Philips, where they're using blue light LED inside of a wearable patch for therapeutic purposes. The Fitbit example that Dave mentioned, another outstanding opportunity for us is leveraging Wi-Fi. We're moving into power management with DC-to-DC and voltage regulators. We have LED backlight in automotive applications. Just a broad reach of opportunities, and we feel that our team in the field is picking up more and more opportunities each quarter. We're very excited about where that can go.", "David J. Aldrich", "And, Alex, we've built out a system engineering and an applications infrastructure throughout the world. We're really getting better and better at identifying sockets where we can penetrate, we can customize, gain some real value and add value to our customers. I think, just if you look at the orders we booked this quarter, and I mentioned a few of them, but -- there was Philips. There was Nest. There was FitBit. There was Belkin. So it's really across the board, everything from the cable modem to the gateway products to all kinds of appliances. So it's really across the board.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.", "Anne Edelstein", "This is Anne Edelstein calling in on behalf of Vivek. I guess, the first question is, I look at the way that you are guiding operating expenses in the current quarter, it's coming up somewhat quarter-over-quarter as revenues are declining. Can you just talk -- is that a one-off? Can you talk a little bit more about that and how that factors into your pace [ph] to 30% operating margin?", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure, Anne. This is Don. We've been pretty consistent about our ongoing investment in some of the key areas in the business. Particularly, if you look at the OpEx increase that we just saw from fiscal Q4 to the December quarter fiscal Q1, all of that increase was in R&D and that's a similar pattern that you'll see in our guide from March, and it's really just reflective of some critical investments that we're making in R&D teams to support our continued focus and ability to grow in some of these new vertical markets. So we feel really good about those investments. We've been consistent about our OpEx slowly increasing this year and -- but there's a tremendous amount of leverage still left in the model, when you look at the revenue growth.", "Anne Edelstein", "Great. And then, I guess, a little bit more on the China opportunity. How well positioned do you think that you are currently to grow as the TD-LTE market, sort of, takes off this year? And how do you see your opportunity maybe diversifying a bit into some of the lower end phones?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well -- thanks, Anne. I think that the -- one way to look at it is -- the way we kind of decompose that market and there is going to be some big customer winners or at least high volume drivers within that market. And so, we focused very intently on them. We've done -- as I mentioned, we've done a really good job, we think, with Lenovo, with Huawei, with Coolpad, with some others that are really going to drive a great deal of volume, plus there are hundreds of indigenous OEMs. But we've done really well with, I think, the volume drivers. We've also focused for a long time, as you know, with MediaTek.", "And I'm really very pleased with the amount of penetration we've got in all their reference designs, particularly the workhorses we think that are going to drive high dollar content smartphones. We've got everything from ASM-based products. Now we've got some connectivity products, multi-mode PA switches. So again, the whole -- and I guess the third element, is the whole theme of -- as these phones become more -- smartphones become more complex and indeed feature phone transitions to smartphone and then smartphone move more towards 4K, they're having very high penetration rate of some pretty sophisticated analog processing, and that's where we've been excelling is being able to sell more of the system solution by having our applications engineers and system designers hand-in-hand with our chipset marketers in that region, whether it's MediaTek, QRD -- or Qualcomm QRD, and that's where we're gaining volume and we're gaining share.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Richard Sewell with Stephens.", "Richard Sewell - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "It's Richard calling in for Harsh. So first question, looking out over this year, how are you thinking about the growth opportunity in mobile and specifically in the smartphone end market?", "Liam K. Griffin", "First of all, we're still very bullish on mobile in general and smartphone specifically. We talked about China as a real theme that we're benefiting from. But even in traditional Tier 1 accounts, we continue to see the need for higher data rates, more advanced protocols and that brings complexity to the table. So as we look out through 2014 and the platforms we're designing now for 2015, the performance of these products is going up and up and our ability to deliver simplicity here is exactly what these customers want. So we're really excited about it -- the content theme is coming together. There's more bands. There's a lot of complexity in filtering and tuning. The analog suite that we bring to the table is another real key driver for us. So we like that. We think it's a great trend. We're seeing it with our Tier 1s. And as we talked about already today, we really like what we're seeing in China.", "Richard Sewell - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great. And for my follow-up, what are some of the remaining levers to get to that 30% up margin you always talked about?", "Donald W. Palette", "It's pretty consistent, Richard, with what we've talked about. It's -- number one, it's -- we have said consistently that we need to be at about $550 million per quarter in revenue. With that and with the spending profile we're looking for the rest of the year, that gives you the continued leverage on the OpEx expenses, which help. And we're going to continue to drive margin expansion. And that's a long list of items, whether it's leveraging the CapEx investments we're making, it's the improved margin on some of the new system solutions that are rolling out, it's our hybrid manufacturing model, our ability to keep our utilization at a very high rate, it's how we manage the supply chain. It's multiple things. So if you -- we would expect to drop that incremental revenue to about [ph] 48%, which will continue to drive margins. So it's a combination of both.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Dave, I'm just wondering, you've talked a lot about IoT this -- on the conference call. Clearly, you guys are well positioned with high-performance analog, power management and some of your connectivity solutions. But things like microcontrollers and sensors are also pretty key solutions and could align pretty nicely with your product portfolio. Do you guys have a strategy potentially to either partner or potentially look to expand your product portfolio into those types of devices for IoT?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. Thank you, Quinn. That's a great question. The horses we're riding in '14, '15 will continue to be what we were doing in much of '13, which is -- the earlier question that Richard had was about our feeling about smartphones. Irrespective of what the growth rate of smartphone is, one thing is for certain, that customers need to see more analog solutions that sweep in functionality because they're finding it too difficult to meet the constraints of the baud space, current consumption and so on.", "So we have been increasingly, even if we don't sell it in an integrated platform like SkyOne -- in as integrated a platform as SkyOne, we're able to bundle those products and guarantee the system global performance by working with our customers at the radio baud level. And recently, that's begun to sweep in more and more high-performance Wi-Fi, ac and the like, multi-mode Wi-Fi, GPS-shielded devices that incorporate filtering. We talked about power, lighting and display. That's a big deal, where you're trying to drive very high-performance camera flash, for example, or display. So there's a lot of power management and voltage regulation that this complexity is driving, and we think we're the only folks out there today who can take a complete suite of products and, from a system standpoint, lay it out for them.", "Now when you look at the next click, I am very intrigued by the opportunities for, for example, MEMS-based technology to do things in not only in the microphone space but in gyros and sensors and then taking that product outside. So we are investing, we are creating partnerships that are going to allow us to go to the next click because I think the next big wave is going to be around sensing level functionality and all kinds of motion controls. And we're going to play there, and we're investing now.", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then, the second question I had is -- I mean, you guys are obviously very well positioned in Wi-Fi front-end. There has been some talk about 2 x 2 MIMO potentially moving out -- or moving down from the tablet space into some of the higher end smartphone platforms. Do you guys have a view -- is that a real opportunity for you in 2014, or do you think, for power reasons, that you'd most likely stay 1 x 1 in smartphones?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. It's a great question. We talked a lot about MIMO technology and access points using 3 x 3, even 4 x 4 multiple screens and access points to extend range and performance. We are actually, to your point, seeing this now in smartphones, and we think the benefit provided to the consumer is outstanding. It's, again, higher data rate, greater levels of connectivity, expanded range and the value to the consumer is there. And for us, it actually effectively doubles the content in phones that go 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 would be a triple. So we're excited by it and we like the fact that, again, the relentless demand for connectivity, for data -- for wireless data continues and the kind of solutions that we talked about here are really in high demand now.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "You guys obviously discussed and listed in your press release a whole bunch of non-handset-related drivers. And I was hoping you could give us, sort of, your typical breakout, the cellular group versus analog and -- but in addition to that, I guess, typically, you're like 60-40 or something like that. But within that Wi-Fi portion, that's usually -- a lot of it still seems to be going to handset. So could you say how much is handset and non-handset all in? And what I'm trying to get at is, where are you now and where can you go 3 years out on that non-handset portion?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. Steve, I'm glad you asked that question because the -- I think we recognize that the split we have discussed -- we continue to discuss the 6 [ph] which is today around 60-40. That's consistent this last quarter, really kind of hearkens back to a couple of years ago -- a few years ago when we talked about 80-20 with 80% being dominated by PA and transmit module products and 20% mostly infrastructure, some Home, some Smart Energy.", "The fact is that business today is very different. So if I look at where the growth is coming from -- maybe this will help answer your question. In mobile, for example, the growth is -- our PA business, for example, is declining as a percentage of sales. It's still growing, but it's declining as a percentage of our revenue. And what's growing fast is these mobile analog solutions we're talking about, GPS, Wi-Fi, power display, as well as highly integrated solutions like power amplifier duplexers, SkyOne and the like. That's where the growth.", "And then, the second growth engine has been in non-mobile. We've talked about the Connected Home. We've talked about automotive and medical. So that's really the way we are running the business today. And I think, as we go forward, we'll be looking for ways to kind of articulate better for you what that split is because I think the 60-40 is probably not as useful as it once was.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And you guys really helped us out last quarter. You gave some color, an extra quarter out where you sort of gave us some thoughts on March. I was hoping you might be able to give us some color into June. Obviously, more and more, we're seeing some big OEMs drive that but [indiscernible]. How should we think about seasonality for your -- for you in June? And how is it looking right now?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. I think it's a little too early to get very specific. I would say that I don't see any reason to believe that it won't be a normally modest up quarter. That's usually the case in the June quarter. And as we look at our business rolling out in 2014 for Q2, Q3, Q4, we see similar trends as -- in Q3 as we do in Q2 or in June as we do in March, which is these share gains, content gains, diversification gains largely offsetting whatever seasonal mobile business may be thrown at us. We expect to have a good June quarter. We expect the mobile market to be up modestly a few percentage.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Dave, can you give us a sense on the analog side for March? In terms of your overall guide [Audio Gap] you expect that business to be up sequentially in March. Also, I know there's a lot of different products and units that you could get [ph] on the Internet of Things. I'd love to hear your view on how you can piggyback multiple chipsets and what your view is on overall content for Skyworks in the Internet of Things.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. Thanks. I think that our March non-mobile business will be roughly flat. And so, most of the seasonality is occurring among those OEMs in our mobile business. And if I think within that roughly flat, which is much better than seasonality, it really is -- as we talked about in the prepared comments, it's a combination of, obviously, traditional Wi-Fi products and more Wi-Fi content where we're looking to have multi-mode Wi-Fi that has more ac content and so on and so forth.", "We're also seeing ZigBee content that's meaningful. There's also some real power management and voltage challenges with some of these devices -- these gateway devices we talked about, and we talked at length in the prepared comments about an engagement we have with a service provider today. There's a lot of dollar content and a very cool complex products. And the content there is multiple dollars and it's GPS, it's Wi-Fi, it's cellular.", "So I think it's really all of the above in the Home, and we've talked about brand new nascent products for us. I mean, we're just starting to see meaningful revenue coming from medical devices we talked about, in some automotive devices, in the Volkswagen platform we have in the press release. That's kind of a sleek product going into an in-mounted dash entertainment [ph] Volkswagen device.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, lastly, on your SkyOne comments, the traction you're seeing there, is that more in the low end, midrange phones [ph] love to hear your view on where it's ending up.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Tony. Yes. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have 2 customers right now in production, HTC and Samsung. We're making great progress with both. We're in high-volume production on some very sleek smartphones. There's a number of customers right now that are in various stages of sampling, some traditional Tier 1, some players in Asia. But we certainly expect, as we see success with those 2 customers, we expect several more to ramp during the calendar year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "This holiday season, it seems that the carriers were more aggressive in subsidizing LTE tablets, especially on the Android side. Have you seen a discernible mix shift from WiFi-only tablets to LTE? And is that helping some of your growth drivers into the near term?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. That's a great question. As you know, we've seen really nice attach with Wi-Fi and tablets, and we're also, by the way, seeing tablet expanding dramatically from some of the real strong U.S.-based Tier 1s to a burgeoning market in China. So there -- that's good. So we see unit increase there that's substantial. All of that's been WiFi-enabled. But it is true we're starting to see more and more LTE -- full cellular LTE engines attaching with Wi-Fi. In the past, it may have been about 25% to 30% penetration. We've seen some companies go 100%. But certainly, the dial is moving up, and that does present a real significant pop in content for us.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. I think, Mike, it wasn't much -- it's not a big driver in this last quarter, but I think the trend is clearly there and I expect it to be meaningful in out quarters.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay. And then, follow-up question -- and that's helpful, Dave. A follow-up question, just going back to some of these interesting design wins and kind of the Internet of Things market, a lot of these early-stage ramps are much smaller than, say, a handset ramp. So how do the gross margins compare now and how can the gross margins in this division maybe improve over time as some of these things, like Nest, could ramp into really big units longer term?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes. Mike, as we've said, if you look at the suite of products and systems solutions that we're delivering in the diversified analog space, they are typically accretive to the overall corporate margins. So as we're successful, continuing to gain share and grow that business, it's going to, without question, move our margins forward. But I do want to point out, the margin expansion that you're seeing as well is the value add that we're doing in the complex system solutions that's tied into the mobile space as well. We're having some real good success there, too. So it's both. But clearly, the analog -- that analog piece of business growth margins will expand.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Mike Burton with Brean Capital.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Wanted to follow up on that question -- on the previous one on SkyOne ramping this quarter. Can you remind us the type of dollar content you get there compared to your average and maybe help describe some of those initial platforms you've secured?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Certainly. Yes. Well, SkyOne is a meaningful increase in content versus even our traditional Tier 1 engagements. So it provides not only a full multi-mode, multi-band power amplifier solutions, we bring in expertly matched and tuned filters. It's configurable. We can make a unique platform for any given customer. And what we also provide is a great deal of the engineering systems benefit. So a customer that has a time-to-market challenge or is spending their R&D budget on look-and-feel industrial design software screens, we can unburden them completely from this cycle engine [ph], so there's a lot of value.", "The 2 customers that we named, they're really just the beginning. Very proud to be within Samsung, I mean, they're the market leader in this space across the board. They found a great deal of value in our solution. HTC, another player that does incredible industrial design and really good brand, really good look and feel. We were a perfect solution there. And there's a long list of others that we're in various stages of sampling today, so we're quite bullish on our opportunity there.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, also, can you talk a little bit about the wireless infrastructure market? How big is exposure there now for you guys? And have you begun to see any life there? And then, just lastly, any 10% customers?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. On the infrastructure side, I mean, it's an important market for Skyworks and it's been relatively flat over the last few years. We have strong position with Ericsson, with Huawei, with ZTE, Nokia-Siemens, so all of those players. We're starting now to see, finally, some upside with LTE rollouts. Everything that we've spoken about with respect to China and even the smartphone gains in the U.S. are moving towards 4G and LTE solutions. There needs to be that commensurate network infrastructure to handle the data. So we're finally seeing it. It's not double digit right now, but it's slowly moving in that direction. Fortunately, for us, over the last few years, we've really been doing a nice job expanding our reach, adding a lot of new products there, whether they be power management products or highly customized analog solutions. So we'll be in good shape when that market picks up.", "Donald W. Palette", "And, Mike, the -- it was -- the 10% were Foxconn and Samsung during the quarter.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A couple of questions. One, I just want to better understand the comments on seasonality. You said the nonmobile would be flat. I guess, everybody has got the old metrics, the 60-40, and I'm assuming that comment assumes some portion of that 40% is also mobile. I know you didn't break out Dave, but if you could just clarify that.", "David J. Aldrich", "I was -- when I talked about the nonmobile being relatively flat, I just mean everything that's not in the smartphone. That's what I mean.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. And then, if you could just talk about seasonality. It's hard, and there's no real -- given the concentration in customers, things like the seasonality changes every year. Last year, you benefited from a new product ramp. Are you seeing any benefits to the upside as far as major products? Or kind of, if you can just talk about what you're seeing from a seasonality in mobile. Are you seeing products platforms ramp down? Are you getting any benefit? You mentioned SkyOne, but I'm assuming that's not a huge number. Is there any sort of ups versus normal seasonality in mobile besides SkyOne?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, we actually do, Blayne. We see a couple of customers -- or some customers being pretty dramatically down. It's just normal the way they've rolled their products out. We see others up. We see some customers within China up.", "We -- it's no secret that Samsung tends to take their inventory down and have a soft December. That occurred for us. That's less so in the March quarter, so that's a contributor. We are ramping SkyOne. As Liam mentioned, that has high dollar content. And again, this portion of the business that is nonmobile or outside of a smartphone, we're seeing some nice tablet growth, some nice high dollar content products in these vertical markets. So I think it's really a combination of all those things. But we're certainly not immune from OEMs taking the smartphone volumes down in March. We see some of that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "SkyOne. So I think there's some confusion in the investor base when Qualcomm talks about RF360. I think a lot of folks think SkyOne is a similar product, but it's quite a bit different, isn't it, Liam? It looks like maybe MMPA, some amplifiers, but much more focused on the hardened bands [ph], but more utility. Can you just give us a really brief descriptions of, one, what's in it; and, two, how it varies from what a lot of people think is going on with RF360?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Well, one of the most important parts is that it's made up of proven core building blocks that have been proven in Skyworks for years. We also have the ability to uniquely configure the solution, so it is not a one-shop-fits-all, kind of, solution. A lot of the work, the tuning, the matching, bringing in multiple bands of filters, using different technologies, as Dave pointed out, we have a very strong partnership with filter players [ph].", "We can bring in BAW solutions, we can bring in SAW -- temp comp SAW. We can weave in our own power management, ET-based solutions if needed and then deliver unique MMPAs that wrap around it. So the ability to configure -- highly configure customer by customer rather than give a single monolithic solution is very important to us. We found each engagement to end up uniquely with a different design, and we found our benefit to deliver time-to-market. Our systems and tuning expertise from our teams, all to be really differentiators for SkyOne.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "And then, you've mentioned several times that not only just high dollar content but also your margin profile this product is -- is it accretive to mobile, accretive to consolidated margins? Can you give us a feel for that? And does that include any of -- you mentioned the [indiscernible] controller, et cetera or digital controller. Does it include any of the ET products, by that, I mean, amplifiers or modulators?", "Donald W. Palette", "As Liam said, it's a platform. So case-by-case, the margin profile can swing. But generally, it's at or above our best margins we would see typically in the mobile space. So that's kind of the way to think of it.", "David J. Aldrich", "And, Ed, with respect to ET, it does not include the ET modulator today. It does include ET PAs tuned and designed from the ground up to be high performance in ET mode.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Suji De Silva with Topeka.", "Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "So can you talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace from integrated solutions like Qualcomm's RF360 if you're seeing traction there, perhaps, competitively?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes. Thank you. We don't see -- the short answer is, no, we don't see traction competitively from the RF360 today. I will say that, by its nature, that product and to some degree, our SkyOne -- or, at least, elements within our SkyOne family, they're very highly integrated products, lots of bands, lots of filtering. We see certain customers -- while perhaps somewhat limited in scope, that really need somebody to come in and step up and provide more functionality. PA-centric, albeit but more functionality.", "And so -- and then, on top of that, we try to bolt and we do bolt around that front-end functionality, that transmit chain functionality, a lot of GPS, power management, tuning devices. So I would say that we don't see competitive threat today, if you will, but we do see an opportunity to compete in the sense that both products provide for that segment of the market a complete solution. I'll also mention that we really are seeing a lot more content attach rate with Qualcomm, whether it's QRD or Qualcomm here with a lot more product. So I'm really delighted with the amount of partnership, the relationship and the fact that we have a lot of dollar content.", "Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful color. And then, on the balance sheet, you did a good job buying back shares here, but you're generating a lot of cash and building up a significant amount of cash balance. What's the comfortable level of cash for you guys? And would you contemplate dividend given the strength of your fundamentals?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Suji. We did -- Thanks. We ended the quarter at $649 million in cash, and we're really happy with our consistent ability and the velocity with which we convert the strong earnings into cash flow. We're always looking at the capital structure. And clearly, when you look at our financial growth opportunities in the model going forward, that we're going to continue to buy back stock. We think it's an excellent way to deliver shareholder value.", "And just to frame that for everybody, we -- over the last 5 quarters, we have spent around $190 million on share buybacks. We still have over $200 million approved by the board of share buybacks. So we'll continue to be in the market to do that. You balance that with maintaining the financial flexibility for strategic growth initiatives. So that's one of the things that we do. And then, we absolutely are looking at a dividend as a possibility in the future. There's no question.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Hoping to get a little bit more on your capital spending plans or your capital addition plans for the year.", "Donald W. Palette", "Hello. Yes, sure, Tom. I would -- we don't really provide guidance going out, but CapEx for us is really volume dependent. So as we're making CapEx investments above our depreciation level around $20 million, that's a positive thing. The payback on the capital we're putting in is generally very, very short, and it's based on our visibility to volumes. I think it's safe to say that you should be thinking about something slightly above our depreciation level for now for the last 3 quarters of the fiscal year. That's a safe starting place.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, when you look at some of your integrated modules, can you talk more about the potential to get access to BAW filters in the future?", "David J. Aldrich", "Sure. Well, it's interesting, the integrated modules, whether it be PADs or SkyOne, if you look at the teardown reports, we've got a fairly big footprint now in filters. We are in production today with a host of different SAW devices. We're now shipping temperature-compensated SAW products and designing those into our modules. And we expect, throughout 2014, for there to be some bands. There won't be very many of them, but there'll be some bands because of the tight band spacing and coupled with high frequency, where there will be some BAW devices.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And do your suppliers have access to that yet?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, yes.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I just want to get your thoughts on who your top 10 -- the 3 -- or top 3 major customers in the quarter [indiscernible] how do you see the China market?", "Donald W. Palette", "Well, Vijay, the top 10 -- the only 10% customers this quarter were Foxconn and Samsung.", "David J. Aldrich", "And I think the China market, we're expecting to see very robust smartphone growth. We're seeing 4G attach. We've got a good lineup of our products with QRD, Qualcomm and with MediaTek and others, and we're benefiting not only from the increased complexity on the transmit side, but we're sweeping in a lot more high-performance Wi-Fi connectivity power lighting and display and some voltage and power. So we're seeing an increase in content as the shift to smartphone occurs. So we feel very good about China.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And if I may have a follow-up, when you look at the gross margins, you're doing very well on the gross margin side. What are the levers that should go through 2014 on that? Obviously, some are very nicely, but how do you see that going forward?", "David J. Aldrich", "For '14...", "David J. Aldrich", "As I said, we want you to continue to model an incremental 48%, which is going to expand margin as we grow. And it's driven by a long list of items, the products -- the new products we're releasing, the design, the system solutions, the value-add that's driving margin. Our focus on the metrics in the factory in driving yield and productivity leveraging the CapEx investment, so it's a long list of things that will continue to enable us to drive that margin expansion forward.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "David J.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Steve Ferranti", "Thank you, Rick. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' second fiscal quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with the business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "Dave Aldrich", "Thanks, Steve, and welcome, everyone. I'm happy to report that Skyworks delivered another very strong performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, outpacing normal seasonality and exceeding expectations across our key metrics.", "The combination of robust year-over-year revenue growth, earnings leverage and strong cash flow we posted in the seasonally soft March quarter is a clear testament to the benefits of our diversification strategy. All-in-all, I\u2019m quite pleased with our accomplishments in the first half and expect our momentum to continue as our market footprint and customer engagement expand.", "The world is rapidly becoming more interconnected from the cloud to the data center, to wide area networks, into the enterprise and vertical markets and within the home. Skyworks is a key enabler of this global megatrend, providing custom analog solutions that facilitate connectivity across a wide range of communications protocol.", "These positive market dynamics create complementary growth opportunities for us with a new product categories like media gateways, like small cells and tablets, and in entirely new verticals like the enterprise, medical and automotive. And as analog design complexity rises, it creates the need for highly specialized systems, driving higher addressable content opportunities.", "We\u2019re capitalizing on this today by leveraging our analog design expertise, expanding our product portfolio and integration capabilities, which when combined with our consistent execution, translates into superior financial results. Specifically during the quarter, we delivered revenue of $481 million that\u2019s ahead of our guidance of $470 million and up more than 13% year-over-year.", "We produced operating income of $130 million, which is up over 30% from a year ago. And we posted $0.62 in earnings per share, that\u2019s up 29% versus a year ago and our fourth consecutive quarter above 20% earnings growth. We generated $214 million in cash flow from operations which is another record for the company. And we also repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock and we announced the quarterly dividend of 11% per share.", "So in summary, Q2 was an excellent quarter for us across the board. Looking, ahead we see strong demand signal spending our end markets in 4G solutions for emerging market and new 802.11ac deployments in network infrastructure but connected home and other key vertical market opportunities.", "In short, fiscal 2014 is shaping up to be a very good year for Skyworks. With the opportunity pipeline we have in place, the stage is set for continued revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings leverage.", "So for more in-depth review of our financials, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don for his commentary and his outlook.", "Don Palette", "Thanks Dave and thanks again for joining us everyone. Revenue for the second quarter was $481 million, ahead of our prior guidance and up more than 30% versus the year-ago quarter.", "Gross profit was $215.2 million or 44.7% of revenue, better than our prior guidance and up 250 basis points from a year ago quarter. Gross margin upside was driven by strong adoption of our integrated system solutions, margin accretive new product introductions and strength in key vertical markets.", "Operating expenses were $84.8 million consisting of R&D expense of $53.1 million to support organic growth initiatives and SG&A expense of $31.7 million. We generated $130.4 million of operating income yielding 27.1% operating margins, that\u2019s a 370 basis point increase versus the year-ago quarter and it highlights the continued strength of our business model in our execution.", "Operator profits were up 31% year-on-year. And let\u2019s put this in perspective. We have delivered an incremental of $107 million in revenue year-to-date versus the first half of fiscal 2013.", "We successfully converted this into $58 million in operating profits and that represents a 54% contribution margin as we leverage capital investments and reap the benefits of our margin enhancing integrated custom solutions and precision analog products. Cash tax rate for the second quarter was 9%, producing net income of $118.6 million or $0.62 of diluted earnings per share and that\u2019s $0.03 better than our guidance.", "Turning to our second quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $214 million in cash flow from operations and invested $41.8 million in capital expenditures in support of upcoming program ramps. Depreciation was $21.7 million.", "We also repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock during the quarter, representing a $61.5 million investment. With the confidence we have in our business outlook, we continue to believe that repurchasing shares, common stock represent a highly accretive use of our cash. And finally, we exited the quarter with $798 million in cash and no debt.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to our third quarter business outlook. Based on the order backlog we have in place today, we expect third quarter revenue to be $535 million and that\u2019s up 23% year-over-year driven by strength in the emerging markets, content gains in key programs, 802.11ac deployments in an expanding set of opportunities within the internet of things.", "At this revenue level, we suggest modeling gross margin in the 45% range with operating expenses of approximately $86 million. Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses and the cash tax rate around 10%.", "We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of the 2014 fiscal year. We expect the share count to be around 193 million shares resulting in third quarter EPS of $0.73 and that\u2019s up 35% year-over-year.", "It\u2019s worth noting that our third quarter guidance represents our fifth consecutive quarter of about 20% year-over-year earnings growth, reflecting the strength of our demand for our products, our differentiation in the market place and the consistency of our execution.", "As Dave mentioned earlier, we initiated a quarterly dividend with initial payment set at $0.11 per share, implying roughly at 1.2% dividend yield. With the combination of the newly initiated dividend in our ongoing share repurchase activity, we are returning roughly 40% of free cash flow to shareholders, a pace which we believe strike the appropriate balance between internal investment for growth initiatives and shareholders returns.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to briefly recap our previously announced revenue split, in order to provide investors with better visibility for the growth and profit drivers of our business. Last quarter, we highlighted three new subgroups, power amplifiers, integrated mobile systems and broad markets. For the first half of fiscal 2014, power amplifiers was 40% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 33% and broad markets was 27%.", "We expect these percentages to stay relatively consistent throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2015 and beyond, we see integrated mobile systems and broad markets revenue continuing to grow as an overall percentage of our mix, which should support improved returns based on the high differentiation and better margins associated with these products.", "And with that, I will turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.", "Dave Aldrich", "Thanks, Don. While it\u2019s clear that our business fundamentals remain quite healthy, but the outlook for Skyworks is strong. To review the high-level drivers for our business in 2014 and 2015, we see three key trends powering our growth.", "First, increasing worldwide demand for high-performance, high data rate broadband services like 802.11ac and 4G LTE. Uptake of this technologies are still in their infancy, accounting for just the fraction of connected devices today. These technologies underpin lucrative new revenue streams for carriers and ecosystem providers alike and are being very aggressively deployed.", "And today, we are seeing tremendous demand within the emerging markets across large global brands as well as regional players. As one measure of this, Credit Suisse estimates that the number of LTE connected smartphones in Asia will grow by over 70% over the next two years.", "Second, connectivity is proliferating in new vertical markets in new device categories. A recent report on Morgan Stanley suggests that by 2020, the total number of connected devices could reach a staggering 75 billion, dramatically expanding our addressable opportunities.", "And we spend the last few years positioning the company for this trend, investing significant resources in new growth verticals outside of mobile, within markets like automotive, medical and industrial. While these new products are still in the early stages of adoption, we have already developed strong traction in these exciting new growth avenues.", "And third, dollar content opportunities for connected devices is expanding. In some cases, this is driven by products incorporating multiple network standards in concert like 4G LTE, 802.11ac and GPS. In other cases, it maybe driven by our expanded product offering where we are more fully integrating our power management and antenna tuning and received diversity product portfolios.", "But in all cases, we are driving our addressable content higher in each successive generation of technology. And just to give one example, the leading 802.11ac chipset provider recently announced the industry\u2019s first six stream MIMO router solution, which provides data speeds of up to 3.2 gigabits per second and that\u2019s 50% faster than current generation ac products, providing users with the availability to stream simultaneous HD or high definition content wirelessly on several devices at once. This is an analog content rich application where performance is paramount.", "Skyworks is enabling this lead architecture with an entire suite of analog products and we expect to benefit from the roll out of these during the second half of this calendar year. In all cases, the fundamental need is the same, ensuring seamless connectivity across multiple communications standards, while maximizing overall system performance within the smallest possible footprint.", "This underlying market need creates tremendous design challenges for our customers, as they contend with issues like battery life, signal interference and data throughput. To solve these challenges, customers are demanding more than just the best standalone component and our increasing aligning with Skyworks based on our end-to-end product portfolios, our broad technology footprint, our robust system design capabilities and our integration roadmap.", "We see a very limited number of other competitors with this whole [Technical Difficulty] growth of capabilities. And to highlight some examples of our recent success, during Q2, we captured other new design wins across a number of diverse applications. These include analog control ICs at Medtronic or implantable hard monitors, a suite of five front-end devices for the Moto G smartphone, home automation solutions with security sensors motion detectors, lighting and meters.", "Switching Wi-Fi and GPS within a set-top box application from EchoStar and tuning IC's see for Audi's HomeLink programmable system, complementing the navigational assist design we announced with Volkswagen last quarter. And finally, we have secured our fourth production customer for SkyOne, which includes a full suite of Skyworks products including our generation 2.0s SkyOne module, our Sky Hi LTE power amplifiers, power management, antenna switching and diversity switch modules.", "Our strategy of continuing to diversify and expand its new verticals, while maintaining a laser focus on operational execution is clearly working. We are quite optimistic about our prospects for 2014 and beyond and it is clear that we are riding a wave of powerful underlying market focus. We expect these positive trends to fuel growth in our addressable markets for years to come and as our product highlights demonstrated, we are capitalizing today.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Rick Schafer. Please go ahead.", "Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Yeah. Thanks guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I guess I was hoping -- my first question is if, Dave, you can provide maybe a little more color on what's driving or what's behind the better than seasonal -- much better than seasonal June quarter, is there any particular customers or end markets or anything you can highlight there?", "Dave Aldrich", "Thanks, Rick. Well, it\u2019s really very broad based. It\u2019s across our mobile customer set and our broad market customer set. It\u2019s within the three categories that we described in the prepared comments. And specifically what we are seeing is very high content in early stage of an LTE ramp in emerging markets. This is China but it\u2019s also outside of China in Central, Latin America.", "We are seeing signs of some strengthening demand in network infrastructure. But more importantly, 802.11ac rollouts in mobile and across vertical segments are very strong for us right now. We are seeing in the connected home and as we said, we are begging to ramp even further and deeper with our SkyOne customer set. And as we mentioned earlier with the guidance in Q3, the year-to-date total is over 15% year-over-year growth. So it\u2019s really very broad-based and there is no single customer and there is no single platform that\u2019s having -- that\u2019s driving in.", "Rick Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Got it. And then just as my follow-up, could you give some color to describe sort of the recent GS 5 launch and your content there? I mean I guess, were there any surprises there for you guys versus your expectation and maybe as part of that answer, how does that Samsung content opportunity here in the first half compare to the other big platform launch later this year for you guys?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, Rick. This is Liam. With respect to the Galaxy S5, as we know, there are a number of different regional SKUs. We actually did quite well in the platform in aggregate, number of designs wins with MMMB solutions, power management solutions. We're diversified across two major baseband platforms. And overall, our revenue growth there within Samsung is going to be up in 2014. And as we look beyond 2014, we are starting to now engage early with the Galaxy S6 and we are seeing another opportunity where performance is up, content opportunities are up and we expect to pick up share there as well.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Alex Gauna. Please go ahead.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities", "Hey, thanks. Let me echo the congratulations on the powerful result. I was wondering with regard to the June quarter guidance, I know you said it was broad-based, but I'm wondering based on the magnitude of these emerging market ramps, what does that say about the dry powder that is left for seasonality in the September quarter? Could we still see a typical double-digit or double-digitish type of growth then or are we robbed from some of that?", "Dave Aldrich", "No, it would be lot easier to answer that question if it was really been driven by one phenomenon and it\u2019s not. I mean, we are seeing, as I said, there is trend around, instead of things product moving into the home, there is a lot of fairly early stage ramps that we are seeing irrespective of seasonality in the March quarter that we are seeing extended to June. We are seeing LTE ramp in China, but we are also seeing other rollouts in connectivity ac and so on. So it\u2019s really not anyone customer or anyone on region. If I look at what I can see in September today, I think expect September to be normal season. I think September will be up and I think it will be a strong quarter for the industry and a strong quarter for us.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities", "All right. Thank you. And then you've done a great job getting to your gross margin targets. I'm wondering with the merger of TriQuint and RFMD and what you're seeing in the market in new opportunities, what's your potential to move beyond that and actually I'd like to know what you think or what your customers are telling you about what they think of the TriQuint-RFMD merger? Thank you.", "Dave Aldrich", "Thanks, Alex. Good question. You know I will you what I think about, I think consolidation is very healthy for our industry, particularly when it involves companies, competitors who have excess capacity. I think the fact that there will be a need to collapse some of that capacity, consolidate design centers and so on, which my understanding of the merger, I think that\u2019s very good for the industry and it\u2019s particularly good for Skyworks. I think a broader, like if I move up a little bit and think about this more broadly, we are seeing fewer and fewer competitors with the capability require to deal with this analog complexity.", "When we talk about SkyOne or we talk about the content gains we are gaining in platforms both in connectivity or within mobile, it\u2019s a lot of GPS, it\u2019s a lot of power management, it\u2019s sliding and display, location-based services, it\u2019s from pretty sophisticated tuning using SOI technology, it\u2019s very broad. And our customers are -- one of the reasons why we are growing much faster than market is our customers are asking us to solve the overall analog front end. It maybe a bundle, it maybe integrated in the case of SkyOne and there just aren\u2019t many competitors that can do that. So I expect more consolidation because I think it\u2019s getting harder and harder to sell even the best among point products and components. And that\u2019s very good for us.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Vivek Arya with BofA ML. Please go ahead.", "Vivek Arya - BofA ML", "Thank you for taking my question. Dave, I am curious about the WiFi growth that you are seeing in 802.11ac because we are hearing that the Broadcom is now starting to integrate more power amplifiers in their WiFi combo chips. And I am wondering does that cannibalize the Europe business in any way, how should we think about competition in that market?", "Liam Griffin", "This is Liam. What we see in WiFi is a certain set of customers that will adopt an integrated PA solution. So by that, I mean, they take the transmit PA and integrate that to SoC. For that part of the market, we have a very compelling receive side strategy. We take SOI switch and LNAs on the receive side and we deploy solutions there and that\u2019s going well. But the larger part of the market today is still adopting 802.11ac with both 5 gig and [2.4] (ph). Our position there is outstanding. We are seeing some of the leading smartphones companies now go to 2 x 2 MIMO in mobile again with 5 gig and 2.4. So that\u2019s playing out well. And in parallel as Dave alluded to earlier, there is a very strong networking in access point and router market that is growing quickly. And here we see three streams, six streams up and nine streams of MIMO, you have 5 gig, 2.4 and switches as well. So in total, the WiFi opportunity for Skyworks is outstanding. We continue to take share. We have great technology. We partnered with Broadcom. We partnered with Qualcomm and others and the outlook there is quite bright.", "Vivek Arya - BofA ML", "Thanks, Liam. Very helpful. And then maybe Dave if you take a step back and look at the overall industry right recently RFMD and Triquint announced that they plan to merge. I am wondering what your view is of that industry consolidation. And as part of that, I think you have also spoken about looking for opportunities on the M&A front. So how do you think about the RF industry structure and then how do you think about your own long-term strategy and what Skyworks will look like say three, four, five years from now?", "Dave Aldrich", "Thanks, Vivek. (indiscernible) RF industry. It\u2019s the analog connectivity of mobile industry because it\u2019s hard to sell an RF-only product today and there in lies some of the problem and some of the need for consolidation. So when we are engaging today, we are engaging typically with multiple dollars in a broad target within our customers say because they are asking us to look at the voltage being provided to the transmit path, they are asking us to filter and switch and tune in a way that preserves battery life even beyond the power added efficiencies of the amplifier. And when we move in to receive or GPS, there are lot of coexistence problems, a lot of interference problems, so we do things in manufacturing for the proprietary shielding or we are able to do things with filtering, whether it\u2019s a PAD or designing around duplex or filter architecture. And so that is just going to continue.", "So I think that there are going to -- there is a going to be a shake out most likely in the analog space where there are companies who have scale, customer relationships and the breadth of technology that can ramp a system integration mindset and capability. And I think companies who can do that, there aren\u2019t many are going to win, they are going to win a lot because this market is going to grow. And I think that will continue.", "So as we look at our M&A strategy, we have, if you look what we have done in the past starting Conexant, if you look at what we did with AATI or even SGI, we have been to convert a broader technology footprint where we have the customers, we have the scale, we have the manufacturing into high returns into a much broader target. We\u2019d like to continue to do that. So as we see M&A opportunities to expand into new vertical markets or expand the content, add more value, more relevance to our customers we will continue to do that. And we don\u2019t rule out highly accretive businesses that required would give us materially bigger footprint outside of mobile. We like those as well, but they need to be rationalized in terms of our ability to add sales leverage in some degree of operational synergy.", "Operator", "(Operator Instruction) Our next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Steve Smigie - Raymond James", "Great. Thanks a lot. And I will add my congratulations on the great quarter and guide. Just as we look to the June guidance, can you talk if you picked up maybe a major socket at your leading customer, that\u2019s maybe you already start shipping that say in the June quarter that helped that or is that nothing to be part of that?", "Dave Aldrich", "No, there is no customer ramp, there is no specific socket that\u2019s driving, that\u2019s driving June. As I said, it\u2019s broad-based. It\u2019s a number of customers. It\u2019s emerging markets, and it\u2019s a non global vertical market.", "Steve Smigie - Raymond James", "Okay. And the 802.11ac, I mean, again it sounds like that\u2019s broad-based as well in terms of being across enterprise networking but also connect your device but also on a handset. And on the handset side, I mean would you -- if you shipped in say modules for large customer end, would that already be occurring this quarter, I mean would you ship in the model say -- a module say quarter and half ahead of a major launch?", "Dave Aldrich", "The answer to that, the simple answer is no.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum", "Hey, guys, my congrats as well. Don, I don\u2019t know if you have this handy but the percentage of your mobile revenue that\u2019s in China, also a little more information on SkyOne date in terms of you got forecast raise now. What kind of feedback you expect to continue to add, new customers, is that largely finding its way into the China market, and last but not least, I would love to hear your further thoughts on content on the [IOT] (ph) side if you are able to get across car management other chipsets into those devices in addition to connectivity? Thanks.", "Don Palette", "I will just go first one on, I\u2019ll take Tony on China. If you were to look at China combined as a customer, it would be 10%, very diverse customer base.", "Dave Aldrich", "And I think with respect to SkyOne and let we have jumped it on this one. But to be clear SkyOne is a broad platform approach and it embodies that we\u2019re moving away from point solutions to its more integrated solutions. Typically, SkyOne platform for us is highly reconfigurable, but it hasn\u2019t common, it has a lot of switching control content moving up to the antenna filtering, duplexing, power amplification. And when we will get the more product categories, it could be integrated at [MCM] (ph) and at the IC level. It is quite margin accretive and it is very unique and it is without competition. So it\u2019s by definition competitive, unique and sticky.", "Don Palette", "Yes, and a follow-on to that, I think what is really kind of winning the hearts and minds of our customers is our ability to configure and customize on-site customer by customer. So what we are pleased by the systems level approach that we have been taking, it\u2019s been well received by customers. We have got a number of introductions today. We are adding new accounts. And as you mentioned China, I mean that market is perfect for us. We can come in there with a solution that is fully tuned and matched specifically for each customer again there and due to work we get those accounts to market.", "Dave Aldrich", "And think about it, there are really three approaches that we use to go to market. One is the SkyOne, highly integrated filtering switching amplification. Another is a power amplifier duplexing kind of a market where we would then wrap switching functionality around that maybe GPS, maybe some power management, and a almost always WiFi. And the third would be which would be kind of an MM/MB multimode power. And again, we would wrap a lot of analog content around it and we have different customers that favor one architecture over another. So some use all three, increasingly through the trend is toward more integration and less discrete.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.", "Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity", "All right, thank you. Just jumping back into the China market, can you talk maybe about the sequential growth you\u2019re seeing from China and your strong June quarter guidance. And were there any near-term supply constraints in the March quarter that might have been -- affected your ability ship into the TD-LTE ramps in China in the March quarter?", "Don Palette", "Yeah. With respect to -- I will take the June quarter first. I mean, China will be up in June. It\u2019s pretty much in line with our total business. There could be some upside with LTE. We are seeing some roll off there across a number of indigenous China customers. We are also seeing as Dave mentioned emerging markets in general. We have some customers today that are gaining share in Latin America, we\u2019re populating those devices. We see some of our customers gain share in India. We\u2019re populating those devices as well.", "Dave Aldrich", "And we also see in terms of content, there is a drive because if you look at the indigenous China players, which we are shipping. Coolpad, for example, obviously Vaio, Lenovo and others. I mean, they\u2019re not -- they don\u2019t view their competition to be among other indigenous Chinese. They view the competition to be the big worldwide players of smartphones.", "And so the pressure is to improve the performance of Wi-Fi so the very same dynamic will be to more high performance Wi-Fi, adding more, switching, filtering more, perhaps amplification moving towards ac in some cases.", "There is an ASM play for us in addition to Wi-Fi power amplifying switching. So I think that really we don\u2019t make the distinction of what a China customer maybe looking to ship internally or export versus other big brand. The dynamics are the same and they are competing with one another for the hearts and minds of the very same consumer.", "Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity", "Okay. Thank you and just on a follow-up question for Don. Now that your June quarter guidance is very close to your $0.75 longer term target with seasonal trends in September, you could be above those levels. Any longer term milestones maybe we should think about from modeling given the new size of the business. And then just on the previous question, were there any supply constraints in TDLP that might have impact you on the short term? Thanks.", "Don Palette", "Yeah. Mike, on the performance and going out to September as it relates to a model. We\u2019re obviously very close to achieving the mid-term model we\u2019ve being talking about for over the past year. We just guided $535 million revenue and $0.73 so that\u2019s obviously knocking on the door for $0.75. Its too early for us to really give any formal view what\u2019s beyond the mid-term model.", "But one thing I can tell you as you\u2019re stepping back in modeling the business, we would expect a lot of the dynamics, business dynamics to play out beyond that $0.75 per quarter, the same as you saw building after that, so gross margin expansion of 48% to 50% and there\u2019s clearly going to be operating leverages as we move forward. So that\u2019s the best way to think about our business that you add revenue going forward.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.", "Craig Ellis - B. Riley", "Thanks for taking the question and guys congratulations on what appears to be two milestones, both the dividend initiation and what I think is record gross margins in the outlook. My question first is on the vertical markets business and it\u2019s a short term and intermediate term question. As we look at the progress that you\u2019re making and there were seven different applications identified in the press release that you penetrated with those initiatives. Where are we in the build out of the vertical markets program? Are we in the second inning, the fifth inning, the eight inning, can you put recent progress in perspective points?", "Don Palette", "What I love about the vertical markets obviously and we have been talking about it and investing for, we started moving from infrastructure into smart energy and then into the connected home and so on and so forth. We got a couple of acquisitions which gave much bigger target rich environment, probably six or seven years now in fact. So what I like about it is while there isn\u2019t any one individual stock that they could drive huge amounts of revenue like you might see in the smartphone or tablet.", "But we have been very successful in creating system design team that we\u2019re very closely with our customers in the field, phone applications approach and being able to identify where we can serve that set of customers. Well, the customer differentiated products that will last throughout multiple product cycles, long product life cycles very margin accretive. And I must say that we\u2019re very much on track to our strategic plan in long range to continue to do that.", "And we continue to grow sequentially in helping our margins that reducing our volatility which make us a much stronger, broader company. I would say, we are in a very early stages because as the price points of this technology have gotten more affordable. And as consumers have become more use to the technology and as our device manufactures are creating more intuitive easy to use devices, its starting to continue penetrate more and more markets and today its just a astounding the array of products we're working with our customers on. All trying to figure out how to remain connected, do it at the right budget and at the right level of user ease.", "Craig Ellis - B. Riley", "So the follow-up would be related to that, what percent of revenue is vertical markets currently in and where would it potentially go over a two to three-year period?", "Dave Aldrich", "", "Today it\u2019s about 27% as Don mentioned in the prepared comments. And I think that the combination of vertical markets as well as those analog products going into some of our mobile customers platform like GPS, like Wi-Fi, I think that grows much faster than our PA revenue, PA business which is good to the overall returns of the business.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Please go ahead.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity", "Thank you. Couple here, first off on SkyOne. We understand the platforms of both Samsung and Apple are moving toward, its seems like the end game on that is going to something like SkyOne. They\u2019re not there yet but certainly seems to be direction everybody is moving into.", "First, is SkyOne material today to revenue, we talking 1%, 5%, 10% or is this more of a test year for where people are trying it out. And then we could expect much more material growth in say 2014 as maybe the top OEMs move more to that what kind of occupation given the complexity of the LTE. Thanks guys.", "Don Palette", "Yeah. It is material, it is not yet 5% but it\u2019s getting close. But remember it\u2019s in early stage of ramp and the ASP is very high. So the customers are launching, they are actually quite big. So I think its going to be very significant and it will be significant, more significant in the second half than it was in the first half. In 2015 we expect to be a big SkyOne here but keep in mind that it is a platform. So SkyOne will take on many different shapes and forms as our customers get comfortable with the technology and comfortable with allowing us supply our partner to architect the entire front end.", "That\u2019s being a little bit of a learning curve. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve needed to work very closely with our customers to get them comfortable with because they give up a lot of control in favor of the user views. And we\u2019re having a lot of success with that was not fast.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity", "Don, as a follow-up, I was little confused by the answer to the last question. You said verticals are probably around just under 30%. Your largest customer was well over 30% last year. Is that break obviously out between horizontal and verticals markets you looking at definitional thing there. And the larger question you\u2019ve done exceedingly well on Wi-Fi, it seems to be continue to be a growth engine here. Is Wi-Fi spread between all three of your [Technical Difficulty] integrated mobile systems in broad markets or is it more concentrated heavily more on those? Thanks.", "Don Palette", "Pulled it back to broad market number as Dave said and we said the program mark is 27%. And our top customer last year was in mid 30s or little above that and -- but that the revenue for the customers across multiple revenue areas, they can be a mobile, they can be in broad markets as well, so it\u2019s mixed.", "Dave Aldrich", "", "I think, what you\u2019re getting that there is no Wi-Fi that winds up in a smartphone or tablet that we are including in that 27%, that is all non-mobile broad market.", "Operator", "Suji De Silva with Topeka. Please go ahead.", "Suji De Silva - Topeka", "Hi guys, nice job on the quarter. Thanks for breaking out the pre-segment here. Can you talk about the relative margins of each either qualitatively or I think we can and what do you expect the core PA business to grow longer term versus the other business?", "Don Palette", "As we talked about, the initial presentation, the relative margins for the PAs are in low 40 is slightly below what the corporate average is. Integrated mobile is slightly above that that and our best margins in the broad market. But understand within each of that their products that there is some variability on that, those are averages within those categories.", "Suji De Silva - Topeka", "Thanks. And on the PA segment, I think the growth there can be versus the other ones which is clearly going faster?", "Don Palette", "I think the PA business is going to grow in revenue dollars shrink as a percentage. I would put a 5 percentage growth rate in PA dollars, which will be materially less than the growth rate of the company therefore and it has been trending for the last few years, it will get smaller but will remain meaningful.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.", "Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee", "Hi guys. Congratulations again.", "Dave Aldrich", "Thanks Vijay.", "Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee", "As for the quarter and you might have answered this question already, but if you look at the second half and you look at the tier one marquee phones, how do you see about your share in those going to second half?", "Dave Aldrich", "I think -- I believe that two things are going to happen. One is industry dynamic in the second half in 2015 and 2016, as the content will go up. The number of bands that are being added, the amount of functionality around higher performance connectivity and what we see our customers trying to do with the intend or improved current consumptions using things like carrier aggregation and sophisticated tooling techniques. It is no doubt in our mind that content over the next several years is going to go up.", "And I am -- as we engage our customers today, I am really pleased with the fact that our technology offering is unique. We are engaging at the system level early in the customer\u2019s decisions as to which SOC they are going to use which and so on. And they will really able to have a system level conversation not a component conversation. So, I am absolutely convinced that the TAM overall in the industry is going to go up and that we are going to continue to gain share.", "Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee", "Right. And just housekeeping question here, did you add any 10% customers in the quarter here and keep it up, guys? Thanks.", "Don Palette", "Yeah. Thanks Vijay. We had two, 10% Foxconn and Samsung.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Mike Burton with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "", "Mike Burton - Brean Capital", "Hey, guys. Congratulations on the great quarter and guide. Don, if I could just on the margin side that you mentioned the 48% to 50% contribution margin going forward. But I'm wondering on OpEx expectations into next year, can we stay in the kind of the mid to high 80 tier or would we expect that pick up as IoT and that the broader markets become a bigger portion of the mix?", "Don Palette", "Yeah, I mean the increases that you've seen and guided as, the majority of the increase is on the R&D line and it's some target investments that we're making to support new growth opportunities and quite frankly we are saying the benefits of these initiatives in topline out performance. We're going to -- we are expecting to continue to see strong leverage, so we expect the revenue growth will be well ahead of the OpEx growth and that leverage is a key component of continuing to drive improved returns.", "Remember in the June guide, we have a merit increase, solid merit increase mid-year so that's in the number as well. On going forward, that number is going to continue to ramp some as revenue grows and investment grow. So as far as what you model next year, I think by the time you get to mid-year when you have another merit increase to that number is going to be high-80s and the 90s kind of number for sure. But there is some incremental investment every quarter in way that we model it.", "Mike Burton - Brean Capital", "Thank you. That is helpful. And then, Dave, a few comment on bulk for a second. Do you have any concerns with the RFMD or TriQuint merger as a potential supplier or borrower, or are you still comfortable with the bar available to you from the non-domestic suppliers and have you actually started to shift some of the bar into any SkyOne platform or any other modules so far this year?", "Dave Aldrich", "The answer to latter question is yes. And I am actually extremely comfortable with it and the reason is that today, we're participating in filters more broadly than any competitors in power profile duplexes in SkyOne and in most of our GPS modules in fact. And the more we engage with the filter ecosystem, more convinced I am that there is no one side that's all. We are seeing the vast majority of bands using some form of saw and with more narrow band spacing at an higher frequency, we're having a lot of success using a temperature compensated saw and we are shipping both and there are limited number of bands with very high frequency and type spacing, type frequency spacing the benefit from bulk device if there are or some other bulk acoustic device.", "And our strategy is to be flexible. It is to work with our filter partners on a foundry level and to really get involved in the packaging and the design to make sure we are hitting performance and we match it to our PA or we match it into SkyOne. It gives the absolute best possible performance. And if you look at recent teardowns, I think we are the largest integrator of filters in the world today in fact.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company", "Hey guys. Let me add my congratulations on the results and guidance. Dave, just wondering on the sequential June, you've named a number of factors that are behind that roughly $55 million sequential increase. Can you give us some sense is it fairly broad-based or is the LTE opportunity in China at emerging market just given the content in LTE phone, would that be the single biggest factor accounted for that $55 million increase and then I have a quick follow-up?", "Dave Palette", "Yeah. I think the biggest single factor would be -- although, I\u2019ve got to say, it is really very broad, but the biggest single factor would be in content games within mobile devices when we talked about our integrated mobile systems. So our ability to release successive design suite and much more dollar content than the traditional PA and switch is a big driver of this. And we're applying much of that in China, but a lot into Central America. We have customers doing very well in India and some of the brands that are not Chinese brands are doing extremely well, penetrating emerging markets with our technology. So that is a big -- that is going to be indeed a big piece of it.", "The 802, the Wi-Fi component of our business in the connected home and within ac rollout of the enterprise, within the home and then as well as into our mobile customers upgraded ac or upgrading to more bands MIMO, that's a big driver. We're seeing that as well. We're seeing it not only in the home we're seeing in verticals, we're seeing in the mobile. And SkyOne is a nice top force as well with very margin rich high dollar content.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company", "Great. And then just on a follow-up on TriQuint, RFMD in there sort of synergy discussions, so they don't anticipate any revenue this synergies. I was wondering if you might comment on opportunities you see as those come together where you might have opportunities to either pick up sockets or perhaps as they shut down in fact, we may have to translate products? Are there opportunities for you to coming as an alternative source of supply? Thanks.", "Don Palette", "Having done mergers and a couple of sizable ones, I mean they are, they take a lot of time, they take a lot of resources and a lot of focus. But I will say this that when we look at our business and our guidance in our 2014, 2015 plan, it has nothing to do with the notion of competitor having struggled or becoming defocused. It's all about ducktailing into trends of the market where our customers just need more help and more technology breadth to solve these phony analog problems and that's what we do, that's what we wake up everyday trying to do and do it better than our competitors. But more importantly do it in a way that we add value to our customers and they're willing to pay us for it.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays", "Thanks and I will echo strong quarter guys. Going back to just the emerging markets. Maybe just looking at your view of the entire market, I know the China mobile, it's still not a 100 million units given the builts that you have shift to and are looking at for June, what's your sense of just how big that market is so far in the first half?", "Dave Aldrich", "Yeah. Blayne, without getting into all of the details so our care specific details, we certainly see a ramp in China, I know the ramp as Dave alluded, we also see emerging markets in general being a content and a unit driver for us and includes Latin America and India. The good news for Skyworks is that we've been very well positioned with all the leading players that enabled. There is companies like MediaTek, like Broadcom, like Qualcomm like Marvel.", "So we have our best hedge very, very nicely with all those players. The content is MMMB solutions, its switching, its power management. GPS is a real nice analog switch that ramps around our mobile. But it's also tether with the leading basement provider, so wherever they win, we're going to be attached. We're seeing in China. We're seeing in emerging markets and we think it is all unique in this ramp.", "Don Palette", "Unlike 2G, or even 3G upgrade cycles in early smartphones, they have made in 2G base. They were EDGE based. The difference we're seeing today in the system performance requirements that this class of customer is requiring and it is very much competition on the world stage. So we are not seeing the small component companies with the threat of lowering price with albeit inferior products being able to penetrate this customer set. It\u2019s not working in this architecture, the technology doesn't play and that's very, very good for us and companies like us who can feel a real robust system.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays", "Thanks. And then just on the new breakout. Thanks for providing that. On your slide deck, you talked about integrated mobile having multi-band pads. Does that inclusive of single band pads as well just a clarification and then you can talk about in broad market, maybe rank some of the bigger end markets I am assuming Wi-Fi is probably the biggest but any clarity there would be helpful.", "Don Palette", "Yeah, playing on the pads, the pad devices would be included in IMS integrated but we only have a single pad. I mean, they attend to be multi-band, couple of filters, multi-mode, multi-band PA. So there is really no instances where we have a single pad with one filter. But those solutions do get included in IMS.", "Operator", "Next question comes from JoAnne Feeney with ABR. Please go ahead.", "JoAnne Feeney - ABR", "Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and a nice outlook. I had a question about a quick follow-up on another question about the timing issued for the year. In the past there have been instances where you have shift components that have been assembled into modules by partners. It sounds like this year that is not something, that's a big components of your business. Can you just clarify that more broadly? I believe the earlier question was more specifically to Wi-Fi?", "Dave Aldrich", "I think that the -- the question is, are we in June benefiting from big program ramps by shipping in the module manufacturer, be it Wi-Fi or something else. And the answer to that is no.", "JoAnne Feeney - ABR", "And so we wouldn't expect an earlier declining of business because of that timing emptiness?", "Dave Aldrich", "Absolutely not, in fact -- absolutely not in fact, I expect, given what I'm seeing in the second half of the calendar year to be seasonally up and really quite strong for us.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Tom Sepenzis with Northland. Please go ahead.", "Tom Sepenzis - Northland", "Hi, congratulations as well for me. I'm just wondering, if you could talk a little bit more about ac specifically as we go from 1 to 2, 2 by 2, 4 to 6 MIMO, what do you -- how you are thinking about the potential TAM benefit there?", "Dave Aldrich", "Sure. That is a -- it's a great question and you've seen some recent releases from some of our chipset partners that are really demonstrating MIMO to 3, 6, even 9 streams. I mean, you literally get a -- if you go from 3 streams to 6, its 2x content for us. And we start with very high content, we can double it, we can triple it and you will able to see some routers and access points now that have substantial Skyworks content 11ac FEMs, switching and even power management in some cases.", "So this is deployed very well in routers. But again as I mentioned, we're starting to see mobile handsets adopt 2-by-2 technology on next generation platform, so that would be two streams in the mobile handsets, potentially 2.5 gig devices, 2.4 gig devices together with switching. So that trend is really good and by the way, the benefits that when we see on delivering this higher data rates through the home, delivering these higher rates to handheld the tablet or mobile device are outstanding. So it's a win-win for the customers and we're in a great position to capitalize.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Richard Sewell - Stephens", "Yeah guys, thanks. This is Richard in for Harsh. Let me pass along my congratulations as well.", "Dave Aldrich", "Thank you.", "Richard Sewell - Stephens", "So my first question. Can you give any color on how your visibility compares to prior years and how the lead times in the integrated solutions compare to discrete PA?", "Dave Aldrich", "The visibility is as good if not better and I would say better in the sense that the -- that we\u2019re participating earlier in the product lifecycle in almost all cases. In fact, we're beginning to participate at the point at which the overall SOC or chipset has been selected. So we have much more visibility. In fact, we're looking now at products that will be launching in the second half. We're well into designing late 50 and some cases 60 products today. Because the architecture choices among our customers differ and some other product lifecycles at vertical markets are very, very low, in fact, most of them are.", "And so we're doing some connectivity enablement upfront. And so our customers -- these new customers are coming to us and we're helping to figure out how to deal with these phone analog connectivity problems for the very first and they're engaging us right upfront. So the visibility today, I would have to say in general is better.", "Richard Sewell - Stephens", "Great. And then a quick follow-on, we're seeing a couple of year peers launch integrated solutions. What do you think driving a more integrated solutions approach across the industry?", "Dave Aldrich", "I think it's quite simple and that is in order for our customers to meet their performance requirements, their design time to market -- and to just reduce their need to get into the detail of architecture as these comps -- as these analog systems become more and more complex. They're looking for a partner and that partner has to have system expertise and partners has to have good solid manufacturing capability to do unique things, bumping, flipping, diving and a broad product portfolio. And so we've been a leader in integration. We were in front in FEMs, we're upfront with Pads, we're upfront in SkyOne, we're upfront in WiFi and integration of devices and we think that's a big, big advantage for us and the trends that I think we'll not stop for many years.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "Dave Aldrich", "Okay. Well, thank you very much everybody for participating and I look forward to see you in upcoming conferences.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation with GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Skyworks delivered very strong financial results again in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, exceeding our upwardly revised guidance. I'm proud of our achievements during the quarter and particularly pleased with the broad-based strength in demand. Our continuing outperformance reflects the sound underlying industry trends in our served markets and underscores the effectiveness of our diversification strategy and our execution.", "At a high level, our business results are being fueled by a surge in global adoption of connectivity in all its forms across a diverse set of end markets. We are riding a wave of powerful underlying market forces, all enabled by the availability of efficient, high-performance connectivity solutions.", "Among these are: The enabling of billions of unconnected users with the first time Internet access in the emerging economies; advancing new forms of content delivery, such as streaming music services, on-demand media and over-the-content distribution; supporting cloud services and mobile e-commerce; and fueling the growth of the Internet of Things.", "All of these megatrends are in their early stages, and Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize, leveraging a broad portfolio of specialized technologies, advanced system integration capabilities and unmatched operational efficiency. These core competencies enable us to deliver differentiated, customized solutions translating directly into superior financial returns for the company.", "During the quarter, we generated revenue of $587 million. That's up 35% year-over-year and ahead of our updated guidance of $570 million. We produced operating income of $179 million, that's up 60% from a year ago.", "We posted operating margins of 30.5%, surpassing the mid-term target profitability model we set in fiscal 2013. We produced EPS of $0.83, that's up 54% versus a year ago, and we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share. And finally, we guided to $1 of earnings per share for the fourth quarter.", "By all measures, Q3 was an outstanding quarter, and we see our momentum continuing. I'll provide more color on some of our specific growth opportunities later in the call. But now I'll turn it over to Don for a more in-depth review of our financial results and our outlook.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks, Dave, and thanks again for joining us, everyone. Revenue for the third quarter was $587 million, ahead of our upwardly revised outlook, and up 34.6% versus the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $266.6 million or 45.4% of revenue, and that's 140 basis point increase from the year-ago quarter. The upside to guidance was driven by the better-than-expected top line contribution, coupled with strength in our integrated systems solutions portfolio.", "Operating expenses were $87.5 million, consisting of R&D expense of $53.8 million and SG&A expense of $33.7 million. We generated $179.1 million of operating income, yielding a 30.5% operating margin. That represents a 480 basis point increase versus the year-ago quarter.", "Operating profits were up 60% year-on-year as we leveraged operating expenses, reaped the benefits of recent capital investments and continued to expand our margin-enhancing custom integrated solutions and precision analog products.", "Cash tax rate for the third quarter was 10.2%, producing net income of $160.8 million or $0.83 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.03 better than our updated guidance.", "Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Generated $199 million in cash flow from operations, invested $68 million in capital expenditures in support of upcoming demand forecast, and the majority of that was deployed to expand our assembly and test capabilities. Depreciation was $24 million.", "We repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock during the quarter, representing a $41 million investment. Our share repurchases reflect the confidence we have in our business outlook, which we believe represents a highly attractive use of cash. And finally, we exited the quarter with $893 million in cash and no debt.", "For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, power amplifiers represented 41% of revenue; integrated mobile systems was 33%; and broad markets was 26%, and that's roughly in line with the percentages from the first half of 2014. It's worth noting that these percentages can fluctuate on a quarterly basis. And as a result, we believe it's more important to focus on longer-term directional trends in these categories.", "Turning to our fourth quarter business outlook. Based on our backlog, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between $670 million and $900 million, reflecting broad-based strength driven by new product ramps, content gains, growth across the emerging markets, ongoing 802.11ac deployments and expanding set of opportunities within the Internet of Things. At the midpoint of $680 million, we suggest modeling gross margin in the 45.5% to 46% range with operating expenses of approximately $92 million.", "It's worth pointing out that our guidance for the September quarter includes an extra week of operating expenses this year, which is a normal occurrence for us approximately every sixth year on the fiscal calendar. We estimated around $3 million of our fourth quarter operating expense will be attributable to the extra week. Below the line, we anticipate $100,000 in expenses from interest income and other expenses, and a cash tax rate of around 11%.", "Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, we suggest modeling a cash tax rate of around 13%. We expect share counts to be around 194.5 million shares, resulting in fourth quarter EPS of $1 at the mid-point of the revenue range.", "Our EPS guidance represents a 56% year-over-year increase and the sixth consecutive quarter above 20% year-over-year earnings growth, reflecting sustained strength and demand for our products, our differentiation in the marketplace and the consistency of our execution.", "We remain on track to close our joint venture with Panasonic before the end of the fiscal year. Post-close, Skyworks will own a controlling interest in the performance leader and TC SAW filters with cumulative shipments approaching 0.25 billion units. We expect the venture to broaden our technology portfolio, further enrich our systems capabilities and enhance our financial returns. And just as a reminder, we anticipate the transaction will provide at least 100 basis points of gross margin accretion in fiscal 2015.", "We continue to see tremendous earnings potential ahead. We expect the combination of above-market top line growth, gross margin expansion and earnings leverage to fuel continued outperformance in our financials, putting us on a path of $5 in annualized EPS over the next couple of years. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on the market.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks, Don. So to put the strength of our recent results into a broader context, I'd like to spend just a few minutes addressing one of the key questions that we often hear from investors: What are the specific factors powering our accelerating growth and expanding profitability, and more importantly, can they continue? Well, at a high level, we see a powerful combination of content gains, new market penetration and share consolidation fueling our performance. In fact, we're actively engaged right now in architecting platforms for deployment in 2015 and '16, which provide us with a unique vantage point into the market dynamics that will fuel our growth over the years to come.", "To be more specific, starting with the mobile market, we see 3 key drivers. First, the number of operating frequencies is trending higher. In support of improved service coverage and higher data rates, we see band content continuing to rise across high-end mid-tier and entry level 4G LTE devices. This drives greater addressable content throughout our entire product lines. Second, system complexity continues to rise. The combined impact of band proliferation and the adoption of sophisticated new techniques, including advanced antenna architectures, carrier aggregation, tuning and filtering, is resulted -- resulting in a rapid shift away from discrete components and is towards more customized and integrated solutions, which sweep in adjacent analog content, and Skyworks is absolutely at the forefront of this transition.", "Third, our addressable content continues to expand. OEMs are increasingly focused on new ways to improve signal quality and download speeds to support seamless access to on-demand content, streaming media and cloud-based services. And this is driving more complex downlink architectures and creating entirely new growth avenues for us in the receive path. In addition, we're continuing to broaden our portfolio of mobile analog products in areas like power management, backlighting and GPS, and are seeing increasing customer contract -- customer traction here.", "Outside of mobile, we also see a number of positive trends. First, data capacity requirements are growing dramatically. Next-generation connectivity standards like 802.11ac with multiple transmit and receive channels drive even higher performance levels, resulting in significant content for Skyworks, not only in routers but also in set-top boxes. We see it in media gateways, network storage devices and other high-performance networking applications.", "Second, connectivity is expanding into brand-new device categories. These include wearable electronics, fitness and wellness applications, and new opportunities within the Connected Home like lighting, like security and automation. These all serve to enhance our diversification by providing new incremental growth avenues for Skyworks.", "And finally, our vertical market penetration is increasing. We've spent the last decade investing significant resources and leveraging our technology to expand our presence in traditional analog markets like automotive, medical and industrial. We have established significant traction in these higher-margin growth avenues, and we see tremendous opportunity ahead.", "It's worth noting that the growing -- the growth of our precision analog business has kept pace with the strong growth in our mobile segment over the last few years. And I think equally important is our ability to convert these strong top line growth trends into superior financial returns. Over the last few years, we've established a solid track record of doing so, significantly outperforming the analog semiconductor market by all measures.", "Since 2010, we've more than doubled our revenue. We've expanded profit margins by over 600 basis points, and we've surpassed our 30% operating margin. We've grown earnings per share at a 25% compounded rate, and we've consistently posted over 20% returns on invested capital. These metrics are a testament not only to our execution and the inherent operational efficiency of our flexible business model, but also to our growing statue within the overall value chain as customers recognized that connectivity has become a key factor in defining the overall user experience.", "We see all of these drivers creating an addressable market that is growing at least at the mid-teens pace which, when combined with the earnings leverage in our business model, result in significant earnings power over the next 2 to 3 years.", "Hopefully, our call today and these comments has provided a better sense of the positive underlying drivers for our business and why we have such high confidence in our prospects for 2015 and beyond.", "Okay. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I just had a couple of questions. First, I guess, is you're coming off of a very big June quarter. Now we're looking at a another great big September quarter. I know it's broad based, but can you just highlight the top 2 or 3, 1 or 2 upside drivers there? And part of that question, too, is should we assume, as we look into the December quarter, that we revert to sort of a more normal seasonal pattern for you guys? Or some of those mega trends that you mentioned, Dave, and something changed fundamentally? Have we kind of shifted to the sort of a higher growth pattern for the foreseeable? That's my first question.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you very -- great question. Well, first of all, I am delighted to see that this strength is very broad based. We're seeing it in all of our business segments today. Probably the biggest driver is an uptake in the content-rich integrated mobile systems. We provided that split for you a couple of quarters ago. We're seeing a lot of growth there, and it's a direct result of architectures getting much more complex. We've also seen strong growth in our broad markets business. I think mentioned it, I don't think it's no small feat that we've been growing the broad market business as fast as we've been growing mobile, and that really says something in this industry. And it's being driven by 802.11ac deployments, new vertical market opportunities, we call it IOT, but there are a slew of them, and we've got a strong foothold and they continue to grow. And just -- as a marker, our broad markets portfolio year-to-date is up 26%. And we do see success within one of our largest customers by adding content in some flagship models.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And so, Dave, that leads you to my second question. I don't know how much color you can give us on this, but you guys have obviously been capitalizing on that trend for greater RF complexity content. Can you give us any color or any sense how much of that growth with your -- one of your or your biggest customers is coming from, just units looking better versus your guys' increased content there?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I would say across the board that when we look at high-end smartphones and even entry-level smartphones in markets like China, we're seeing a dramatic uptake in the analog content, that we call integrated mobile systems. We're sweeping in more and more GPS, very complex, switching architectures using Silicon-on-Insulator. The transmit chain is becoming more complicated, carrier aggregation is adding more switch content, and we're doing a really nice job with our power lighting and display products. We're seeing display drivers, we're seeing camera flash devices for -- and so I think it's really much more the latter, which is just continuing to see this increase in complexity driving our business. And we are truly the only player out there today that can wrap all that functionality either into an MCM or some IC level. We're quite unique, and that's why we're taking share.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Just to follow on to that question, just to -- I don't think I heard the answer on the seasonal trends you expect into the December quarter given the very strong results, and one of your customers, it sounds like, is in a big ramp here into their new product launches. Just how should we think about normal -- or seasonal trends into the December quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I guess, let me reiterate, our growth is not being driven by any single OEM or any single platform. It's quite broad-based, and it's a little early to talk about December, but I see nothing to deter us from thinking the December will be another up quarter and that the market will be strong and will be stronger than the market, and that's been relatively consistent for us. These underlying trends will continue in December and beyond.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then, just a question on the model -- and congratulations for blowing through the targets you set 2 years ago, and now it's a $5 annual run rate target. Don, can you just help us think on modeling what was the time horizon for maybe the $5 run rate and is the 13% tax rate what we should think about for the next couple of years as you go towards that target?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Mike it is. And as you model us going forward, you can expect a lot of the same dynamics that we've talked about in the model over the last couple of years. I mean, it's all based on the top line growth opportunity, so that's -- and you start with those assumptions. And the gross margin will continue depending on what level of revenue growth, you'll drop the margin to 49%. We're going to continue to see operating leverage. And the goal of $5 in annualized EPS, if you take it off of the $680 million that we just guided, it's going to require -- and you do modest increases in the OpEx on a quarterly basis because we'll continue to make some investments. It will require growth of about 20% to 25%. That's the best way to think about it. And if you do that, you can run different scenarios and get a feel for the time frame.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Dave, I know you gave a very good overview of the content expansion story of -- at Skyworks. I think there has been some concern about the China market, perhaps, an overbuild of LTE. And I know you mentioned that your growth is not just one market, that it's more broad-based. But have you seen any overbuild of LTE in that particular market? And for you to report an up quarter in December, is it necessary for that specific market to grow very fast?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, Vivek, I would say, if I look at the big picture, we are in the early days of a very large upgrade cycle that's going to be multi-years within China, and we've been talking about this opportunity for a long time. Just a couple of interesting statistics. There are over 1 billion mobile subscribers in China, and over half of them still use 2G. And of course, we benefit tremendously from content gains as 2G goes to 3G, and we benefit again at 4G and with the smartphone. And as you know, we're well positioned there. We've got terrific relationships with all of the leading baseband providers there, and we are adding in a lot -- analog content just as we are elsewhere. That being said, there will be winners and losers among the device OEMs, that's for sure. And as we've seen over the years in the past, we find that we need to really handicap our demand forecast. We've got a good track record of doing that. We take a conservative approach when we factor it into our outlook, and we're quite comfortable where we are today, but you raised a good point on the risk of over driving in some -- with some customers.", "Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "All right. And I had a question not on fundamentals but on the stock. It's obviously done very well. But I'm amazed that it's really being driven more by a very solid earnings growth and there hasn't been as much P/E multiple expansion. Why is that? And what can you do to help expand the P/E multiple in the stock?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, that's an interesting question coming from an analyst. I think what we can do is consistently meet or exceed our guidance and try to be as transparent as we possibly can of what's driving the growth, and it's been long term for us. We take a very long-term strategic view of our business, and we think we're positioned extremely well. I don't think we've ever been positioned as well as we are today for the long term.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Harsh Kumar with Stephens Inc.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Dave, I wanted to ask you a question. Towards the end of your comment, you mentioned you see, if I'm correct, a mid-teens industry growth for the parts and pieces of semi business that you play in. I'm curious why you don't think it's a higher growth sector? You just put up tremendous numbers. You're probably solidly in the 20% plus range for growth, teens the year before. Why is that number not higher?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think it could be higher, but I think you ought to think about it as being in that range. But I absolutely -- I fully believe you could be right, it could be higher.", "Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then, Dave, a lot of people have already asked about where the strength is coming from. Let me ask you a different question. You are very optimistic about the Internet of Things. Is there any piece you feel that you're missing whether it's the computing piece or some other area that you feel like there's a hole in your portfolio to adequately go out and capture that market?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I'll let Liam help me with that one. We've done -- we're reasonably happy with the content we've been able to add. It is broad. It's broad in the competition. But there are some pieces that we'd like to add to the portfolio. We are investing in sensors. We're investing in advanced switch architectures, and so we continue to push very hard into new areas that we think leverage our system capability and analog.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. And as a follow on, and the IOT story is really early innings. And we are very well positioned with some of our core technologies, our 802.11 technology, our ZigBee technology, some of our advanced switching. And even packaging is important now as you look at these size-reduced applications. So we like our position within IOT, but we're very keen on expanding our footprint either organically or through some partnerships.", "Operator", "We have a question from Suji De Silva with Topeka.", "Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "First of all, a couple of months since 2 of your larger competitors merged. I wanted to know if anecdotally you've seen any changes in the environment in terms of the design wins behavior and so forth? Or if nothing has really happened yet material?", "David J. Aldrich", "No. The short answer is no. I believe -- we've said in the last quarter, I think consolidation is very healthy for our industry particularly when -- along competitors that have excess capacity. It's just not healthy to have empty fabs, and so we're really happy to see it. But the fact remains that there are fewer and fewer competitors with the capabilities to deal with the system requirements that our customers are asking for today. So I think you're going to see more consolidation coming. The component of supply chain that had been popular in this business just doesn't work anymore. And I guess, I'd end it with we've done big mergers and they take a lot of time, resources and focus. So I think it's a good question.", "Sujeeva De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then question for Don, perhaps. I know you guys just introduced the dividend, but can you talk about what's your kind of metrics are for -- if you would increase that, how you'd think about the payout ratio and so forth?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, I mean, we're constantly looking at our capital structure. The earnings are strong. We're generating a lot of cash. We've really been focused on that 40% return to shareholders, and we're doing that with the combination of the dividend and share buybacks. We think that's working really well. There's no doubt that as earnings continue to grow, we're going to be looking at increasing the dividend over time. As far as the specifics of what that ratio is, we're not going to get into that, but clearly that is something we're going to do over time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.", "Anthony J. Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "And pretty impressive that you kind of skipped over the $4 target and right onto $5. Two parters. One for Don and one for Liam. Going to make sure Liam is involved. On the $5 annual run rate, Don, what do you think -- in terms of longer-term OpEx, what kind of growth you would need to achieve that $5? And then, if Liam won't mind, maybe you could talk a little bit about SkyOne and kind of recent design activity there.", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, the way to think of the growth rate on the $5, as I said, is it's probably going to take 20% to 25% off of that $680 million, and that's impacted by multiple things. That depends on the year and the tax rate. So we said that approximately to use 13%. If, in fact, it would go beyond the year, it could be a little higher rate of maybe 14%, 14.5%. So dependent on what year you're putting in those growth rates. As far as OpEx, we just guided $92 million. Now $3 million of that is a onetime event because of the calendar, so you'd start with -- that's kind of an $89 million of an expense level. And from that, we're going to have modest growth over time. So you want add $750 million a quarter or a number like that in expenses, 150K, that -- maybe $1 million. But you can run some scenarios and you get a real good feel for when that's achievable.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Tony. And with respect to SkyOne, that continues to be a strategic part of our integrated systems portfolio. We're very pleased today that customers, increasingly, have an appetite for these advanced systems that we bring to market. And the complexity that Dave articulated, it's really going up. So our ability to go in and really take that RF chain, sweep-in filtering, sweep-in power management and provide a customized solution, we're seeing some value there. Also, we've been adding customers. We have 4 customers in production today, 5 or 6 on the hook for new designs going into 2015. We're pleased that we just added Nokia's Lumia suite of smartphones to our list, and we look forward to accelerated growth and continued design wins success in 2015.", "Operator", "We now have a question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "I wanted to come back to the Panasonic announcement and just get your point of view on the benefits of that deal for, one, your technology capabilities. And then related to that, what do you think it does from a TAM expansion or customer expansion standpoint for the business?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, Craig. Well, first of all, we've recognized for years the importance of filters and all flavors. And as Dave mentioned in the past, there really are many different frequencies, many different applications and a variety of filter technologies that can be deployed. For us, today, we love the asset that we're about to require here with Panasonic. It brings surface acoustic wave devices, also temperature compensated SAW devices that truly hit the sweet spot today of some critical frequencies. So what we can do with Panasonic is expand our portfolio; create a footprint for PA, SAW and filtering technologies; immediately lever us back in the design wins that we'll launch in 2015 and beyond; and build out a suite and a platform for us to go further into higher frequencies, more selectivity, higher performance levels with the engineering team and the production capacity that we have there.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "And the follow-up would be for Don related to Panasonic. Once you have Panasonic in house, does it change the way we think about the incremental gross margins on the business as you gain synergies with that capability?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Craig. The 49% we -- before we said, used 48%, so the 49% already incorporates that extra point of margin. And certainly, our goal over time, well, to do better than that, but we're not -- we're suggesting modeling the 49%, but we're always striving to do better than our initial targets for sure.", "Operator", "We have a question from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "I want to -- if my math is correct, your inventory days have fallen to about 55, which is the lowest that I can see in quite some time. Can you reflect upon your ability to meet incremental demand, maybe where you are in terms of capacity utilization and your thinking around how you're going to do your mix of internal, external going forward?", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure, Alex. Yes, it's -- you're looking at days, we look at turns, same thing. But yes, our turns were very, very good this quarter. Part of that is we were getting some really strong demand inputs and we're ramping both our internal capacity and external capacity in the hybrid model as we speak, and we've been working that. So as a result, the inventory that we have, both in the hubs and the inventory that we have on hand, we're building just a little lean this quarter, that will get a little more robust as we move into the September and December quarter because we're ramping the supply chain as we speak. So those numbers are a little higher than they should normally be for us, and we're working through those issues. But at this point, we're working very effectively with the customers in order for them to meet the demand that they have.", "Alex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "And then I know, Dave, you touched on some of the new analog wins and power management wins that are going on. Could we just, conceptually, think about what sort of percentage of your revenue, either this last quarter or going forward, might now be coming from, let's say, non-RF, your core competency and RF areas?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, that would be the integrated mobile systems portfolio, which is everything we kind of -- including SkyOne, GPS, Wi-Fi that is in a smartphone device.", "Donald W. Palette", "It was 33%, which is pretty consistent with what we run in the first half.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just one here on gross margin, you guys have talked about gross margin expansion going forward and you listed some of the drivers, but I was hoping you could go into a little bit more details. Over the next 18 months to 2 years, what are going to be the main elements of the gross margin expansion?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Steve, it's going to continue to be us making select CapEx investments and being able to leverage the hybrid model and making sure that we're keeping the right percentage of internal versus external sourcing, and that gives us the right contribution. And so we do -- day to day, we're doing the blocking and tackling of looking at yields and looking at productivity and what we're spending, working our supply chain. Those were all things that we've done for a long, long period of time that have allowed us to be best in class in this space as far as the margins. But I think the real next step function for us is we're continuing to move the mix into more and more integrated mobile solutions where there's more complexity. Complexity for us drives profitability. And there's fewer and fewer people in the space that can do it, and so as that continues to grow the percent of revenue, it's going to be a nice step function for us as far as margin expansion.", "Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just turning back to SkyOne. So your thoughts on what that could be sort of percentage of revenue may be exiting the calendar year. And then for more complex devices like that exiting 2015, where do you think the industry is in terms of adoption of that? It seems like it's still early days, but I'm just curious, your thoughts there.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Well, the complexity theme actually is accelerating. And we're -- there's a couple of leading OEMs that have forged the path, and you would be surprised to see how this is catching on with a number of customers. So we think the ability to deliver integrated mobile solutions, whether they be SkyOne or derivatives -- I'll also, back to our filter comment, we have a great deal of flexibility now in architecting these customized solutions, not only on the transmit side but also on the receive side of a smartphone. A lot of rich content there. So we think the complexity theme will continue. It's a small portion of the market today. We've been capitalizing, but our position there is outstanding. We have the core technology, we have the switching technology, GPS power, core RF. And then, also weaving in some of our packaging and assembly techniques makes it really special. So we look forward to this upgrade cycle throughout the industry, and it's still quite early.", "David J. Aldrich", "And one thing we've learned, when we first launched SkyOne 1.0, if you will, it was a highly integrated all bands that was intended to hit a swath of the market where companies would look for -- OEMs would look for that a solution, a complete integrated solution. And what we've learned is that doesn't work. What works is a SkyOne architecture that's very reconfigurable and customized. It's really good for our business because we know how to do that, but there isn't anybody out there who seems to have the very same idea as another major OEM in how they want to architect these systems. It's all quite unique.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham.", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "But I just wanted to follow up on that last question. I guess, if we look out at the front end for mobile devices, it seems you've got 2 common architectures. One, sort of the broadband or MMPA; the other is the pad, moving to white band pads. Do you have a viewpoint? Is the industry going to stay diverse? Or do you think one of those architectures wins out over time? And if one of those architectures does win out, are you better positioned from a content perspective one way or the other? And then I got a follow-up for Don.", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I think that the -- if you will look at today, it seems that some form of a power amplifier duplexer or architecture made into a very complex receive set of products, switching and control products, seems to be gaining some traction. I think it's really a hybrid. As I mentioned earlier with SkyOne, what we've seen is SkyOne is very important with some combination of amplifier, duplexer, switching control and logic, and maybe voltage on the front end, maybe antenna tuning on the back end. That's where the architecture wants to go. That can be implemented with PADs, as well as discretes, or with an MMPA, and a couple of PADs, believe it or not, are overlaying some high-performance LTE bands with just a discrete PA. It is not one size fits all. But the trend is more integration and more integration and matching of PAs and filters and more customization on the receive path.", "N. Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then just for Don, just coming back to the dividend buyback policy. You get close to your $5 of EPS target. My quick calculation would say your cash from operations would be something around $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. Is 40% of that going to shareholders the right percentage? Or as you get closer to that $5 target, would you consider increasing the percent of cash flow that might be paid back to shareholders?", "Donald W. Palette", "That was the same question. You said the same thing twice, but I understand the question. Yes, as we continue to grow and as more and more dollar available to us, we're going to look at multiple options. It could continue to be an expansion of the share buyback and dividend expansion. Certainly, as earnings go up, the valuation of the company is going to go up. And if -- we would be looking at a certain yield potentially that would go up. And it's just going to -- we're going to continue to expand. We'll need CapEx dollars. So all of those things we'll do, and we like having enough cash available. We'll also fund anything that potentially happens externally where we want to grow from a nonorganic basis. So it's just a question of managing all those things in concert. And you're right, as the numbers continue to grow, you have different options. The key is -- the key to a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow is it's a competitive advantage. It gives us the strategic advantage, and we like that. So it gives a lot of options.", "Operator", "And next we have Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "If you look at Panasonic here, obviously, it's helping you reduce your cost of the packaging side, but where you see -- do you see incremental market share opportunity either with the SAW or TC SAW as incorporate that?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think the short answer is yes. And first of all, it's integral part of our PADs, our SkyOne and even our GPS modules. As I mentioned earlier on customization, no one size fits all. The majority of bands still use a SAW. There are more and more narrow band spacing where we can provide a great differentiated product with a TC SAW, and Panasonic is a performance and IP leader there, hands down. And we see a limited number of bands where we need to partner for BAW acoustic processes, which we are doing. So we have a complete offering, and I think we're the only company in the world that is offering modules that incorporate SAW, TC SAW and BAW. And so it not only gives us the ability to eliminate margin stacking as we buy filters, we now will produce them, but it also gives us a competitive advantage to move TC SAW into more and more bands.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "And just a housekeeping question here. What is your 3G, 4G mix? And with the strong ramp here in the second [indiscernible], does the PA plus IMS mix versus analog shift quite a bit?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, on the 2G versus 3G, 4G, it really -- that's really not that meaningful of a number for us any moment. The 2G is sub-10%, and the rest of it is 3G, 4G. And as we move forward, yes, we would expect in the September, December quarter that the PA percentage would drop a little bit. That's still going to be growth year-over-year, and the integrated mobile systems would increase in the percentage. We would expand...", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I mean, the analog split would be about the same in broad markets basically.", "Donald W. Palette", "Broad markets would stay about the same percentage.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mike Burton with Brean Capital.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Just to follow up on that last couple of questions on filters and BAW. David, if you could update us, how many suppliers do you currently have that you can get supply for BAW if you do need it. I know it's not something that's been a huge priority for you in the past. And then, as we've seen the shift to 4G in China, are you starting to see the Avagos and TriQuints start to compete in that market, which has really been you and RFMD in the past?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, first, we're getting BAW now from 2 or 3, and I think that list will grow a little bit. I'm sorry, the second part of the question, we're seeing new competitors. You mentioned a couple. We have seen the competitor list within open market China drop dramatically. We used to have 15 competitors for discrete PAs and then other competitors for switches and other competitors for filters. We no longer see that. If you look at the reference design of MediaTek or QUALCOMM or others, you will see 1 or 2 suppliers capable of really capturing the bulk of that analog content. So I didn't think it's -- I think it's not as you have described, Mike. I think it's more the opposite there. And that's where we're gaining. The complexity in all of these smartphones, even the low-end smartphone, is making it impossible, very tough, if not impossible, for component-only companies to compete.", "Michael A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Very helpful. And then just a follow-up on -- there's been a few questions already on the SkyOne. But I'm just wondering, Liam, if you actually -- on the competitive landscape, do you see anything from QUALCOMM or RF Micro at this point? And would you actually view a successful offering from one of those guys actually as something that could actually accelerate that product category and today's point actually consolidate the market even further?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, sure. Well, I mean, certainly QUALCOMM has been in the space for a while. And as David pointed out, with the more preconfigured approach, CMOS driven approach that they featured, there may be some customers that will adopt that. But what we continue to see is performance really mattering now in this industry. It matters a lot. Efficiency matters and GaAs HBT has been critical to that. But we also weave in CMOS and SOI in a lot of our solutions as well. So we have a balance. I think what will happen, and we're seeing it already, and we talked about the market growth and the overall TAM expansion, is that this complexity theme is going up. The appetite for our customers to take upon more complex solutions delivered by OEMs, delivered by suppliers like Skyworks, I think, is there. But we're really not seeing any others offer that. It's a very, very small set of companies that have the architectural leadership, skill set, systems knowledge to deliver to this new hurl within mobile. And we think this hurl is going to continue to go up. Our customers are very pleased with what we've been able to do. And as I mentioned before, the appetite for this type of technology is increasing.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Liam, you mentioned expansion of capabilities especially integrated mobile products once Panasonic is in-house. Other than eliminating the stock margin issue, what can you do with Panasonic in-house that you couldn't do with them externally? Does it suggest that you'd be offering discrete filter products that don't include amplifiers and devices? Or just expands your flexibility in addressing more integrated products?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Well, it does a lot of things. I mean, it certainly does open up a discrete filter opportunity for us, and there's a number of things we can do there. You're quite familiar with the industry. There's products that can address Wi-Fi, there's frequency bands that we could sell discreetly. We fully intend to advance the technology and build platform of filtering capability, center of excellence SAW in Japan. We also get -- back to the core, we have usage within SkyOne, of course, usage within our PADs. And as you know, being able to design and couple your filters under the same roof as your PA team is critical. And that's an advantage. And then on the receive side, if you look at some of these diversity FEMS that we see with LNA and switch and many, many filters, that's a whole new opportunity for us to address. We've had some wins, but having a filter technology in-house is really going to accelerate our hit right there. So there's many, many ways to play Panasonic. Immediately, we see filling modules that we've already progressed on, but we see an opportunity to expand as I outlined.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Because in terms of TC SAW -- in terms of high-performance TC SAW, it's really only Panasonic and TriQuint. And TriQuint is probably going to be a bit distracted if you're coming here pretty quickly. So if you win in discrete market, it would seem like an opportunity that you could capitalize on given the shortage on this along...", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes. No, that is right. And as I said, I mean, our goal is to try to move that forward into some of the higher frequencies, and we found, in many cases, appropriately designed TC SAW can take the space of BAW and perhaps even FBAR eventually.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Cody Acree with Ascendiant Capital.", "Cody G. Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And maybe, Liam, just following up on that, does that then eliminate any real thought of progressing your -- the Panasonic technology into BAW filters, And do you think you can manage everything you need with TC SAW?", "Liam K. Griffin", "No, we will keep an open mind to that. I mean, our goal is to leverage the platform. We have a great group of engineers that come with us in this JV. We've been adding designers, filter designers ourselves. We have incredible insight on how the power amplifier filter and the system works together. So our role here is to advance the technology at Panasonic. We'll take advantage of the IP. We'll continue to have partners as well to ensure that we have the best possible solution.", "Cody G. Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "How long might it be before you think you could advance to the tech to include BAW?", "Liam K. Griffin", "I think we could put the equivalent performance through Panasonic within the next 12 months.", "Operator", "Our next question is from JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment.", "JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC", "If we go back to the revised guidance in early June and we look where we ended up now, what would you say made it challenging to be more aggressive when you made that revision? What changed in the month of June? Was there anything specifically? Was it something about which you have less visibility typically than other things? And then, how does that play into the guidance for this quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "JoAnne, I'm not sure I understand. Are you asking why -- what happened to cause us to exceed the revised guidance? Or was there some other question?", "JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC", "Why wasn't it more predictable?", "David J. Aldrich", "Why wasn't the revision more predictable?", "JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC", "No, why wasn't the result after the revision something you were able to predict in June? Was the quarter more back-end loaded than usual? What changed basically?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, we exceeded the revised guidance, but I think we exceeded it by a reasonable amount. So not that much change. I think we remain conservative whenever we provide an outlook, and things just happen more right than the opposite. That's all. It wasn't a huge difference.", "Donald W. Palette", "No, and from the original guidance to the updated guidance, we knew there was a potential for some improvement, but we needed some things to materialize before we were going to do that. That's really all it was.", "JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then on the cost front, you said you knew -- you've asked your foundries, it sounded like to step up production. What are you seeing by the way of pricing from the foundries? There's still certainly some excess capacity out there. Has the pricing environment changed very much? And with the pricing declines, if you're seeing them keep up with any component price declines that you might be facing?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. Yes, I mean, we have great relationships with our partners, our outside partners, foundries, et cetera; and they're pleased to see our demand. We haven't seen anything out of the ordinary on the pricing. We continue to work negotiations into 2015. And the fact that we have been driving a lot of results through our OEMs have put us in a very good position for those discussions.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.", "Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Two, if I could. First, on the broad markets. You said it should be a similar percentage. Just curious because a lot of the highlights for the quarter that you talked about in the press release were non-mobile. So I'm just curious on that business. How important is the 3G versus Wi-Fi for that segment of the business? And then, the second question, just going back to China. I love the perspective on impacts of 2 things. One, being the potential for more 3-mode now than 5-mode; and on the other side, more of an opportunity to talk about the other carriers getting FDD licenses, what do you think that could mean for that important end market?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure. On the broad market piece, you asked about 3G and Wi-Fi. For us, broad market doesn't include any 3G. There's no cellular technology. So broad market for us is our advanced analog capabilities. It's PM, it's SOI switching, ZigBee, some Wi-Fi. And in that space, we have been growing. As we noted, 26% year-over-year, a number of end applications, some that we noted in the highlights from very creative IOT devices like Sonos [ph] high-def audio to Nest Thermostat's automotive opportunities, et cetera. There's a whole host of things. Networking and routers are all big parts of that story. And with respect to China, you had question on 3-mode and 5-mode. Yes, I mean, we monitor that split. And it's quite interesting because if you step back, and as David pointed out, half of that market or more than half is 2G. So a move to 3-mode is substantial, a move to 5-mode is perhaps even more substantial for us. But also remember, if you see more of a swing back to the 3-mode phone, where they drop FTE and WCDMA, they're typically sold at lower price points. So there could be a volume benefit to us there as well. But in any case, the China upgrade cycle is going to be substantial for us. We're starting to see a little bit of that now. 4G is a little bit late. It's back into our numbers, but multiple bands, multiples switching, a lot of content games will certainly be on the horizon.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Tom Sepenzis with Northland Capital.", "Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division", "I think most of it has been asked at this point. But I'm just curious with QUALCOMM buying Wilocity, have you done any work at 60 gigahertz? Is that a market that you're thinking of going after for 60 gigahertz Wi-Fi?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Yes, I mean, we've monitored that. We're a pretty substantial player in Wi-Fi. We work with QUALCOMM, we work with Broadcom and a number of the other players. We haven't done anything specifically there, but we are evaluating next leg technologies and certainly expect this to be a big part of our story for years.", "Thomas A. Sepenzis - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division", "Do have any sense of the timing on when you think that will actually become a thing?", "Liam K. Griffin", "The 60-gig standard, no, I don't have any specific timeline for that.", "David J. Aldrich", "We predict it to be around the corner for about 8 years.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, thank you, everyone, for participating today, and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences.", "Operator", "Thank you, then. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Stephen Ferranti, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti", "Thank you, Rochelle. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' First Fiscal Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Joining me today are David Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We'll then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected, as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time-to-time in our SEC filings. I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thanks Steve and welcome everyone. Well we are off to a great start to fiscal 2015 with first quarter revenue, profitability, and earnings all exceeding our guidance driven by strong demand across our served markets and increasing adoption of our integrated systems solutions. We increased revenue by 59% year-over-year. We grew EPS by nearly 90% and we posted record cash flow as we continued to efficiently convert our strong earnings growth into cash returns. ", "These financial results reflect our success in capitalizing on a number of powerful industry dynamics while expanding our addressable opportunities and enhancing our value add in the marketplace. In particular we are benefitting from the proliferation of many forms of wireless data as more and more applications leverage the power of connectivity. Along with this we are seeing a dramatic increase in analog complexity driven by higher performance requirements and these market dynamics have created greater content opportunities, closer engagements with our customers, and higher value solutions across the board with a narrowing field of capable competitors. ", "Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize in this environment by providing integrated RF and analog solutions which enable our customers to navigate increasingly more complex design challenges resulting in above market growth and superior financial returns for our shareholders. This is playing out across our served markets today as evidenced by our first quarter results. ", "Specifically during the quarter we delivered revenue of $806 million that's ahead of our guidance and up more than 59% year-over-year. We produced operating income of $282 million, that's roughly double that over a year ago translating into a 35% operating margin. We posted $1.26 in earnings per share that is up 88% versus a year ago. We generated $383 million in cash flow from operations and we ended the quarter with over a billion dollars of cash on hand with no debt. ", "Looking ahead we see our momentum continuing and while March is normally a seasonal slower quarter in the mobile industry, our broadening market footprint, our new product ramps, and an expanding solutions portfolio enable us to mitigate these seasonal patterns, a clear testament to our diversification. Our Q1 design wins highlights some of these diverse opportunities. In mobile or more notable -- our more notable wins include diversity received modules in Smartphone platforms at several OEM customers including Samsung. Now this is a new product category for us representing a compelling growth avenue for Skyworks. ", "We also launched SkyLiTE. These are highly integrated systems supporting MediaTek's latest SoC reference design across multiple Smartphone platforms. Switching and connectivity modules across Xiaomi\u2019s leading Smartphone platforms as well. And in the broad markets we\u2019ve successfully captured a suite of 10 Skyworks products for Cisco\u2019s latest home gateway solution supporting multiple cable operators. ", "Multiple analog devices in a leading telematics platform for GM vehicles, high reliability analog ICs and avionics systems for Talus, Zigbee connectivity modules for smart light bulbs with Philips LG and others, local area connectivity solutions for Echo and Fire TV streaming media devices at the leading -- and streaming media devices at the leading online retailer. And we captured more than $10 of analog content supporting Technicolor's latest set top box platform for DirecTV. ", "So in total 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for Skyworks. With the design momentum we have in place today, we\u2019re poised to continue our track record of above market revenue growth, expanding profit margins, and earnings leverage. Before providing a more detailed view of our market position I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don for a more in-depth review of the financials. ", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks Dave and thanks for joining us everyone, we appreciate that. Revenue for the first quarter was $805.5 million ahead of our prior guidance of $770 million and up more than 59% versus the year ago quarter. Gross profit was $376.4 million, a 46.7% of revenue ahead of our guidance and up 220 basis points from the first quarter of fiscal 2014. ", "Operating expenses were $94.4 million consisting of R&D expense of $58.7 million and SG&A expense of $35.7 million. We generated $282 million of operating income, roughly twice that the year ago quarter yielding a 35% operating margin. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 13.5% resulting in net income of $244.8 million or $1.26 of diluted earnings per share as compared with diluted EPS of $0.67 in the year ago quarter, that's $0.08 ahead of our guidance surpassing $5 in annualized EPS. ", "Turning to our first quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $383 million in cash flow from operations, invested $87 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $36 million, and we exited the quarter with just over $1 billion in cash on hand and no debt. Moving to our product mix, for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, power amplifiers represented 31% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 48%, and broad markets was 21%. We saw healthy growth across all product categories with the strongest being integrated mobile systems which benefits from strong December quarter seasonal patterns. ", "As a reminder this product category includes SkyOne, SkyLiTE, and our power amplifier duplexers as well as analog products like power management, WiFi, and GPS. It\u2019s also worth noting that our broad markets product lines will serve the connected home, networking, media, automotive, and medical markets grew to 26% year-over-year significantly outpacing the broader semiconductor industry. ", "Now for our second quarter business outlook, we expect second quarter revenue to be $750 million representing 56% year-over-year top line growth and significantly better than normal seasonality. At this revenue level we suggest modeling gross margin in the range of 46% to 46.5% with operating expenses of approximately $95.5 million. Online we anticipate 100,000 in expenses of interest income and other expenses and a cash tax rate around 13.5%. We project our tax rate to remain at these levels for the remainder of our 2015 fiscal year. We expect the share count to be around 194.5 million shares resulting in second quarter EPS of $1.12. ", "Many of the drivers that support a strong 2015 are already in place, giving us a high level of confidence in our road trajectory. We continue to see opportunities for sustainable margin expansion as we leverage our ongoing capital investments and benefits from growing demand for our custom integrated solutions and precision analog products. We recommend modeling 52% incremental gross margin providing a path to continued margin improvement. ", "Longer term we are targeting a growth of 50% gross margin for the company and we have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate our progress towards achieving this goal. All of this gives us a high confidence level on our abilities to extend our track record of investment class financial results putting us on a path towards our goal of $7 in annualized EPS over the long term. With that I will turn the call back over to Dave for his comments on our market trends and growth strategy. ", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you Don. Well it is clear that our business is performing at a high level as we execute on our strategy and maintain a clear focus on operational excellence. For the remainder of the call I would like to provide some additional perspective on the positive trends in our end markets and how we are positioned and how we position the company to capitalize. By all measures wireless connectivity is exploding as an enabling technology. In fact this year's CES was a showcase of groundbreaking new devices leveraging the power of wireless connectivity to enhance our daily lives. ", "Much of the excitement in CES was around innovations in the connected car, the automated home, wearable technologies and previously unimagined new categories like drones all utilizing enabling technologies like 4G, like TPS, local area networking, and near field protocols like ZigBee and Bluetooth. Our overarching mission is to make it effortless for customers to embrace these forms of connectivity leveraging our decades of experience in mobile to enable more and more devices in adjacent markets to become seamlessly connected. ", "Powering these will be a combination of sensors, micro controllers, and most importantly for Skyworks connectivity and power management solutions with a high proportion of analog content and comparatively low digital processing needs. These products require high levels of integration and will need customized solutions produced in massive scale and attractive cost points. All of these attributes play directly into Skyworks core strengths. In this way Skyworks is a conduit into the Internet of Things. This is an exciting opportunity but just one of many tailwinds we are capitalizing on today. More broadly as we enter the calendar 2015 we see four major trends driving our growth. ", "First, leverage of our leadership and high performance integrated systems. In high-end connected devices performance is paramount for our customers to enable seamless any time access to on demand content, social media, streaming services, and cloud data. At the same time technical challenges like band proliferation, like the adoption of advanced uplink architectures, and the implementation of 802.11AC and precision location services are resulting in an explosion in analog complexity. And the net result for Skyworks is an expanding addressable market significantly outpacing unit growth. ", "Second, enabling connectivity in emerging markets. We see tremendous opportunities for 4G devices in markets like China, India, Latin America, Eastern Europe where broadband penetration rates are low and population densities are high. Strategy analytics estimates that Smartphone shipments into India alone will grow at 40% compounded rate through the year 2020. This new generation of devices is replacing a global installed base of billions of 2G voice only phones where we have minimal addressable content. Over the next few years we see significantly increased content opportunities in these markets driven by more stringent performance requirements and much higher complexity. ", "Third, cultivating the Internet of Things. Market analysts estimate that the number of connected devices is poised to explode over the next five years. Analysts project that the machine-to-machine connections alone will increase fourfold through 2020 accounting for nearly 800 million connections, adding to our other opportunities in the connected home in wearable and other markets. These applications all rely heavily on efficient connectivity solutions providing incremental new growth opportunities to Skyworks and enhancing our diversification while dramatically expanding our served addressable markets. ", "And finally aggressively expanding into new vertical markets. We are investing heavily to increase our market footprint in traditional analog segments like automotive, like medical, and industrial. These are highly attractive markets for us characterized by longer product life cycles, fewer competitors, and higher margins. These new growth verticals outside of mobile remain a strategic priority for us and we are investing significant resources in building out our presence in these markets. These elements of our strategy have enabled us to consistently expand our served markets and to significantly outpace the growth of the semiconductor industry while offsetting the seasonal trends to mobile markets. ", "So in closing we are quite optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of 2015 and beyond. We\u2019ve created a unique business model combining strong consistent top line growth with the financial returns by best in class diversified analog company. And we\u2019ve established a solid track record of delivering on that vision to produce superior financial returns. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator lets open the lines please. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. First question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar of Stephens. Please go ahead. ", "Harsh Kumar", "Hey guys, first of all congratulations, stellar quarter, stellar guide, and special congratulations on hitting that 35% mark. That\u2019s like the go standard in the semi business. ", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you.", "Donald W. Palette", "Thanks.", "Harsh Kumar", "I just wanted to say, your numbers in March, your guidance in March is better than seasonal I guess if there was any overarching reason why that is so if you would just give us some color around that?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, thank you very much. Some of these assumptions in our Q2 guidance that allow us to offset seasonality at first, our broad markets products and the aggregate of all of our vertical markets are much less than seasonal. So that\u2019s helping. We\u2019re seeing new opportunities that were ramping and specifically in the connected home, significant wearable products in fact. We also have some customers that are starting to ramp with new mobile platforms for 2015 and they are doing so in the March quarter. So we are seeing content gains, we are seeing more high value added analog systems both in the mobile and in non mobile, and that\u2019s helping Q2. ", "Harsh Kumar", "Great and then as a follow-up, if you look beyond March I think one of your customers had a pretty substantial ramp. As you look beyond March, just I am not asking you to give color but just maybe some I am not asking to give numbers but just some color, what would be the puts and takes on growth let\u2019s say in the June and the September quarter and the rest of the year?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, that\u2019s a good question. Obviously we don\u2019t provide guidance for the year but if you look at our Q1 results and add our Q2 guidance, we are well over 50% top line growth through the first half. If one would take just normal seasonal patterns for the rest of the year and our track record of growing faster in the market we are looking at a very attractive we think another high growth 2015. And plus we got strong visibility today because we are actually ramping programs now. So I think the positive dynamics that are going to continue to fuel this above market performance for us, we are continuing to see big content gains in mobile and connectivity particularly 4G and 11ac by the way. ", "We continue to see a small number of competitors and consolidation of share favoring those companies led by Skyworks that can do a complete overall solution. And our broad markets and vertical segments continue to outperform. I think all of these will play out not only Q1 and Q2 but over the long haul. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ", "Rick Schafer", "Great, thanks and I\u2019ll add my congratulations guys, nice job on the quarter. I had a quick follow up question just kind of talking about the or looking at what you guys sort of expect to see or what\u2019s your expectations are for content increases this year with your two top wireless customers as well as China and emerging markets. I mean is it too early to have a sense of what kind of content increase you could see at particularly your two largest OEMs?", "David J. Aldrich", "Okay, well thanks Rick. So obviously we can\u2019t comment specifically on customers. However, in general these analog architectures are getting much more complex and that\u2019s across our entire customer base in mobile and non mobile by the way. But in terms of our largest customers this provides a tailwind for us. We have consistently more addressable content with each successive design. And in fact we continue to look out two to three years as we become more of a system producer or engaging very early in architectural selection. So we have very good visibility in terms of how the architectures are going. And so I guess I would say our clearly stated goal has been for a long time is to gain content with each model and as an incumbent we have been very successful in maintaining and in fact growing our footprint and that's aided of course by complexity that all of our customers need help in solving particularly on the analog side and that's our strength. Maybe Liam could comment on China. ", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure Rick, this is Liam on China. So if you look at the China dynamic we are very excited about the LTE opportunities. This year we were seeing an LTE number in China that was probably about 92 million or so. We think that number could go up 2X maybe 3X over the next 12 months. Here we have an opportunity to bring in our multimode systems solutions. Invariably there is WiFi, there is GPS, there is power management, very content rich opportunities. And then adjacent to that you mentioned emerging markets, so yet another set of developing markets that are looking for their first wave of connectivity. We support that and often times that could be $2 to $3 of incremental content in markets where there really was no subscriber. So we are excited about both of those opportunities and it is early for that cycle to evolve. ", "Rick Schafer", "Great, and then just kind of switching gears onto auto, I know Dave mentioned auto in his prepared remarks, can you give us an idea I guess maybe what you are targeting and what you have kind of -- how you look at growth in that business whether it is this year or the next couple of years however you are comfortable talking about it in terms of are you going to outgrow the auto unit market by 2X to 3X or just some kind of target on what kind of growth rates we could see there and actually what's primarily driving growth there for you guys?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, sure. As we have outlined with CES and as you have seen with some of the new models that have been released, the connectivity, infotainment all are big part of the auto story. So what we have been doing so far is really leveraging our strength in SOI switching and GPS technology and in WiFi technology, and leveraging some of the great products that we have built through our mobile portfolio. And we are growing that business quite well. We have initiatives to further increase content. We are looking at unique solutions, even some cellular based solutions are entering into automotive. So we look at that as a key part of the IOT portfolio. We have design wins with companies that we named here in the call and we think that is going to continue to proliferate and we are excited about it. We have dedicated teams working that market as well and we will report more to you as the quarters transpire. ", "Operator", "Thank you and the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Vivek Arya ", "Thank you for taking my question. Dave, when you look at the high end of the market and mobile phones I think there is a perception that perhaps overall content might have saturated because these phones already have so many LTE bands and it is just not possible to grow any more bands. What are you seeing on the ground, what do you think can help to drive content up even in the high end phones so even if that's a unit decelerator or flattish you can still see growth even in the high end of the market?", "David J. Aldrich ", "Yes, thank you Vivek. It is a little bit of complicated question. I would say from a band standpoint into the foreseeable future and I am talking a few years out, we don\u2019t see any trend that is narrowing the number of bands. In fact we see the opposite and if you pay attention to some of the auctions that are occurring right now for spectrum, I mean, they are moving higher and higher in frequency on narrow band. So I think that is going to drive a lot of complexity. And the higher in frequency you go by the way, the more differentiated the kinds of technologies we can produce. So, that is a very good trend for us, that implies complex switching, complex amplification, filtering and so on. ", "On the receive side by the way, now it is becoming equally important to have it more and more streaming. So we are starting to see downlink architectures get very, very complicated. That is adding a lot of content in the next five years we think because it isn\u2019t just that you are transmitting all the time, you are actually streaming. So the performance of the battery, the bandwidth and so on is very, very important, how the antenna plays in that environment. And remember Vivek Skyworks is unique because as for example, as connectivity moves to AC and multiple modes of these battery compatibility and WiFi that is the real strength of ours. ", "We are the leader in that space. Power management and the voltage of these devices you see is important so we have suite of power management devices. We are in the camera flash particularly in dual and high performance and so on. So our systems capability is serving us very well but I think it would be a mistake to interpret the current suite of phones as being some kind of the high point in band proliferation. I don\u2019t think there is anything that can stop that for the next several years. ", "Vivek Arya", "Got it, very useful. And then as my follow up more on the operational and the supply chain side, you are growing at this 50% rate probably seven to eight times in the broader semiconductor industry and I am wondering do you see any supply constraints on that growth, how are your frontend and backend facilities holding up and supporting this kind of growth? Thank you.", "David J. Aldrich", "Well if you look at our CAPEX for the last couple of years you could see that we\u2019ve had to grow our capacity. We\u2019ve done that significantly. We\u2019ve maintained our flexible model where we have outsourced partners for all of our critical processes and -- assembly and test and so on. We\u2019ve made provisions for that, we have the capacity, our on-time delivery remains very high. I think we are all set but we have had to make a significant investment over the last several quarters. ", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, Vivek look we spend over 200 million last year and we had 87 million Q1, so it's as Dave said it's spending the CAPEX to maintain that right ratio and those products that we do both internally and externally. And then remember we outsource a significant percentage of our products, the SOI products for power management were fabulous so it\u2019s a nice balance and we feel very comfortable about our ability to get products. ", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes Vivek I\u2019ll make one final comment, the other piece in last couple of quarters you have seen a significant investment in filter capacity. Our high performance temp comp duplexers were on track now to ship a billion in 2015, a billion. And we are in good shape to do that as well. So we know how to do this but it\u2019s a lot of capacity I will admit. ", "Operator", "Thank you and next question from the line of Sid Sinha of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. ", "Siddharth Sinha", "Great, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong results. Dave one of your leading Korean customers is trying to introduce a number of SKUs or handset models it produces by roughly a third and focus perhaps more on super regional phones. I interpret this as more out of dollar content for Skyworks as these ones should not support more regional bands and frequencies, is that a fair assessment?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I\u2019ll let Liam address that. ", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, I understand what you\u2019re alluding to there and so what we are seeing with one of our larger customers is a move towards fewer SKUs but the SKUs that are being provided are much more complex and will handle more of a broader geography. That\u2019s actually a great trend for us. I mean that\u2019s what we do best, we integrate solutions, we are able to provide the breadth of not only the amplification but the filtering, the power management, switching, and WiFi. So we see an opportunity uniquely with this customer now to gain significant content platform over platform and enable what we think to be a step up in functionality and performance on their end. So we are excited about it. You were on to that by your question and we are seeing that coming to fruition this year. ", "Siddharth Sinha", "Great, thanks and just a follow up to that question, the very same OEM is of course facing competitive market dynamics from the Chinese Smartphone OEM base. I guess simple way to ask is if the Chinese Smartphone makers gain share from some of your existing non Chinese android customers would that in totality be a net positive or negative or a neutral for Skyworks?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well actually I think it\u2019s a net positive. We are starting to see a tremendous growth here in China. We talked about that in the prior question. You are seeing names like Xiaomi and Oppo and TCL and Lenovo that are executing very, very well in China which is a huge market. But they are also delivering some compelling solutions into another set of emerging markets outside of China. So we are benefitting from that and we think that the unit volume opportunity there coupled with content gains is a real compelling driver for us and that will be around here for many, many years. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question from the line of Anthony Stoss of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead. ", "Anthony J. Stoss", "Hi guys, my congrats as well to all Skyworks employees.", "David J. Aldrich", "Thank you.", "Anthony J. Stoss", "Two parts if you guys could talk a little bit more on what you are seeing on the infrastructure side, what you saw in December and what you might think infrastructure related business up down or flat in the March quarter? And then we have a bigger picture Dave, now let it seems like the handful of the RF players in this space are all playing within their sub segments. Are you seeing less pricing pressure overall now than you did say a couple of years ago since everybody seems to be doing well and focused on their niches, thanks? ", "David J. Aldrich", "I\u2019ll answer that and then Liam can talk about infrastructure. I will say that we continue to see dramatic changes in the competitive dynamics in the market for a couple of reasons one is that the simple reality is that our customers don\u2019t want, in fact in many cases don\u2019t know what to do with these key component. So even the best in breed companies with whom we used to compete are unable to compete many of them in these advanced system architecture. And so that\u2019s allowing us to capture content simply because we have a solution of direct [ph] product and we have scale in the solution dynamic. We understand it, we approach it as a system not as a bag of chips if you will that\u2019s helping us. ", "So we see consolidation of share with or without consolidation of companies. Where we have seen consolidation that you alluded to, it is actually I think healthy long-term for the market because we are really encouraged to see a reduction in underutilized manufacturing assets where we are seeing some of these RF companies come together. That seems to be the trend which is to shut our underutilized assets in the form of foundries and so on, consolidate design centers. So we are finding it, making it easier for us to hire the absolute best inbred engineers and we are certainly seeing less, more rational environment from a pricing standpoint I would put it that way. ", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure and with respect to infrastructure we are seeing that market slowly improve, commencing with the increases in LTE developments and increasing data rates and demand for screening and services. Some of the beneficiaries that we see, that we also supply to companies like Nokia, Siemens, Huawei, Ericsson, DTV all now are starting to show brighter signs of demand going into 2015 and even into 2016, a long-term forecast. So that market as we have outlined in the past is a margin rich portfolio for Skyworks. It is a big part of our story and broad market and we are looking forward to rolling out some new design wins here this year. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question from the line of Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tim Long your line is open. ", "David J. Aldrich ", "Let's will move on, right. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Cody Acree of Ascendiant Capital. Please go ahead. ", "Cody Acree", "Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations guys. Maybe if we can look at a split of revenue to the best you can, the details that you can give us on handset versus non-handset, obviously the March quarter is much better than seasonal and to the extent maybe you can give us a mix split that is helping to drive that?", "David J. Aldrich ", "Well, I think clearly December marked a high point in terms of the amount of mobile revenue you see because obviously that is where you see the big programs ramping. Our March guidance is to be much less than seasonal so we expect a strong March quarter and that will be driven by a lot of broad market activity. There will be some mobile phones launching but in general the outperformance there is broad market based. You will see a reduction in mobile volume and an increase in broad market vertical markets. Within mobile, where we are seeing by far the greatest strength is in these integrated system solutions, the power amplified duplexers, SkyOne, WiFi based products, power management and the like so I hope that answers your question. ", "Cody Acree", "Well Dave and I guess as you look into Q relative to the first half are you seeing the non-handset markets grow as quickly as you are seeing opportunities of the handsets in units or are you just seeing numerous new applications coming in and driving that. I would also like to get maybe your view on the inventory health as we have kind of wrapped up the year both China and non-China handsets?", "David J. Aldrich ", "Well Cody I think if you looked at our last quarter, our year-over-year growth in broad markets was about 26% and so we have been growing that business 25% to 30% which is far greater than anybody's estimation of what broad market semiconductor content is growing. We are doing it with connectivity, we are doing it in the home, we are doing it in the automobile. And I expect that to continue. Now, over time we see our mix shifting less discreet power amplifier like products, more integrated mobile systems within our mobile products in more and more vertical market, broad market. But we are performing pretty darn well in our mobile business so we don\u2019t see dramatic shifts in that overall split. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Please go ahead. ", "Craig Ellis", "Thank you for taking the questions and congratulation on the very strong execution. Dave I wanted to follow up on the helpful color you have provided around calendar 2015 growth drivers. When talking about Internet of Things and machine-to-machine you mentioned a number of technologies. Clearly Skyworks is very, very strong in connectivity but there are other areas like MCU and sensing where you can go down different paths either developing or acquiring that technology or partnering up, what makes the most sense for Skyworks longer term?", "David J. Aldrich ", "Well, that is great question, a complex one again. If you look at some applications, -- the hottest selling thermostats for example like Next [ph] you will see a module that has a combination of controllers and codes that has been provided by a partner where we have added connectivity, switching, filtering to create a module that is really easy for the system to use. We like that model, it leverages our strength. We are doing more than yes, its connectivity but it\u2019s also the switching, the antenna, tuning the filtering and all of the logic that drives that -- the adoption of these connected devices in markets you describe. The long-term strategy is not to be a microcontroller company. We think that the relative level of processing horse power required is nominal and so we think that we can partner, acquire, and license frankly MCU technology. ", "We are looking in investing in various forms of sensors [ph] so we could -- you could picture that we have connectivity analog system wrapped into an MCM that we produce perhaps in our Mexicali factory with all the requisite componentary. We license in MCU and the piece of the puzzle that we are working very hard on right now is how to do the sensing and control and we are on track to use a couple of different approaches but they\u2019ll likely be with partners. ", "Craig Ellis", "That\u2019s helpful and then I just wanted to clarify a related comment that you had, you indicated that broad market strength is helping to offset seasonality, was that pointedly at the current quarters outlook or is that longer term should we expect to see a year from now relative to historic patterns, a little less seasonality from the December quarter into the March quarter?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I think it\u2019s both. It is clearly the case that the shift from mobile to broad market in Q2 was helping moderate some seasonality. If your company was focused purely on mobile, purely on high-end mobile you\u2019d see far more seasonality that we are able to see. And if you go back and look last year, the year before that, and I would expect you to think this way in years to come we will be far less seasonal as a result of the diversification of our business model both within mobile but outside mobile.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Next question from the line of Edward Snyder of Charter Equity. Please go ahead. ", "Edward Snyder", "Just needed a clarification have you or are you adding premium filter capacity right now and will you offer discreet filters in the open market or are you planning on just consuming all that you built for your own use?", "David J. Aldrich", "We are -- in fact we are significantly more than doubling our filter capacity. I think we\u2019ll probably ship our plan is if not a billion very close to a billion in 2015 and these are all high performance TC duplexers, high frequency narrow band. We\u2019re expanding into new bands that previously weren\u2019t addressable by SAW, by temperature compensating was some really slick processes. We are doing it across multiple customers and multiple applications both on the transmit and the receive side. And no I don\u2019t think for the time being we will offer merchant discreet filters. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Next question from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. ", "Vijay Rakesh", "Hi guys, congratulations on a strong quarter here and a good guide. Looking at your content as you go into 2015 you talked about filters here going to 1 billion, is that also doubling year-on-year into 2015 and how have you been able to improve the opportunity or improve the performance on SAW, TC-SAW versus let\u2019s say -- as you go into the high frequency modes? Thanks.", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, well yes, I mean I think when you do a comparison year-over-year of course we didn\u2019t have that joint venture in house the prior year. But it is true that we are ramping our production substantially. We have customers lined up that consume that capacity as Dave mentioned. We are going to continue to add capital and that\u2019s going to be a great driver for us. And I think we have an opportunity now to leverage a proprietary temp comp process that will move us up from some of the traditional frequency bands that would be to remain to SAW or TC-SAW and move into areas that allow us to address an even greater set of end devices. And when we talk about less devices going discreetly or today really no device discreetly, what we are saying is these billion filters are enabling systems level solutions, PAD like solutions, SkyOne like solutions that have very rich ASPs and a tremendous amount of systems level knowledge and know how that comes in through our team at Skyworks. So it\u2019s not just a filter but it\u2019s our ability to leverage our gallium arsenate technology or switching technology, the Mexicali configurability of custom assembly and test house. Bringing all of that together is really special and we are starting to see the benefits of that today.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Got it and just moving on to the capital allocation side, obviously very strong cash flow and you have a big vault just of cash now. What do you see in terms of dividends or share repurchase or M&A, thanks?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, thanks Vijay. Our allocation strategy I think we have been pretty clear that and we are going to continue to focus on trying to distribute about 40% of the free cash flow to shareholders. We returned over 35% in 2014. We initiated a dividend in 2014, we have actually increased that in two quarters in 2014, and we have repurchased a significant amount of shares. We are going to continue evoke those. And as far as the dividend, the model looks really good, earnings look good, we added a minimum, we are going to look adjustments to that on an annual basis that's at a minimum. So we like that having a strong cash balance gives us a competitive advantage. We like being in that position. ", "Operator", "Okay, and then next question is from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Please go ahead. ", "Steve Smigie", "Great, thanks a lot. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about market share in terms of units of handsets that you are on and some dynamics around that such as LTE increases as a percentage of the mix, does that suggest you might gain shares, you are typically providing some higher performance solutions or is it as you say maybe a proliferation of more customers like more Chinese handset guys, is it difficult to have the resources to keep up with all the new players there, so assuming you could talk about your market share potential from a unit basis, thanks?", "David J. Aldrich ", "I think it is a little hard to answer because if you look at our product portfolio within Smartphones, there aren\u2019t very many Smartphone, there are no Smartphone manufacturers where we don\u2019t have a position. And in fact there aren\u2019t very many Smartphone platforms in the world today where we don\u2019t have something. The real -- so they are so complex. It isn\u2019t like you have 30% PA share or whatever, that's not case. We are participating with virtually everybody and on every base band platform. So some cases like MediaTek where we will go to a broad market, we are on that platform and we gain lot of content and pull through by working together with for example the indigenous subset of China customers. ", "So for us it is more about more content. Now the tailwind is that there is more content period to given complexity. There is more WiFi, more modes of WiFi, there is more bands, there is more filtering, there is more downlink architectures, there is more need for power and voltage management. So that trend is going to happen anyways. And what's helping us in addition to that tailwind is that we see consolidation of share benefitting us because our customers simply aren\u2019t going to the traditional discreet customer base any longer. They are looking for a system solution that maybe a complicated set of integrated circuits integrated in a multitude module with filtering and passive and that is what we think we do better than anybody in the world. So it is those two things, it is share capture by virtue of our system solution, our strong customer relationships. And it is the tailwind of content continuing to increase. ", "Steve Smigie", "Okay, thanks. And just a question on fully integrated solutions, could you talk about what 2015 SkyOne solution might incorporate. I realize you had multiple wins but they are not all the same but is it, you are putting three power amplifiers, two filters switch or something in there, just give a sense of at least when you have had in terms of just to get some sense of the complexity of what you are building for 2015?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure Steve, absolutely. Well in SkyOne it has really become the mainstream part of our portfolio and as you have outlined and what we have learned is that one size does not fit all and our ability to customize and configure account by account has been critical to our success. So we have SkyOne solutions that could be six or seven bands with multiple filters, with power management, some switching of course all integrated with a very, very rich ASP. We could find some customers that want very specific regional SKUs where you might have three or four filters and three or four frequency bands of amplification with maybe some receive side technology and some power. It is really a unique development for each account. What makes it special for us again is our ability to do that systems work, knowledge of multiple base band partners. Now this is a base band agnostic set of solutions. And now with our filtering technology in house we can be much more agile on how we pick and place and manage and select the right frequencies, the right technologies for that customer. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Mike Burton of Brean Capital. Please go ahead. ", "Mike Burton", "Hey guys and congrats on the great results and guidance. Don, first for you, just wondered if you could help us understand how we should be looking at OPEX going forward this fiscal year especially as you have to support the broad markets ramp of many products across a bunch of diverse customer set?", "Donald W. Palette", "Sure Mike. We just spent 94.5 for our Q1 results and guided up million dollars from that. I would expect we have a merit increase midyear in our fiscal year so I would expect to add a 1.5 million to 2 million a quarter to remodel out to the balance of the year. That\u2019s a safe thing to do as we continue to grow when you add the model. When you look at the revenue, the top line revenue opportunities that we have you\u2019ll see there is still tremendous amount of leverage. ", "Mike Burton", "Okay, great and then for Dave and Liam, a very impressive guidance relative to seasonality. I was hoping you can help us understand how the China market has done for you in December and the outlook for that important region in the March quarter as in the Chinese New Year, thanks again?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure with respect to China, actually we are seeing China as a grower here in the March quarter where there are some interesting dynamics now with LTE really picking up. We mentioned some of our lead customers Xiaomi, TCL, Lenovo, etc. So we are seeing that pick up and we are also seeing as Dave outlined in the content opportunity in each one of these phones increase. And of course our ability to grow one of that content has been important as well. So China looks good. Last quarter was about flat so we go into the December quarter it wasn\u2019t a big part of our growth story. We continue to work on design wins and we\u2019re much more of the 4G play and as you know in China the 2G and 3G market is sort of robust with the uptake of LTE which is very good for us. And it is early stages. I mean this is a long term growth cycle while we\u2019re well positioned. We have talked about some of our relationships with players like MediaTek and [indiscernible] and of course Qualcomm. So we\u2019re real fortunate to be in that position and we will look forward to a long term growth cycle there. ", "Operator", "Thank you and the next question is from the line of Suji De Silva of Topeka please go ahead. ", "Suji De Silva", "Hi guys, congratulations on the quarter. In terms of the overall filter capacity for the industry not just for you guys, would you say it\u2019s tight and the people are chasing demand or you\u2019re taking share versus other guys?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think it's tight across the board. In the case of high performance filters which is where we are producing our own that is something where we are servicing our customers with very specific proprietary designs but in general it\u2019s the filter capacity industry wide is quite tight. ", "Suji De Silva", "Okay great and then on SkyOne it occurs to me I mean you guys are providing a lot of value with integration and helping to it will get to market quickly I know if you talked about the relative margins of SkyOne versus your core margins but are they I mean 10 points higher or something like that and you can walk people up the price curve with that and I mean is that is that something that SkyOne growth that could leave a \u2013 tailwind for your margin for several quarters?", "Donald W. Palette", "Yes, we haven\u2019t given a specific number as high as 10 points but they are meaningfully above our standalone power amplifiers and they are accretive to where the business is typically today. So it is a value add proposition for sure. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And next question from the line of Alex Gauna of JMP Securities. Please go ahead. ", "Alex Gauna", "Good afternoon guys. Just wondering has the favorable exchange rates specifically for the yen improved or changed the way people are thinking about the value proposition of TC-SAW versus F-BAR [ph] alternative?", "David J. Aldrich", "No, I would say it has a minimal impact. It\u2019s a minimal impact on our results. ", "Alex Gauna", "Okay, you guys have had a great track record of exceeding your guidance like you absolutely crushed it now a couple quarters in a row. I am wondering is there something that has materially exceeded your calculus that\u2019s led to such upside, where were you off in terms of how you set guidance over the past couple of quarters, is it a single customer, or is it a certain platform ramp, can you give us some color on that?", "David J. Aldrich", "I think we are capturing more of the \u2013 we were probably more successful in the last few quarters relative to our expectations it would have to be in the amount of content we\u2019re sweeping in. So if we capture let\u2019s suppose we engage with a kind of not a full op but a SkyLiTE, kind of a light version of our SkyOne product for regional phone. And then of course we\u2019re competing to try to then capture the receive side, we are trying to capture the antenna switching and tuning, we are trying to capture both WiFi bands or if there are more than one. And so we\u2019re continuing to do a better and better job of making the argument that it's easier for you to engage with Skyworks as a customer for the complete solution. Fewer moving parts, you let us handle more of the complexity, we can help you solve the overall analog system solution that\u2019s such a benefit that when we are surprised we are being surprised with more content within an existing win I would say. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And next question from the line of Ian Ing of MKM Partners. Please go ahead. ", "Ian Ing", "Yes, thanks and sharing my congratulations. In mobile you got top reference design exposure to the merchant base band partners but how are your relationships with the internal base band teams and OEMs that are trying to in source and what do you think their prospects are for a success?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, that\u2019s a good question. We certainly our engage with every potential developer on the chipset side and we have seen in some cases specifically in Korea there\u2019s been some success with a in-house solution and will be lined up with our product as well. We do still see couple of real big players out there who you know. I mean Qualcomm and MediaTek are very powerful. We have a great position with both and there is just a lot happening in the space right now. As Dave mentioned lot of complexity, our customers are having to do much, much more with this technology in addition to things outside of mobile. If your look at the processing speed display so we are finding for the most part our job is to enable connectivity, enable solutions, be customer friendly, be flexible, we are doing that and our products will work with just about very base now. ", "Ian Ing", "Great, and for my follow up the China 4G opportunity potentially doubling or tripling this year, what\u2019s your reliance on the two smaller carriers in China. To the best of my knowledge they currently have trial 4G licenses in FTD but not full commercial at this point?", "David J. Aldrich", "Yes, I mean we are still believing that we\u2019re going to see a number here if you go off of a 90 million or so LTE shipment in 2014. And if your look at the estimates the estimates are as high 250 million or 300 million. We think the number even if it's below that is going to be very explosive for us. We worked directly with the carriers but we also work closely with all the OEMs that we mentioned and the chipset partners that we mentioned. We just had a special note here with MediaTek and our SkyLiTE reference design with close collaboration and that\u2019s tied closely to their OEM suite. ", "Donald W. Palette", "We are not seeing any particular advantage or disadvantage from one carrier to the next if that\u2019s your question. We really don\u2019t see a particular difference one way or another. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And next question from the line of Tom Diffely of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. ", "Thomas Diffely", "Yes, good afternoon. Then maybe one question on the Chinese market then, do you see the relative pricing or margin trends dealing with either the large or the smaller Chinese customers versus your traditional customers. ", "David J. Aldrich", "No, not really and again we\u2019re going in and selling systems based solutions. We think the market there has been great. We don\u2019t have any pricing issues there. ", "Donald W. Palette", "And Tom they are often different but not often. They are usually very different products designed for that price point and designed for perhaps that regional approach or whether it\u2019s a three mode design versus a five mode design. So the products are different, so the margins there are very good but the products are usually quite different. Tailored that product, we know what the market can bear. So we are able to sort of tailor our design around that price point. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Question from the line of JoAnne Feeney of ABR Investment please go ahead.", "JoAnne Feeney", "Yes, congrats everybody, great execution. I wanted to get into a longer term question. I think we all understand the content increase is driven by entire bands and carrier aggregation. We\u2019re clearly in a situation where carrier aggregation is just being implemented first for uploads and then as you pointed out to speed download streaming. One question that I think is important is what happens after a couple of years, do you think the second level of carrier aggregation is complete in a couple of years and do you have your sight on other technology changes and complexities that might come after we get through that download improvement from the secondly league of carrier aggregation, what is that\u2019s going to drive content higher once we are through that stage?", "David J. Aldrich", "Well, I think the content I think downlink you\u2019re right there will be successive future generations of downlink because they are going to be increasingly important. You could see what\u2019s being driven by the carrier or user models and simply what the user appetite is for streaming and streaming of video and streaming of 4K video and so you can just imagine that there will be constant demand from all bandwidth. So we think complexity is downlink. We think complexity is in the transmit side and I will tell you our experience in our design activity today is very much around solving more and more complexity with more high frequency bands, crowded on top of one another. Co-existence issues across the board. I don\u2019t see anything turning the tables on this natural tendency towards complexity for the next five years. I mean there really isn\u2019t any elegant solution that somehow says we got it, you can do this a lot easier. It\u2019s going to be more of this kind of approach to analog design and our ability to integrate more functionality into a system. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And you have a question from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham. Please go ahead. ", "Quinn Bolton", "Hey, guys nice job on the results. Just wanted to ask, you talked about the received diversity opportunity in your prepared comments, wondered if you could shed a little bit more light on that, what number of bands are you seeing being aggregated and those received your first few modules? And then a second question, you talked about emerging markets specifically India as a future opportunity, it sounds like India 4G has been pretty quiet today, when do you think India starts to see a ramp on the 4G handset side, thank you?", "Liam K. Griffin", "Sure, sure on the diversity received solution that really varies customer by customer we have seen some of that. The carrier aggregation bands account could be quite small but it is still incrementally beneficial. But as Dave has mentioned, if we look out at the road map and some of the designs that we are cementing today, we see very rich diversity received technologies on downlink that have up to six or seven filters, multiple L&A, load amplifiers and their functions to receive that signal and amplify it back through the chipset. So we are seeing that happening, SOI switching is embedded there, and it is a content rich opportunity that we are seeing today just in the few leading OEMs but if you look out through 2015 and 2016 roadmaps, more and more customers will adopt this technology. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for closing comments. ", "David J. Aldrich", "Hey, well thank you so much everyone for participating and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences. ", "Operator", "Okay, thank you.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Skyworks' third fiscal quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette ,and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview, followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings.", "I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations Section of our company website for a complete reconciliation of GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, thanks, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to announce another strong performance at Skyworks in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, with revenue, profitability, and earnings all exceeding our guidance. We had a number of key business highlights during the quarter and these include expanding the design win funnel of our integrated platforms like SkyOne, SkyLiTE, high performance PADs, and advanced diversity receive modules, broadening the scale and capabilities of our growing filter portfolio, increasing our momentum in broad markets and enhancing our capital returns to shareholders.", "As the world becomes more interconnected, we are capitalizing on powerful secular growth trends, including the rising adoption of streaming media services, the proliferation of connectivity in the emerging markets and the Internet of Things, driving growth well in excess of the broader semiconductor market.", "The common thread across all of these market trends is the need for seamless access to content and the ability to transmit large amounts of data to the cloud, efficiently, reliability, anytime and anywhere. Technology leaders like Google, like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and others, all recognize this and are prioritizing mobility with their corporate strategies as they strive to provide users with a great connected experience.", "These market dynamics translate into much more complex architectures and higher performance specifications, providing an opportunity for Skyworks to offer differentiated solutions with high barriers to entry. We accomplished this by leveraging our combination of core technology expertise, integration capabilities and systems leadership.", "Our solutions have become mission critical within the overall value chain, facilitating deeper strategic relationships with our customers, a more defensible business model with enhanced financial returns.", "Our third quarter results are clear evidence of this. And specifically, during the quarter, we produced revenue of $810 million. That's up 38% year-over-year. We expanded our gross margins to 49%. That's up 360 basis points year-over-year. We generated operating income of $295 million, with operating margins of 36.5%. We posted $1.34 in earnings per share. That's up more than 60% year-over-year and $0.06 ahead of our guidance. And we're guiding fourth quarter revenue to be $875 million with gross margins of 50% and $1.51 of EPS.", "Finally, we announced during the quarter that we will be doubling our dividend. Adding to our solid financial performance, our Q3 design wins highlight the success we've had in capturing new high value system level opportunities. And our recent broad market wins include ZigBee front-end solutions within Home Depot's smart lighting platform; multiple analog designs supporting telematics capabilities in Subaru's 2016 models, this is complementing prior telematics wins at Ford and at Audi; a customized system in a package including processor and all supporting analog content across Google's refreshed smart home portfolio. We've also won analog ICs within Gemalto's machine to machine modules, supporting industrial and transportation verticals, and over $14 of content in a femtocell design with a leading SoC provider.", "Now in mobile, we delivered a complete system portfolio. This includes a transmit chain, an antenna tuning and switching functions to support Huawei's Honor smartphones. We ramped a carrier aggregation enabled version of our SkyOne Mini, along with diversity modules in ZTE's quad core Star-II mobile platform. And we enabled Meizu's LTE portfolio with SkyLiTE solution supporting Mediatek's latest octa-core chipset. These design wins illustrate the diverse pipeline of rich content opportunities that we are servicing today. And they highlight our competitive edge in applications that require complex systems capabilities.", "So overall I'm quite pleased with our third quarter and more importantly, looking ahead, we continue to find new avenues to further enhance the financial returns of the company.", "And with that, I'll turn that over to Don for more in depth review of our financials.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks Dave, and thanks for joining us everyone. Revenue for the third quarter was $810 million, ahead of our prior guidance of $800 million and up 38% versus the year ago quarter. Gross profit was $396.7 million, and that's 49% of revenue, a point higher than our guidance, and up 360 basis points from the third quarter of fiscal 2014.", "The Q3 margin upside was driven by gains from accretive new product launches, enhancements in our filter business and improved operational efficiencies. Operating expenses were $101.3 million consisting of R&D expense of $65.1 million and SG&A expense of $36.2 million. We generated $295.4 million of operating income and that's up 65% year-over-year and yielded a 36.5% operating margin. Below the line we had a gain of roughly $900,000 from interest and other income. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 11.4%, resulting in net income of $262.5 million or $1.34 of diluted earnings per share, and that's $0.06 better than our guidance.", "Turning to our third quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $222 million in cash flow from operations, invested $108 million in capital expenditures and our depreciation for the quarter was $42 million. We also distributed $72 million to shareholders through our dividend and stock repurchase activity. And we exited the quarter with over $1.1 billion in cash on hand and no debt.", "Finally, we recently announced that we are doubling our quarterly dividend from $0.13 per share to $0.26 per share, payable on August 27, 2015. The increased dividend represents approximately a 1% yield based on our current stock price and $1.04 per share in annual payout. This increase is supported by our expanding cash flow base. Our quarterly dividend, along with our ongoing share repurchase initiatives reflect the high confidence we have in our business fundamentals and remain an important components of our ongoing commitment to return approximately 40% of free cash flow to shareholders.", "Moving to product mix. For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, power amplifiers represented 24% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 53% and broad markets was 23%. Once again, integrated mobile systems was our fastest growing category, up 120% year-over-year, highlighting the shift to our higher margin system solutions, which is ongoing across our customer base. Our broad market products again grew over 20% during the quarter, well ahead of the diversified analog market, fueled by the spread of connectivity through a broad range of end markets.", "Now turning to our fourth quarter business outlook. We expect revenue to be $875 million, and that's up 22% year-over-year. At this level, we anticipate gross margin to be 50%. That represents more than a 400 basis point improvement year-over-year. This increase is driven by the continued adoption of our integrated solutions and precision analog products, integration efficiencies and ongoing operational initiatives. We continue to recommend modeling 55% incremental gross margin from the new Q4 baseline providing additional runway for margin improvement ahead.", "We expect operating expenses to be $104 million to $105 million, driven primarily by incremental investments in engineering and development teams. These investments expand our footprint within new verticals and our serviceable market opportunity, as well as further enhancing our integration capabilities. We expect fourth quarter operating margins to exceed 38%.", "Below the line, we anticipate around $900,000 in income from interest and other income and a cash tax rate around 11.5%. For fiscal 2016 we continue to recommend modeling a cash tax rate in the 14% to 15% range. We expect our Q4 share count to be around 196 million shares resulting in EPS of $1.51.", "We maintain a high level of confidence in our growth trajectory through 2016 and beyond. Having just guided over $6 in earnings per share on an annualized basis, we continue to accelerate our progress towards our $7 EPS target.", "And with that I'll turn the call back over to Dave.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Don. And for the remainder of my commentary, I'd like to provide more insight into the dynamics in our end markets, which are enabling us to drive higher market share and higher profitability.", "As wireless technology in general continue to advance, our customers are embedding significantly more capability into progressively smaller footprints, while pushing for higher performance and improved battery life all with perfect quality. We see this trend repeating itself across our served markets and throughout our customer base, in mobile devices, in the connected home, as well as the automobile, and even on the factory floor.", "The challenges our customers face today are numerous and they include managing coexistence of multiple communications protocols, like 4G, like WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth and Zigbee, accommodating more and more operating frequency bands with tighter and tighter band spacing; implementing advanced data techniques like diversity, carrier aggregation, multi-stream WiFi to improve throughput, and employing envelope tracking to improve power efficiency.", "In short, design challenges are skyrocketing and customers who often have limited expertise of analog systems design are struggling to keep up. This creates a pressing need to align with the right supply partners, to provide solutions that speed time to market, that increase reliability, and that reduce supply chain risk.", "Because of this today, we are on the drawing board with customers much earlier in the design cycle. In many cases two years or three years ahead of current-generation products. This provides significantly better visibility, and influence into technology roadmaps and architectural decisions.", "So to reiterate, as the leader in complex integration, Skyworks is increasingly a partner of choice for customers I think for three primary reasons. First, we have unmatched system design capabilities dating back to the inception of our company, including a substantial force of system expertise of experts with backgrounds in mobile device design and backgrounds in diversified analog.", "Second, we have extensive product breadth in core enabling technologies like GaAs, SOI, silicon-germanium, CMOS and filtering enable us to leverage the best technology for any particular application.", "Third, we have unrivaled advanced multi-technology, multichip production capabilities with proprietary processes, allowing us to provide customers with highly customized system solutions. And a key advantage for us today is our high-performance filters. Our unique technology edge in premium filters enables higher system performance through tighter band spacing with improved isolation and a more efficient signal path.", "As the market continues to evolve, we see tremendous demand as systems solutions sweep in an unprecedented amount of filter content. And in response to this strong demand outlook, we are investing in new capabilities and ramping capacity both internally and with our outside fab partners.", "And finally during the quarter, we acquired Quantance, an innovator in envelope tracking technologies. This technology acquisition provide us with a rich portfolio of fundamental ET patents and design expertise aim at enhancing power efficiency and minimizing heat energy dissipation in connected devices. We see numerous opportunities to leverage this technology across our product lines.", "So to summarize, the end result is that we're able to develop the smallest, the most efficient, the most integrated products in the market today, incorporating all amplification, switching, logic, and filtering, and this is both in transmit and receive functions. The value these systems provide to customers translates directly into best-in-class returns. And I think this dynamic is validated by our 50% gross margin outlook for September quarter, and our 55% incremental margin guidance.", "In closing, we've created a unique business model, tethered to the global wave of connectivity and combining consistent above market topline growth with the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analog company.", "Operator, that concludes our prepared comments. We can open it for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question will come from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Go ahead please.", "Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah, hey guys. First of all, congratulations again. Once again, stellar, phenomenal execution.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Harsh.", "Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.", "Quick question Don, the base line, I think in the press release you mentioned now is 50%, 38% on the op side, 50% on the gross side. Just wanted to clarify, as we look in the future, is that predicated on a certain revenue level? Does that even apply in seasonally off quarters? If you can just give us a color so we can model out in the future a little bit better.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I mean, it's consistent with how we've talked about modeling from before. It's just a new baseline and it's a new incremental percentage. So when you're modeling as you go forward, quarter-to-quarter, you start with the guide that we gave. That's the new baseline. And then any incremental revenue that you add to that, you drop through at 55%. The OpEx, we're recommending adding about $3 million a quarter. And you'll see that there's a tremendous amount of leverage left in the model and we continue to focus on growing the gross margin and you'll see that it grows as we move forward. And quite frankly you model out that way, and we talked about mid-teens growth potential in these out years that you'll see we get to that annualized $7 number, but it's sometime in calendar 2016.", "Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.", "Fantastic. And as a follow-up, maybe a question for Dave. I know that one of your large customers is in a build mode. Could you may be give us some color on how the build plays out versus between the September and the December quarter for you guys?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, September quarter is normally a seasonally strong quarter for us. It is the early part of seasonal ramps \u2013 sorry, customers. We're also seeing strong growth in the connected home and some of our IoT verticals. So I think as Don commented, we're guiding revenue to be up about 22% with very strong earnings leverage. And I think we'll play that into December as well which is normally up seasonally. And given our current visibility and our expectations across our markets, we think we can exceed that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Go ahead please.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you for taking my question and congrats also on delivering I think what is some of the best growth and execution and consistency in this industry.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Vivek.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Dave, so maybe as a first question, I think you answered the near term Q3 and Q4 trends. Just longer term, what innings of the growth cycle do you think we're in? Because I understand the content growth, but high-end smartphone unit demand seems to be peaking, it seems to be sort of a zero-sum gain between the top two players. Do you think there are enough content growth opportunities for you in the mid-range and low-end to drive overall growth for the company?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Vivek, well that's a big question. I will say this, I do believe we're in the early innings in an upgrade cycle with 4G being kind of the operative technology. And you could go country-by-country, you can look at China, you can look at India, you can look at Central/Latin America, and you get the number of customers who continue to be either unconnected or connected through a 2G or 3G device. So we think there's an upgrade.", "But this complexity that we've spoken so much about in the past and that we highlighted on the call today is not abating. It's not lessening. So they were going to be fewer competitors capable of delivering the product breadth with the scale of Skyworks. And more customers who are looking for that content expansion is simply to get them to time to market with a reliable product.", "So I think the long-term growth for us in mobile is very strong. We think that the growth rate in the TAM is about 15%. We like to always try to do better than the growth rate for TAM. And of course, we're in the infancies of many of these vertical markets, many of which are becoming connected for the first time. And we've got a strong systems engineering team, we've got feet on the street, we think we can continue to penetrate new market opportunities with new growth vectors.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Very helpful, Dave. And then as a follow-up, you highlighted the growth in the broad markets where you have grown over 20%, much better than the diversified analog peers. Do you think adding other building blocks through M&A could help accelerate that growth? And where I'm going with that is you have a very clean balance sheet, no debt, you're generating good cash. Is there a way to leverage that and accelerate growth in some of these new broad markets?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think the short answer is yes. Quantance is a small acquisition, but gives us the capability into envelope tracking. We invested in the JV, which we will complete 100% ownership here in the not too distant future. That gave us a real strong base of high-performance filter technology. We've done acquisitions in the past which added power management and very specific strength in connectivity. So we'll continue to look at these kinds of acquisitions that allow us to do two things. One is to increase the stickiness of our designs within mobile, and add a broader target, a larger target of TAM. And secondly, that we can leverage into this growing list of vertical markets and Internet of Things that give us, again, more relevance and give us more of an overall system approach.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, and I'll add my congratulations, Dave and Don and Steve. Yeah, I guess my first question is just what impact you guys think Apple's recent success in China has had on the local OEMs' design and build plans? Maybe part of that answer, what do you think average overall RF content sort of looks like amongst the local Chinese OEMs today in 4G versus what you think it could look like in a year or two?", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Sure, Rick, this is Liam. Well, we participate broadly through China, certainly with the local brands, names like Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo, et cetera, and also through the large global Tier 1s that have also benefited from the strength. So there's been some bumpiness in China, but the 4G opportunity for Skyworks is very strong. It remains a growth catalyst for us. We see content expansion up two times to three times what you would see in a 2G or 3G phone. So we're excited about it. We're also pleased to see that the content for us has moved well beyond amplification and receive technology. We're bringing in WiFi, we're bringing in GPS, even power management. So, we have a long way to go in that cycle, and we feel very good about it.", "Richard E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. And then maybe a follow-up on an earlier question on your largest customer. I mean, if you agree that band counts \u2013 and I don't know if you do, but if you agree that band counts aren't rising a whole lot in the coming iPhone refresh, maybe can you help us understand where the content gains or opportunities are for RF or in the RF world? Maybe what total RF content sort of looks like, the current generation versus what's coming here in a couple of months?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, well, I'll take that. This is Dave. Without being specific with any one particular customer or launch, in general, we are seeing \u2013 it's not true that band count isn't increasing. In fact it's increasing a lot. And in fact if you look at the roadmaps of many of our customers, both low and very high-frequency bands that are quite tight in terms of spacing need to be added, will continue to be added, and the problem is there's no universal standard. So in some cases it'll be region and even country specific, which adds a great deal of complexity of more filtering, more switch arms, more amplification.", "And when we think about where the content is coming from, it's really across the board. Most people understand that there are more filters on the transmit path, more amplifiers, more need to switch, that's clear, that continues to go up. What's interesting going forward is the receive, as more and more streaming is required, the receive content is going way up. And in fact in many cases, we're seeing our customers and our chipset partners beginning to disintegrate, if you will, pull functions out like low noise amplifiers and so on in the receive side and try to figure out a way to get across multiple bands better receive performance. WiFi is moving to AC and Mymo technology. That's a big plus for us. We're doing much more in power management and voltage control, we're able to control the voltage that a power amplifier sees on the input side and it gives us much better current consumption, much higher efficiency, more switching. I think you understand that, so we're doing lighting and power, so I would say all of those categories continue to add content.", "Operator", "Thank you, we'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "Thank you for taking the question and I'll echo the congratulations on the execution around profitable growth.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "I wanted to start with a question for Don on gross margins, and there's two parts to it, Don. One is a near-term question, one is a long-term question. The near-term question is with incremental gross margins being nicely above the 55% level, what causes them to move back towards 55% near-term? And the longer-term part of the question is, if we look out over a multiyear basis with your 55% incrementals, is there anything out there on the horizon that would create a ceiling with gross margins at some lower level than 50%, 55%, whether it's 52%, 53%, 54%, what have you?", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, answer to the first question, Craig, is that the incrementals, if you look at what we delivered in the Q3 actual and what we've guided, they are actually above the 50% or 55% range, which we have traditionally seen, and that's really sort of a reset step function of what you're seeing in the products that we're now designing and releasing, the fact that we have captive filters, we've driving cost down. All that just resets where we are from a margin profile. So that's the way to think of it.", "Now there's \u2013 we've changed the portfolio as we're shipping new products. There's more value added, more integration and it has reset the margin baseline, so that now going forward we'll be at that 55%. As far as ceilings years out, it's hard to think in those terms. We'll continue to be very focused on driving margin improvement and expansion, and we see over the next several years a clear path to continue to do that. So that isn't anything that when we're looking at the products that we're going to be trying to win and design for that we think there's continued accretion on the margin line. So it's something we think we can deliver.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "And then the follow up question is for Dave. Dave, as you look at the product portfolio now, it's got some of the broadest diversity I can recall seeing, and there are things like diversity receive that are coming in and adding to growth, but can you just speak qualitatively to your confidence in the growth potential of the portfolio and in your ability to continue to add incremental products that can have a material impact on the company's growth?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think the confidence is high because as we've commented in the prepared remarks, we are participating earlier in the design cycle. So we know what's being lined out one or two years out and that's very helpful to us in terms of being able to align our technology footprint and our engineering resources. I'm very confident that the combination of manufacturing technologies with multi-chip modules, bumping flip chip and size reduction, shielding and so on, along with a broad portfolio of semiconductor technologies, will allow us to be able to be flexible and agile in terms of what the market demands. We're not wedded to any one in particular technology and we're vertically integrated in the manufacturing of those technologies at the assembly level. So I'm very confident. We've been very successful in hiring. Skyworks is an attractive company to work for today, I'm proud to say, and so we've had great results in hiring terrific people and opening design centers, and the turnover remains very low in terms of our overall head count. So I think we're in good shape.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Cody Acree from Ascendiant Capital. Please go ahead.", "Cody G. Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC", "Yes, thanks, guys, and let me echo my congratulations.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Cody.", "Cody G. Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC", "Maybe can you just compare the expectations for growth over the next couple quarters between handsets versus non-handset applications?", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Cody. Well I think we have \u2013 as David indicated, next couple quarters we go through some seasonal ramps in the back half of the year in mobile. There's some content gains and opportunities for us there that we've lined out on with large accounts. But in the broad markets we're seeing a great proliferation of design wins across IOT, connected home, access points and routers, media boxes, and number of applications as I mentioned in appliances and remote and video monitoring, things like that. So those are all building up and our broad market business will still grow probably 20% year-over-year. So we're comfortable with the blend of the mix. We have outstanding visibility into both sides of the business right now, so we feel good about that and we'll continue to report, hopefully, incremental gains in broad...", "Cody G. Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC", "And Dave, historically your customers have really played the different suppliers, specifically back when they were just point solution PA vendors, but as you talked about fewer players being able to give full systems level solutions, are your customers starting to get to a point where they become sensitive to any one of you or your competitors gaining too much market share?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the way we think about it and the way we try to position this with our customers is that at the end of the day if we can provide them with a very solid supply chain backed up by a track record of execution, and we can help them solve these really problematic changes in design and complexity, they've welcomed giving us more content as long as we continue to execute. It is the case \u2013 I think, in the world of RF many years ago that was a unique function where there were lots of competitors and you could go pin to pin from one to another and swap out. It hasn't really been the case in display. It's not the case in audio codec. It's not in the case of baseband, and it's no longer the case in RF. So we think it's coming down to high market share capability with those with the breadth and scale of which Skyworks is one and we think the best position.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Please go ahead.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.", "Thanks a lot. Yesterday Qualcomm talked a lot about share loss in the premium modem, some at the expense of internal solutions like Shannon and Samsung and then HiSilicon and Huawei and I guess some to MediaTek. How should we look at that with regard to Skyworks' content on the different designs? Is that shift positive, negative or neutral to you?", "And then I had another question on flagship phones released in the second half of the year. There's been different lead times, not only for the phones themselves, but also for the different types of components you ship into the phones, and Skyworks has experienced just about every variant of this over the years. We've had strong ramps in June and then more modest growth in September, December, et cetera. How is that going to shake out this year? Are you \u2013 more WI-FI contents? Are you going to be strong early and then more modest later? Or how can we look at that because it's a big determinant in terms of what people think about the second half growth. Thanks, guys.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Sure Ed. With respect to Qualcomm and baseband proliferation or participation I should say, we're agnostic, so we have a number of platforms with Qualcomm baseband. We've got some real exciting platforms now with MediaTek, we mentioned Octa-Core, Samsung LSI, even Spreadtrum domestically in China. So we feel very comfortable about the way we're diversified across the baseband partitioning. And the content opportunities that we've discussed, they play across all of those as well, so that part of your question I think we're in good shape. We feel comfortable with our mix and our teams are working with every one of those chipset providers.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Ed, it's increasingly less about a reference design participation, although that's still important. It's more about how the customer feels about the portfolio and how comfortable they are with your technology roadmap, and they tend to drive the content expansion for us. And so I think as you see different choices on whose applications processor, whose modem, I think that's less an issue than what the customer is trying to accomplish and the relationship we have with that customer.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And your question about the percentage mix, if it's any different. Ed, I would say that if you looked at the profile of the ramp and the shipments, it's going to be consistent with what we've seen in the last several years where there's little or no revenue in the June quarter, and it starts in September quarter and ramps in the December quarter. So that's the pattern we would expect to see, very similar to the last couple years.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.", "Hey, Dave, your comments, is that to suggest that a lot of especially the low-end phones and I know you're doing a lot more SkyLiTE, SkyeModule. There are people who are kind of leaving the reservation of the reference design because LTE is so much more complicated. Are you getting more guys turning to you and saying, hey, solve all these problems for us. I won't say forget the reference design, but if we have to do something special, because Samsung's always done that. They've designed their own front ends. And Apple does. Is that now spreading to some of the big Chinese or the white label Chinese guys where they're just turning to the RF guys and saying, irrespective of what's on the design, give us a solution that works?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That's a good question. Clearly among the companies you mentioned, Samsung and others, it's becoming increasingly, we know what we want to do, and it may be on the reference design; it may be not. Usually it's not in fact. So they're looking to us very early in the selection process, the architectural design process to help them figure out a way to architect it within, for example, their current consumption budget, their size constraints and so on.", "China is an interesting play because what we're doing today with some customers, we're customizing. We're completely customizing around Huawei, for example, and others. In others, the customization occurs with our tight relationship with, for example, MediaTek where we're actually doing custom designs for them with that chipset that don't play with any other chipset. So that's the way it is in China today. It's a bit of a mix.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you. First, if you could just touch on China again. What are you guys seeing there from an overall demand perspective? There's a lot of moving parts over there, there are lot of different data points talking about some slowdown. So, if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing there from a demand standpoint and maybe just an update on how you see the 3-mode to 5-mode going, understanding both are content increases, but obviously 5-mode a little bit better.", "And then the second one if you could just talk a little bit about some of the new products like carrier agg and envelope tracking, how long do you think before those become a more meaningful parts of the revenue base? Thank you.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Tim. Let's start with China. Certainly there's been well-reported choppiness I would say in that market, but most of it has really been 2G and 3G ramp downs as 4G accelerates. And if you look at 4G, that's the opportunity that we're excited about. We have a tremendous content gain there. We talked about that already today. But in addition to the content gain, which could be $2, $3, $4 per phone, we're also seeing units start to look a little bit better through China just in the last month of June. In the full quarter of June, we saw 60 million net adds on the 4G cycle, so we feel good about that continuing through 2015, hopefully hitting about a 250 million unit number. Now, some of that business is won through local brands that we mentioned and some of it we benefit with global tier 1s that sell into China. So that's working out pretty well for us. A little bit of a slow start but we see it picking up in the second half.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Go ahead please.", "Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "Hey, everyone. Great quarter. Congratulations.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Alex.", "Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "I know you guys are very conservative in terms of how you set expectations or at least you're very responsible in how you do it. But you manage to blow away numbers in an environment where a lot of people are stepping on landmines here and there. Can you be maybe a little bit more specific on what upsided in the quarter to allow you to deliver such impressive results, especially relative to the backdrop of the overall industry?", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Alex, thank you for that. I think it's a combination of things. We are starting to see the planets align increasingly with the increased content. We've always had strong participation on the transmit side and in the last few years on the WI-FI connectivity. Some of these products are relatively new to us, power managements, some of the display products, voltage regulators, the receive side for sure, some of these filtering based, filter-enabled systems. And what we're finding is that we're just getting a higher hit rate with higher dollar content and higher margin. It's as simple as that. We track off the designs, we sample how many of them go through preproduction, get verified, get validated and then volume production, and to the extent as in most cases, we're sweeping in multiple devices in the same phone, where we win two devices, three devices, the whole suite, and we're increasingly finding our customers willing to let us help them architect right at the PCB level with more and more of our content. It benefits them because they get one-stop shopping and they get confidence in the interplay between those components.", "And secondly, I'm really thrilled with the development team's performance in these vertical markets and our ability to put, in many cases, new associates on the street to support our customers' architectures as we learn what it takes to win in the home, in the automobile, on the factory floor, in the hospital. That business just is doing great and it turns out that the technology footprint we've deployed in mobile is exactly what these markets require, and our team is just doing a terrific job I think. Not perfect, but a terrific job of lining those customers up, understanding their system level needs, and then executing.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Great. Thanks a lot, guys, and I'll add my congratulations to good results in a really tough environment.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Just looking at the broad market's business, you guys are really diversifying in a whole bunch of stuff here. Can you provide some more detail maybe on let's say the first half of 2015? How much revenue might have come from automotive versus say IOT versus say like enterprise and home routing?", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. The majority of the business comes through IOT in general and we actually include some of the automotive portfolios within that. So we have an opportunity in the connected home that we mentioned, some access points, home routers, media, set top box, it's all been strong for us. Automotive coming off a very low base for Skyworks is picking up. We talked about the telematics opportunities, the in-dash opportunities, and that's a portfolio or product line I think has great potential over the next several years. We're finally getting deep engagements with some of the automotive manufacturers we hadn't been working with at all, and we see there opportunity looking out. And then you have this proliferation of wearables, connecting appliances, connecting, as I mentioned, in home security, et cetera, using ZigBee, using Wi-Fi, using Bluetooth, using cellular, all of that is coming together and it's a buildup of design wins and revenue that will be certainly a multi-year opportunity for Skyworks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks.", "Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I wanted to ask on the filter business in particular, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that some of the gross margin upside is being driven by enhancements to the cost profile and the yield profile of that business. So maybe just a little bit more on what you're doing and whether that can continue to be a tailwind as we go through the next several quarters. And the second part of this is just on the performance side. Any details on what you're doing with premium filters TC-SAW in particular to improve the performance of those filters? Thank you.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Well, as you've noted, the filter business for Skyworks has been incredible. It's early innings for us, but we will ship by the end of this calendar year over a billion filters, all of which will be integrated into our systems solutions. So, the appetite for the technology has been unprecedented. We continue to improve the technology. We continue to move up in frequency and tighter in our performance specifications. We expect this to be a long term cycle for us. We expect to be adding opportunities, adding customers and continuing to leverage our manufacturing prowess and our technology strength in that area.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "And as far as contribution to the profitability, clearly when the acquisition was initiated, you're not stacking margin any longer. We're manufacturing. But we've done a really good job with some CapEx investments, productivity yield improvements, where we've done a really nice job of driving the cost down. We think we can continue to do that and that's all really helped our overall margin profile, so.", "And if you look at the CapEx we've been spending, because we're making investments based on volume visibility, a good percentage of that has been investments in our filter business, so they're paying off. And you're seeing that's part of the reasons the margins are improving. That's certainly part of it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we have Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Go ahead, please.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Yeah, hi. Thanks guys. Congratulations on a solid quarter and guide here.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Thanks, Vijay.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Thanks. Just briefly here. As we try to gage what the RF content growth is, how would you look at carrier aggregation and there's one and two band, and three band carrier aggregation. What's the penetration today and how do you see that progress over the next couple of -- next year let's say?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, now that's a great question. So, we have a lot of great design techniques and approaches to deliver carrier aggregation, whether it's inter-band or non-continuous (sic) [non-contiguous] bands. There's a lot of complexity, there's a lot of switching opportunities, leveraging SOI, there's a lot of L and A opportunities for us, and it speaks also to these diversity receive modules that we've mentioned in the past. The good news for us is the complexity is extremely high, the number of players that can compete and actually develop and deliver the types of solutions that are required very, very few and we're one of the leaders. And the adoption rate right now is low. So, we see this as a long term cycle for us. It does tremendous work in terms of bringing downlink rates, data rates up significantly and it brings tremendous design opportunity for Skyworks. So, it's a type of product that you're going to see in the market here in 2016 and it will continue to expand and you'll see more and more content with us on board.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we have Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.", "Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC", "Yes, congratulations on the very consistent execution every quarter, every environment.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Thank you.", "Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC", "Yeah, really, more on this trend towards RF customization in China. I think in the past the top two OEMs would get a lot of customization and the rest got something closer to reference designs, so any implications there in terms of servicing those customers and operating expenses and why do you think they prefer custom when off the shelf has worked for the third largest OEM and higher in the past?", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Yeah, sure, I understand. Really what's happening is the complexity is going up. We've been talking about that theme for a while, and you have a lot of very compelling brands in China that really don't have the RF infrastructure. They don't have the technology infrastructure, the engineering head count to deliver and develop the very complex 4G solutions. So as we've mentioned before, our engagement has begun in many of these accounts in 2G and 3G. And as they have evolved, and our partnerships with chipset providers has become more sticky, we've been invited in earlier in the cycle to develop customized solutions that meet the specific needs of a Huawei, of a Xiaomi, OPPO, or vivo. So it's a great opportunity for us, but we also help these OEMs get to market quickly.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would also add that we have a strategy, call it rapid customization if you want. We have SkyLiTE, SkyMini (45:04). We have platforms that allow us to very quickly facilitate the customer's ability to drop bands if they want to, to go more regional, to take filter content out, switching content out, and do it within a fixed, if you will, a fixed footprint, even a fixed pin-out, fixed volume. So is it custom? Yes it is in that we can reconfigure it in our factory. No one else can do it. No one else can replicate it. But it's giving some degree of customization and cost optimization for even those second and third tier indigenous OEMs within China that previously they had to just take one size fits all.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Go ahead please.", "Krysten Sciacca - Needham & Co. LLC", "Hi. This is Krysten Sciacca in for Quinn Bolton. Congrats on the quarter you guys.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Krysten Sciacca - Needham & Co. LLC", "Can you talk about any possible capacity additions in the filtering business, and when you expect these adds to come online?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We don't have capacity constraints today, although as Don mentioned, a great deal of our capital investment this quarter and in prior quarters has gone into that footprint. The yields are coming up. One thing we didn't talk about earlier is that we are finding increasing bands that we can address with our newest technology that's quite proprietary and unique that's allowing us to go up to 2 gigahertz. We're confidently producing bands 2, bands 3. We're adding more frequency bands with a roadmap to go above 2 gigahertz, so we're seeing a combination of pure volume and more and more bands that are appropriately using at least our version of high performance Temp-Comp SAW in lieu of a bulk device, a bulk acoustic device.", "Operator", "Okay. Thank you. We'll go next to Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Go ahead please.", "Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Yes. Good afternoon. So on that same line, when you look at your portfolio of high performance filters today, what percent of the bands in a high-end 4G phone do you think you cover at this point?", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Yeah, I mean, it all depends on the specific architecture. There's some regional SKUs and different approaches. But the majority of the bands that we address make up the majority of the phone in many cases. So we probably have 60% to 70% of the coverage with our technology.", "Operator", "Okay. Thank you. Then next we have Suji De Silva with Topeka. Go ahead please.", "Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets", "Hi Dave, hi Don, Liam. Congrats on the quarter again.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Thank you.", "Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets", "Just staying on the filter theme here. As you improve the TC-SAW products and get the technology higher, can you remind us what the inherent advantages of TC-SAW are versus BAW. I'd imagine cost is one, but If you could walk us through that.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's always cost in the sense that it's just fewer process steps and so on, and the throughput is higher on any given level of capital investment. The advantage is that you can put very tight spacing, particularly at the sweet spot of the frequency band that goes up to about 2 gigahertz. Size is an advantage when you get in the lower frequencies, less of an advantage when you get in the high frequencies.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing comments.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you very much for joining us everyone. And we look forward to seeing you in the near future.", "Operator", "Thank you.

This call is being recorded.", "At this time, I will turn the call over to Steve Ferranti, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.", "Stephen Ferranti - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Cathy. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Skyworks fourth fiscal quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today are Dave Aldrich, Don Palette and Liam Griffin. Dave will begin today's call with a business overview followed by Don's financial review and outlook. We will then open the lines for your questions.", "Please note that our comments today will include statements relating to future results that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those noted in our earnings release and those detailed from time to time in our SEC filings. I'd also like to remind everyone that the results and guidance we will discuss today are from a non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we've used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn over the call to Dave for his comments on the quarter.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Steve. And welcome, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a strong close to fiscal 2015 producing fourth quarter financial results that once again significantly outpaced the growth of the broader semiconductor market. During the quarter, we posted revenue of $881 million. That's representing 23% growth from the prior year. We delivered operating income of $335 million. That's up 42% versus last year. We earned $1.52 in diluted earnings per share, which is up 36% year-over-year. We generated over $230 million in cash from operations, and we are guiding for December quarter revenue to be up again sequentially with gross margins of 51% and EPS of $1.60.", "Given that Q1 guidance exceeds our previous 50% gross margin target, we're introducing an updated mid-term model, which Don will provide the details of later in the call.", "Our fourth quarter performance closed another record year for our company. And for the full year, we posted revenue of $3.26 billion. This represents a 42% annual growth. We expanded our operating margins by 600 basis points, exiting Q4 at over 38%. And we grew earnings per share by 63%, continuing to demonstrate strong financial leverage. And we also generated roughly $1 billion in cash flow from operations, and we returned over $360 million to shareholders through a combination of dividend payments and share repurchases, while increasing investments in R&D, expanding production capability, and extending our technology roadmap.", "All in all, this was an outstanding year for Skyworks. And we continue to see numerous opportunities to capitalize on the powerful technology trends that are fueling the long-term growth in our served markets. These include exploding data consumption across the consumer and enterprise landscape; these include soaring adoption of cloud services from the likes of Amazon, Google and others; the proliferation of connectivity throughout the emerging markets; and the rise of the Internet of Things. These global trends are all in the early innings and all rely on seamless connectivity to efficiently and reliably move massive amounts of data anytime and anywhere.", "The end result is a boom in connected devices and worldwide data consumption fueling tremendous opportunity, but also creating major technical hurdles within the industry. By virtually every measure, consumer appetite for streaming services is growing dramatically, as traditional broadcasters and new content service providers, like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, race to gain a foothold in the new online world of content distribution.", "In fact, analysts estimate that mobile data usage will increase at nearly 60% compounded through 2019. This places significant strains on network infrastructure and on devices. As an example, consider that an hour of streaming high-definition video consumes roughly one to two gigabytes of network bandwidth, 4K streaming devices consume two times to three times this amount. And further exacerbating the industry's challenges is the limited amount of spectrum and network capability available to address this pending surge in data.", "Market forecasts estimate that only around one-third of the spectrum needed to meet bandwidth requirements over the next few years is in service today. And to solve this imbalance, carriers are either deploying new spectrum or finding ways to increase the throughput of existing frequency bands. Finally, this rising data trend directly impacts the battery life of today's devices, as technologies like LTE Advanced, eventually 5G demand, and they demand higher and higher power levels. This comes at a time when our customers are already wrestling with power budgets to implement more capable processors, higher definition screens and other power consuming features.", "As customers struggle to adapt to these market realities, we are increasingly being brought into the architectural discussions much earlier in the design cycle. This is the primary reason we are shaping next-generation solutions to implement higher band counts and the use of unlicensed bands, increasing carrier aggregation combinations, tighter and tighter filtering requirements, more complex receive architectures, advanced Wi-Fi configurations and more sophisticated techniques to manage power and increase efficiency.", "As customers implement this next level of functionality, they are increasingly demanding more system-level solutions and higher levels of integration and these are playing directly into Skyworks' strengths. We see all of these dynamics increasing our addressable content across the breadth of our service markets for years to come. As I mentioned earlier, this backdrop provides us with a high confidence level in our business trajectory and we're introducing a new mid-term earnings model, which Don will discuss in more detail following his review of our financial results.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Don.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Dave. And thanks for joining us, everyone. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $880.8 million, ahead of our prior guidance of $875 million and up 23% versus the year ago quarter. Gross profit was $440.1 million or 50% of revenue and that's a 100 basis point sequential increase from the June quarter and a 400 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expenses were $104.9 million, consisting of R&D expense of $70.8 million and SG&A expense of $34.1 million. We generated $335.2 million of operating income, up 42% year-over-year, yielding a 38.1% operating margin.", "Below the line, we had expenses of roughly $1.1 million from interest and other expense. Our cash tax rate for the quarter was 11.4%. That's in line with our guidance and resulting in net income of $296.1 million or $1.52 of diluted earnings per share, up 36% year-over-year and $0.01 better than our guidance.", "Turning to our fourth quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement, we generated $233 million in cash flow from operations, invested $151 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $46 million and we exited the quarter with over $1 billion in cash on hand and no debt.", "Moving to our product mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Power amplifiers represented 20% of revenue, integrated mobile systems was 59% and broad markets was 22%. It is worth noting that integrated mobile systems were up 84% year-over-year during the quarter. In Q4, we distributed $160 million to shareholders through our dividend and stock repurchase plans. Our quarterly dividend and ongoing share repurchase activity remain important components of our commitment to return excess free cash flow to shareholders while continuing to fund internal growth initiatives and seek out accretive M&A targets.", "For fiscal 2015, we returned approximately 64% of free cash flow to shareholders, higher than our goal of 40% based on our recent share repurchase activity. Longer term, we continue to view an allocation of roughly 40% of free cash flow as an appropriate balance between internal investment for growth initiatives and shareholder returns.", "Turning to our first quarter fiscal 2016 business outlook, we expect revenue to be between $925 million and $930 million, up 5.3% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. At the midpoint of the range, we anticipate gross margin to be 51%, representing a 430-basis-point year-over-year improvement. We expect our operating expenses to be around $108 million, driven by ongoing investments in engineering and development teams as we expand our footprint within new verticals and further enhance our integration capabilities. We expect first quarter operating margins to exceed 39%.", "Below the line, we anticipate around $900,000 in expenses from interest and other expense and a cash tax rate around 14.5%. For the remainder of fiscal 2016, we recommend modeling a cash tax rate in the 14.5% range. We expect Q1 share count to be around 195 million shares resulting in EPS of $1.60 at the midpoint of the revenue range.", "Our Q1 gross margin guidance exceeds our previous target of 50%, and we are within striking distance of our previously outlined $7.00 EPS target. Given our confidence in our business trajectory, which is driven by visibility into future architectures and our internal gross margin initiatives, we are introducing a new organic midterm model. And that's driven by the following assumptions. First, we continue to see our served market opportunity growing at a mid-teens pace for the foreseeable future based on our ability to address more systems level functionality and expand our footprint.", "Second, we are targeting continued gross margin expansion driven by the positive contribution from our latest generation products, which incorporate higher levels of integration and functionality with greater differentiation, the growth of integrated mobile systems in broad markets product areas as a percentage of our revenue, scale benefits associated with increased volume, continuing efficiency gains from our filter business, and our ongoing efforts to optimize cycle times, yields and supply chain efficiencies.", "And third, we anticipate ongoing R&D investments in systems, engineering and field applications teams to extend our technology advantages and build out our footprint in adjacent vertical markets. The end result is that within a six-quarter to eight-quarter period, we are targeting organic annualized EPS of $8 at a revenue run rate of around $4.5 billion with gross margins in the 53% range. Longer term, based on our internal margin initiatives, we are driving the business towards gross margins in the 55% range on an organic basis.", "So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Don. As we enter fiscal 2016, our deep customer engagements, visibility into future generation architectures, and internal margin enhancement initiatives provide us with a unique perspective on our future growth opportunities, providing a high confidence level in our organic business trajectory.", "Before opening the calls to questions, I'd like to provide a brief update on the acquisition of PMC. On October 30, we announced that we have entered into an amended and restated merger agreement to acquire PMC for $11.60 in cash per share of PMC common stock which we intend to fund through a combination of cash on hand and fully committed debt financing. The agreement has been approved by both boards of directors and is expected to close some time in the first half of calendar 2016. It's worth noting that the acquisition of PMC is additive to the organic $8 midterm model that Don just described and a mid-50%s gross margin goal.", "So in closing, we remain poised to continue outperforming the broader semiconductor market and extending our track record of above-market topline growth, enhanced financial returns and earnings leverage. We've created a unique business model tethered to the global wave of connectivity and combining consistent above-market topline growth with the financial returns of a best-in-class diversified analog company.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question will come from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Go ahead, please.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on the new (14:12).", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. Mike? Hello? We lost you.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hello?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We lost you.", "Operator", "Yeah, so I apologize. Mike, are you there now?", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Okay. Go ahead.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "I'm sorry, can you hear me now?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yep.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay. Sorry about that. Just going to follow-up on the design win activity with marquee customers, you shared this new target which is great to see, the $8 target. One of your competitors today in their press release is talking about securing design activity with marquee smartphones. Is it just that these smartphones are more and more complex and there's more opportunities, or maybe could you just address kind of your comfort and visibility into these marquee customers and design win activity into next year.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think in general, the visibility we have continues to improve because as we mentioned in our prepared comments, we're being invited into the design cycle much, much earlier because we have a bigger footprint, we have a bigger piece of the overall system, and the system requirements are increasingly dependent upon strong analog performance, which is our sweet spot. As a result of that, we are seeing fewer competitors; a definite consolidation of share as we address each customer. So in general, the content is increasing with Wi-Fi functionality, tuning functionality, power management, amplifiers, filters and the like, and we're seeing a narrower competitor base. And so that's why we continue to see \u2013 and teardown reports, for example, will bear this out \u2013 we continue to see increased content with each successive generation of design.", "T. Michael Walkley - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Thanks. Our next question will come from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Go ahead please.", "Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "Afternoon, everybody, and congratulations as well.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Alex.", "Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "I was wondering, Dave, and you're setting a mid-teens growth, does that assume an underlying market growth rate in smartphones consistent with what Qualcomm just outlined yesterday in the low-single digits? And is there room for variance around that? What are the puts and takes around the market doing better than or worse than an underlying low-single digits growth rate?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think when we look at our addressable market, two things are driving it, Alex. One is that we do see \u2013 for example, in China, we're really focused on 4G. We're focused on smartphones and 4G. We've de-emphasized 3G to the extent that it's a standalone product. We don't do any 2G anymore. And so we tend to focus on segments of the market that are at the highest growth that really demand a level of system performance for which we get paid a premium. So we think the growth rate of smartphones and how we address smartphones is a little higher than that.", "And clearly we get a multiplier because we are increasingly addressing on the analog side increasing band content, carrier aggregation, more high functionality Wi-Fi and MIMO and 2x2s, more power management and voltage functions, so we are broader than any of our competitors at the system level. So our content continues to grow, driven by complexity of the device and also we continue to add more blocks of functionality in the overall system.", "Alex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC", "But, Dave, that reminds me of an additional question for you. You've done a great job historically of focusing like you are now on 4G or the key customers. And in going after PMC-Sierra here, it's a company that's gotten caught looking at some legacy type of markets before. How far are you willing to take this bidding war you're in now? It's taken you decades to build up a $1 billion war chest. What's the urgency in going after this now?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as we stated in our earlier remarks, Alex, we do have a definitive agreement. We have our committed financing. We expect to close sometime in first half of 2016. And given that the transaction hasn't yet closed, that's about all we can say.", "The only thing I will add is that, if you look at Skyworks, the sweet spot of what we're very good at, we've been leveraging high-speed data and the consumption in mobility. So it's a natural extension to mobility and connectivity for us to extend into access to the cloud. We think it's just another high-end growth driver that will be both accretive to margin, but also sustainable for a generation.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Cody Acree with Drexel. Go ahead, please.", "Cody G. Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Thanks, guys, for taking my questions and congratulations.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Cody.", "Cody G. Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "You guys went through the summer with a lot of concerns about excess handset inventories. I'd just like to get your view on where the health of inventory is as we head into the holidays.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Cody. Yeah, we actually see inventory levels right now kind of at normal run rate. We have great visibility into our tier-1 accounts. We have visibility into China and other markets and nothing really unusual there. You're right, there was a little bit of a softness at some point earlier in the year, but we feel good about the position today.", "Cody G. Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "And, Dave, just maybe on a strategic question, with your position in filters and the growth in capacity that you've made, what is your long-term strategic objective in filters? Is it a market that you can address with what you have or do you need to get up into the BAW filter territory to really address the opportunities in that market?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's a great question. If you think about the way we're approaching filter technology, it's very much the way we approach semiconductor technology where we try to be as process agnostic as we possibly can and look for the best process for the function. And we've done that very successfully in Wi-Fi and transmit path and power management and so on.", "In the case of filters it's really no different. We don't sell discrete filters. All of our filters are integrated into a higher level system where we're able to leverage our MCM capability, our amplifiers, our switches, our filters to come out with the best overall data handling capability at the lowest current consumption. And we'll continue to do that here. We find that TC SAW has been a wonderful addition in technology for us. We are also extending the advantages of temperature compensated surface acoustic devices to do higher and higher frequency, and frankly picking off bands that were previously only addressable by BAW.", "And with respect to bulk acoustic technology, we do see that there are bands that we're going to need and so between partnerships and our own internal development, we expect to be in production with BAW devices by 2017.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Go ahead, please.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results and strong outlook. The first question is for Dave. Dave, I think it was about 10 months ago or so that you identified that the performance of the business in the fiscal second quarter would behave better than it had historically because of the growth of the broad markets business. Is that still your view?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You mean our fiscal second quarter? Is that what you're talking about, Craig?", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "Yeah, the fiscal second quarter, the calendar March quarter.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The answer is, yes, it is our view. March normal seasonality in the market is down perhaps 8% to 10%. Some customers will be down more. Other customers will likely do better. But despite that, we have a couple of tailwinds. One is that we are consistently adding content. And that quarter will be no different than prior quarters and the quarter we just completed. And broad markets for us is usually better than normal seasonality in March. So our expectation is that we will outpace that normal seasonality in March.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "Thank you. And then the follow-up is for Don. Don, very robust gross margin performance the last two quarters in the outlook. The incremental gross margins, I think, on average around 70% for those three quarters. So, given the strength of the new midterm model, are you suggesting that the business can stay on that trajectory? Or are there things happening in the business that would cause some deviation from the recent strength we've seen in the gross margin line?", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. The way to, Craig, to model that going forward is we still have a high confidence when we take a look at what products we're shipping in the forecast that at a minimum you're going to see a 57%, as we've discussed before, kind of incremental drop-through. What's different as you're looking at our margin profile is that our new product releases in generations as they're shipping, they're tending to have higher margins. And that's based on the integration, based on functionality, based on value to customer. So, you can have some swings in that on the upside, not on the downside, on the upside, as you roll through that.", "So, the best way to do that as we've just given you this 53% six quarters out basically in the new midterm model, so as you roll through the trajectory, I would just take a look at what that drop-through would mean during that period of time, and that's how to model it. That's the best way to do that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Go ahead please.", "Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on another strong quarter. Dave, a question on the gross margins. If I look at other component makers in smartphone market application processor, I mean, those guys are talking about ASP pressures next year, and you guys are planning to expand your gross margin. So help me understand why the pricing environment or the gross margin profile for RF guys should remain strong into next year in a decelerating year-over-year smartphone unit environment?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's relatively simple. It isn't a year-over-year, part-to-part comparison. We are increasingly integrating more functionality as these devices get more complex, and we're seeing fewer competitors able to do it. Customers can't handle discrete components any longer, and that level of integration required to have a product that consumes low current, that's small, that is highly integrated requires many, many different functional blocks with process technology know-how pulled together in a low-cost manufacturing platform with great system architectures.", "So, we are able to work with our customers to give them a differentiated system performance which is increasingly becoming analog and RF dependent; less digital and more analog and RF dependent, and that's our sweet spot. And so our customers it isn't as if that we're charging our customers more, per se, per function, it's that they're giving us more of the system requirement and they're paying us for it because we've generated we add a great deal of value for them.", "Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. And as a follow-up, on your last call you guys talked about selling one 1 billion plus TC SAW filter units this fiscal year and 1.2 billion end of this calendar year. If you can update us on those numbers and what your expectations are for next year.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Sure, yes, we are actually well on the way to beat our estimate on TC SAW production. We will exit the calendar year over 1.2 billion in TC SAW devices. And as Dave articulated, all of those devices are being consumed internally by these highly complex system architectures. So we're wrapping up multiple bands, very, very high precision devices that allow our customers to put best-in-class solutions into their products. So it's a great opportunity. It's early innings. We continue to invest and fund and CapEx. We expect another very strong year in 2016 for our filter integrated solutions, and it's a great opportunity for us and our customers.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Go ahead, please.", "Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, thanks. And I'll add my congratulations, guys.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Thanks, Rick.", "Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "My first question just was curious if you guys could provide some color or some early color on how you see the March quarter shaping up? Are there any factors at play we should be thinking about that would make it better or worse than what we've seen over the last couple of years?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I don't think so. Maybe Liam could chime in. Again, as I mentioned a moment ago, we think the markets down 8% to 10%, I think what you're maybe getting at is we do see the opportunity for OEM share shifts. We've factored that into our forecasts. We understand that. We have a great deal of experience with all of our large OEM customers. So we're able to sort of understand their buying and consumption patterns. So we think we handicapped that in a very conservative fashion. I don't think that's an issue for us. Our broad markets continue to add not only content, but add more new opportunities for us, which are growing sequentially each quarter, and we don't think March will be any different than that.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Yes, exactly. I think that's the real change is that the broad market portfolio continues to grow. It's highly diversified. We go from connected home to broad IoT devices, starting to even move it in markets like automotive. So there's a segment of our company now that really doesn't revolve around that typical seasonality in the March quarter. So we hopefully can do a great deal of work to offset the normal cycle.", "Rick E. Schafer - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then just as my follow-up, maybe can you comment on the content trends with some of the China smartphone OEMs? I know Apple's success there is it having any sort of noticeable impact on the RF content complexity plans for sort of the second gen 4G phones from the big China OEMs? And if there's any way you can put numbers to that or give a sense of if you've got sort of in the $4 of content on average now, what that might look like in the next year or two?", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Yes. No, that's a great question. And we certainly look at the China opportunity as a long-term secular trend for Skyworks. So we're going to do very well. We've been doing well. And as you've articulated, the 4G cycle is significantly meaningful. We do address that with the global Tier 1s. You named a few, as well as the local brands, and what we've been seeing is that the local providers; names like Huawei, names like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo have now become much more comfortable with developing the higher-end solutions in 4G. It's a major content gain for us when you compare with the 3G devices where we may have $1 or $1.25 of opportunity. Now we move to $3 to $4.", "And it's not just traditional transmit devices. It's receive side technology, there's Wi-Fi technology, there's power, there's GPS. So it's a powerful cycle. There's going be some share shifts in that market. Not everyone is going to win. The local brands are sorting it out. We see three or four companies emerging. The foreign brands, the global players will participate. But one of the things to note about Skyworks is we're highly diversified. We're diversified with the China brands, we're diversified with the global brands, and we'll do well in that market as it grows.", "Operator", "Thank you. We now have a question from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Vincent D. Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. This is Vince Celentano in for Steve. Going back to the broad markets, it looks like you guys grew around mid-teens this year. Given the growth in wearables and as you're saying the content growth in networking gear, do you think this mid-teens growth is kind of a sustainable growth rate for 2016? Or are you expecting more growth because of that? And in general, what are the main drivers you see determining what happens?", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Yes. No, absolutely. So the broad market, it's getting quite exciting because it's really the sum of many, many different segments. We talked a lot about our Wi-Fi business and access point and connected home, and now you do have the emergence of markets like wearables. And what we're seeing in those markets is early stage it's been relatively light duty with respect to connectivity. They may incorporate Wi-Fi. We have ZigBee, we even have Bluetooth products that are participating through that space.", "But we're starting to look further out in architectures with lead customers, and they're bringing in higher levels of complexity even in wearables and IoT devices. We're seeing LTE being embedded in solutions that will launch in the back half of 2016. So it's very early innings for mass adoption with consumers, but it's quite likely that the content trends that we've observed in smartphones could play out in IoT as well and in wearables.", "Vincent D. Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then just a quick line item question. Was there any particular reason for the jump in accounts receivable this quarter?", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. Our DSO for the quarter was the same as Q2. Q3 and Q4 were around 43 days. It was just the timing of when the revenue shipped in the quarter. That's all it was. It's not a collection or velocity issue.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. We have a question from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Go ahead please.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter and guide.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Thank you.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Thanks. Couple of questions on the TC SAW side. Obviously it's doing 120%, 140% year-on-year it looks like. How much capacity are you adding in RF as we look into next year?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we've added about a tripling of capacity with the new factory, Hitachi glass factory we acquired, we've been outfitting. That's why you saw a little bit of increase in the capital. So we're beginning to ship into that new factory and we'll see a good doubling of expansion.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Yeah, and further to that, think of this as a high performance filter site, all topology. So bulk acoustic wave opportunities, temperature compensated surface acoustic wave, standard surface acoustic wave. It is a first-class facility and we're funding it in the right way. We've got great people, qualified proven people. We're upping our game in design engineering. We've got a war chest of IP. So this is going to be a real driver, a competitive driver, for us.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, and just to clarify, the new facility is a leased facility. It wasn't a big CapEx investment for us. The equipment we're investing in, but the facility itself is just a lease.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got it. And just briefly, I know it's been asked before, but as you look at 2016, your comfort at the content growth in the marquee phones? Thanks.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's very high. We have really quite good visibility and it's really a function of two things. One is that the content in general is going up as more bands are brought to market, more carrier aggregation bands, more sophisticated Wi-Fi, more voltage and power challenges that need to be solved in the analog functionality. So we're able to do that. And we have increasingly been able to put more functional blocks on the table to try to sweep in more, whether it's in our module or at the IC level. So I feel very comfortable that this increasing content generation over generation will continue.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Go ahead please.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hello?", "Operator", "Mr. Snyder, your line is open. Okay. We will move on then to Mike Burton with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter, especially in this environment. First for Don, great execution on the margin front and a nice update there. Sorry I missed it, but did you say that we should be using a 57% contribution margin going forward? And then what are the puts and takes for OpEx as we go through the next fiscal year relative to normal seasonality and planned program ramps?", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Mike, as far as the drop-through, if you were to look at going from the guide we just gave to December to the target revenue quarter of $1.125 billion and you looked at 51% to 53% and you just did the drop-through on that volume change, it's 62%. Why I'm saying use the 57% is because it's going be a little different than that in that it's based on the timing of shipments. So there may be some quarters it will be a little higher than that. I would just look at that timeframe and then you can smooth that out over that. But if you just did it on a straight-line basis, it would be 62%. There's going be some quarters it could be 57% and 70%. So that's why I'm answering the question I am. But it's all good news, obviously.", "Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay. And then on the OpEx side?", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I would say to model that the way we've done it and when you look for six quarters out, we're adding about $3.5 million a quarter in OpEx.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Thanks, guys. This is Richard. Let me echo my congratulations as well.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Unknown Speaker", "Wanted to talk about the broad markets. Clearly the IoT market is going crazy. Could you quantify kind of the CAGR you're seeing there? And then in terms of your automotive strategy, can you talk about your design wins there? And then when should we start to see the acceleration of revenues?", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Sure. So within broad markets, this last year we grew about 20% year-over-year with all segments. The IoT elements and segments have been the fastest growers. So we have IoT growing faster than that 20% and then we have some markets, like infrastructure, that have been a little slower, but net-net you get the 20%. We think that's sustainable. We're adding new customers. There's a roster of names that we participated with this year. We talked about some of the marquee solutions with Google's OnHub and other devices.", "Automotive, we're starting to get design wins in a couple of places. We started with some of the infotainment-like solutions with Wi-Fi and power management in-dash. More recently, we've seen customers adopt LTE-based roaming hot spots, if you will, and gobble up a great deal of 4G technology. Those solutions will be shipping later in 2016. It's still very early for us and automotive is still a new market for Skyworks. But, yeah, you should expect a lot more there from each of the segments, the traditional IoT, the connected home and then eventually more on the auto side.", "Unknown Speaker", "That's very helpful. Thank you for that color. And then in terms of the December quarter guidance, what are the puts and takes to get to your guidance level on revenues?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, this is Dave. December is normally a strong quarter for us. It's a holiday seasonal ramp. We'll continue to grow within emerging market LTE upgrade cycle. We've got some nice content. We've got really good position with the SoC partners. I think we'll see another strong broad markets quarter, particularly in the connected home and in IoT. This will be offset a little bit maybe by some of the markets we address like industrial, as we see a little softness there. But net-net broad markets will be up in December. So we're guiding revenue up to be about 15% year-over-year, margins will expand, and as Don mentioned, strong earnings leverage.", "Unknown Speaker", "Great. Thanks, guys. And congratulations.", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Thanks.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for taking my question. And I'll echo my congratulations. Very good results and guidance despite all the noise and headwinds in the markets. It's good to see that.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Vivek.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So maybe as my first one, Dave, I'm trying to understand if let's say for whatever reason growth shifts from your large marquee customer to, let's say, customers in China, how is Skyworks positioned? And is it fair to think that when I look at your absolute content, it may be roughly similar in both situations because at the large marquee customer you probably have less share and a higher bill of materials, whereas at the Chinese customers you may have higher share and a lower bill of materials? So is it possible there is that kind of balancing? So even if growth shifts from one class to the other, you can still continue to do well?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think, yes, we can continue to do well. I think we continue to do very well because content is going up across our customer base. It's interesting that you commented on it's kind of winner-take-all with some of these indigenous providers or rather OEMs within China and our content is going up among those. So I think it really remains to be seen, but it has been the case that the leaders in the smartphone space have been driving technology that has been later adopted by others. So there's a little bit of a time delay, but I think your thesis is fine.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And as my follow-up, even after you complete the announced PMC acquisition, you'll still have a relatively strong balance sheet and low leverage. How do you think about uses of cash and the debt capacity given where the stock is right now versus what you think is a strong growth trajectory as you look at next year?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, I think with respect to M&A, you're right, we'll have light leverage and we will have an opportunity to pay it down very, very fast because, as you've seen, we're a very strong cash generator. We generate a lot of free cash flow at Skyworks. And so if I look at the long-term, we continue and will continue to look for accretive acquisitions that have a couple of characteristics. One is they have stickiness to the end customers. So there's a technology envelope or market being addressed that is highly valued where we can leverage perhaps customer relationships, manufacturing expertise, process know-how, system capability and create solutions that have a great deal of value.", "We're also looking for opportunities to leverage our position in mobile and connectivity for adjacent markets \u2013 vertical markets if you will \u2013 that again have those same characteristics. We're very interested in looking for analog opportunities that are outside of our current target market scope and look for logical extensions where we can continue to increase margins, while having more legs to the stool, if you will.", "Donald W. Palette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, and, Vivek, just to follow on that. So, as Dave said, if you look at our EBITDA and our strong cash flow, we certainly have the powder to lever up more than the said deals. PMC would be about 1.2 times EBITDA. So we'll have room to grow if we so desired. We like the 40% return to the shareholders, so we'll continue to look at annual dividend increases. That's a smart play for us. And then we'll do opportunistic share buyback. So that's the right formula, because obviously we could take that number up, but we think the best long-term value is to continue to focus on how we're going to grow the top line of the business. So that's the balance that we're trying to strike.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. Go ahead, please.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.", "Thank you. Sorry about that. So a couple things. First, Dave, you guys did better on the Phase II MediaTek than I think a lot of people had anticipated here, and first wanted to confirm that that was something like SkyLiTE, correct? And does it represent an increase in RF content both for that platform, the last one and for Skyworks? And is that the trend you're seeing in even the white-box guys at this point?", "Liam K. Griffin - President", "Ed, yes, this is Liam. That's a great pickup on that. We did win some meaningful share with MediaTek and it is our SkyLiTE product line. And what SkyLiTE is, actually, is think of it as our SkyOne ex-filters. So there's a couple of themes there. The content with MediaTek on those platforms is going be an upgrade from where we were on the prior region, but overtime, if you can envision, if we start to develop our filter strategy and our integration strategy with a company like MediaTek taking the SkyLiTE and now embedding high-performance filters, you could see a real pop in opportunity. And it's something that our chipset partners want to see. So yes, you called that correctly with the technology. We're happy with the position. We love MediaTek. We've worked with them for years. They were a little late to the game in 4G, but as you've seen, they're accelerating gains.", "Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.", "And then you're talking a lot about BAW here and I know you guys work \u2013 this is an FBAR type process I think it is. Is it not? And did Panasonic have IP in that? Or do you think you'd cross over anything that Avago has got here? How do you feel about the IP situations, given that there's only two other guys doing this right now?", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Panasonic has, as you can imagine, a great deal of fundamental IP around filters in general. And so filters have been around for a long time, bulk acoustic filters have been around a long time as have surface acoustic filters, and so we have a lot of IP in filters. And Panasonic brought us a great deal of expertise and leverage.", "Operator", "Okay. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Aldrich for any closing remarks.", "David J. Aldrich - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much for listening and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences.", "Operator", "Okay. Thank you.

With me on the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Liam Griffin and Chief Financial Officer, Don Palette.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and other SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-Q, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss today are from our non-GAAP income statement, consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Liam.", "Liam Griffin", "Thanks, Mitch and welcome everyone. Q3 marked another quarter of solid execution on the part of the Skyworks team. We exceeded our guidance, returned over $240 million in cash to our shareholders, and importantly, continued to broaden our design win pipeline, setting the stage for sustained market outperformance.", "Looking at the results in more detail, we delivered revenue of $752 million ahead of our guidance; expanded gross margins to 50.9%, up 190 basis points year-over-year; produced operating income of $275 million, with operating margins over 36%. Finally, we generated $1.24 in earnings per share, $0.03 above consensus. Execution on revenue and margins, along with operating cost discipline were all key elements of this performance. In addition to the strong financial results, we continued to gain broad market traction. Specifically during the quarter, we powered Huawei\u2019s P9 phone, incorporating 10 unique devices, including our SkyOne systems across low, mid and high bands; launched advanced carrier aggregation capabilities across a suite of premium and value tier accounts, including Samsung, Motorola as well as Oppo, Vivo and ZTE. We secured design wins for Continental\u2019s 4G LTE automotive systems, captured digital attenuator and multimode repeater designs at Audi, and enabled enterprise radio for Google\u2019s 3.5 gigahertz band ecosystem.", "We also achieved several other milestones, including surpassing production of 2 billion filters cumulatively from our joint venture with Panasonic; ramping SkyBlue innovative technology for enhanced power management in LED flash drivers; commencing volume production of proprietary diversity received solutions and supporting the world\u2019s first headcam with LTE connectivity in 4k video streaming. These major wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the Internet of Things.", "At this point, I will turn the call over to Don for a more in depth review of our financial results.", "Don Palette", "Thanks, Liam and thanks again for joining us, everyone. We appreciate it. Revenue for the third quarter was $751.7 million and that\u2019s ahead of our guidance. Gross profit was $382.3 million or 50.9% of revenue and that\u2019s in line with our guidance and up 190 basis points from the third quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.6 million. That consists of R&D expense of $70.2 million and SG&A expense of $37.4 million. We generated $274.7 million of operating income, translating into a 36.5% operating margin.", "Our cash tax rate was 12.7%, resulting in net income of $238.1 million or $1.24 diluted earnings per share, $0.03 ahead of our guidance. Our cash tax rate is now projected lower for fiscal 2016 at 14%. The Q3 rate was favorably impacted by a year-to-date adjustment from the prior 14% \u2013 14.7% annual rate.", "Turning to a summary of our third fiscal quarter cash flow metrics, we invested $57 million in capital expenditures with depreciation of $54.6 million, generated $141 million in cash flow from operations. We returned over $240 million to shareholders via dividends and the repurchase of 3 million shares during the quarter. Looking at product mix for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, integrated mobile systems was 55% of revenue, broad markets was 29% and power amplifiers was 16%.", "Now, moving on to our fourth fiscal quarter business outlook. Based on the broad market traction, our new program ramps as well as the content gains Liam has outlined, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be up 10% to 11% sequentially to $831 million at the midpoint. The double-digit revenue growth we expect in Q4 followed by continued growth into our first fiscal quarter will reduce inventory. We have level loaded our factories and positioned ourselves well to address a series of new filter-rich program ramps with leading customers. For fiscal Q4, we suggest modeling gross margin at 51%. It\u2019s worth noting that our Q4 gross margin guidance implies a 100 basis point improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter even with a lower revenue base.", "Looking at OpEx, we expect R&D and SG&A expenses to be flat with Q3, reflecting continued cost structure discipline. Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses, a cash tax rate of 14%. We expect share count to be roughly 190 million shares, driving fourth fiscal quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.43. Lastly, we also announced today that our Board has authorized an 8% dividend increase and a new 400 million stock repurchase program, underscoring the confidence we have in our business model and our ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders.", "And with that, I will turn the call back over to Liam.", "Liam Griffin", "Thanks, Don. Our third quarter execution highlights our differentiated competitive positioning and the strength of our business model. We are levered to powerful secular technology forces and we have spent the last decade aligning the company to capitalize on these strategic macro trends, propelling our mobile IoT and broad market opportunity. First is the explosive growth of mobile data across the vast set of applications and usage cases, driving performance from device to cloud and beyond. Next, we are seeing an ever-increasing expansion of connected things, with tens of billions of newly connected devices brought to market over the next 5 years. And finally, we address a tremendous ecosystem and new economy that thrives on the ability to leverage high-speed and secure connectivity at the heart of their business. Enabling these connections is the sweet spot of our franchise.", "In mobile, we have growing content positions across all of the world\u2019s premier OEMs, leveraging our unique capabilities to meet our customers\u2019 increasing need for higher performance solutions. We are also building momentum in broad markets, particularly in IoT, with engagements at leading players, including Amazon, ARRIS, Cisco, Fitbit, GE, Google Nest, Honeywell, Itron, LG and others. Our success here has been brought about by a broad and growing list of wins in adjacent markets like industrial, energy management, security, health and fitness and the smart home. Today, we participate in all of these verticals through our suite of diverse technologies, including support for WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, GPS, small cell and LTE standards. At the same time, we are building presence in key verticals like automotive, with leaders such as Continental, Audi, Ford, Kia, GM and Volkswagen.", "Underpinning all of our solutions is the skyrocketing demand for wireless data. Whether it\u2019s Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google or Tesla, there is a powerful and expanding ecosystem, monetizing and relying upon efficient, high speed, low latency, seamless and secure connections. This ecosystem spans across enterprise to e-commerce to social media and a burgeoning set of entirely new applications fueled by connectivity. In an effort to facilitate this massive and growing wave of data delivery, creation and movement in storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, received diversity, MIMO and ultimately 5G capabilities. This dynamic requires a continuous increase in the levels of analog and mixed signal performance, enhanced power efficiency, high-precision filtering as well as configurable systems integration capabilities. Skyworks\u2019 suite of products and system solutions are squarely aimed at resolving the intense performance demands facing our customers.", "So to summarize, we delivered above guidance results in the quarter, driven by increasing global demand for high speed connectivity coupled with strong operational execution. And as our guidance reflects, we are planning for sustained market outperformance with operating leverage and strong cash flow generation. Clearly, we remain well positioned to realize our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let\u2019s open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is Charles on for Toshiya Hari. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering with inventory at these levels, can you kind of walk through some of the content and unit assumptions that underpin your confidence in being able to get inventories down going into Q1?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. Well, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, lot of that inventory is filter driven and really filters that are designed into known programs with known ramps in the second half, not only transmit solutions, but also receipt side technologies, some GPS technologies and an expanding set of customers now that will be taking those filters and those solutions into their applications. So the lion\u2019s share of that material, that inventory, largely filters is really lined up relative to second half ramps with known customers so and a very clear demand curve.", "Don Palette", "And just to follow-up generically on the inventory and just keep in mind that that inventory growth that you are seeing in the Q3 is it supports the second half. Volumes were up about 11% quarter-over-quarter and then there is growth as we continue in the fiscal Q1 of \u201817. There were multiple things that Liam was talking about burning the inventory down. I am just going to give you the summary of why the level is where it\u2019s at. The level, we were level loading factories to meet that second half demand. The share gains in filters especially silicon is driven by new programs. There is specific growth assigned to some ramps and there is essentially no risk with any of \u2013 risk with this inventory. We also had a new hub arrangement for a large customer in Asia. That\u2019s a one-time stocking bump in inventory. And some of the projected product mix into Q4 just has longer lead times for some of the outsourced materials and it\u2019s primarily silicon wafer. So the bottom line, we are very confident in the decline going forward and getting the turns back towards historical levels. So this is a short-term issue that we are working through based on those dynamics.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then as a follow-up, I guess with the \u2013 given the buyback, could you just maybe run through some of your thoughts on M&A and your strategy on diversification via M&A?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. Well, I mean we first and foremost are committed to running our core business. And we think there is great opportunity to leverage not only our strength in mobile, but now you are hearing more and more about our opportunities in broad market, specifically IoT. So we are committed to that. Now in parallel, we have a disciplined view on M&A, but we certainly are looking at potential opportunities. We will share more with you as they come about. But we are focused on our core, but have the powder, the balance sheet and the opportunity to certainly augment that with M&A as needed.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Vivek Arya", "Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, Liam I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of the overall demand environment, obviously the industry has come through an inventory correction at your largest customer, are we past all those problems, so now we should start to expect more normalized growth, if you could address that. And also if you could take it more broadly to the trends you are seeing at your Korean and Chinese customers, I think basically, I think investors want to understand, are we past some of the issues we saw in the first half and it\u2019s a more normalized growth environment going forward or is the industry still struggling with a little bit of the inventory issues that came about in the first half?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, Vivek. I will take both of those questions. Well yes, I mean we have been through a challenging first half of the calendar year, for sure. And I think that\u2019s been well publicized and reflected in our numbers in the past. We are seeing improving conditions right now. We are seeing all of our Tier 1s grow. And more importantly, we are seeing our content position expand and their need for the content expand. So the dynamic around performance and our ability to resolve performance with systems level solutions is coming together quite well. And you can see in this guide 10% to 11%, pretty solid guide up into Q4. We feel that that\u2019s sustainable. We expect \u2013 so early for Q1, but we do expect to be up again into Q1, so that\u2019s kind of a broad statement. And if you look at China and Samsung, both of those opportunities, China being more of a broad opportunity with some of the flagship names like Huawei doing very, very well for us and China will be one of our faster growing areas. Samsung, we got content gains on the GS7. That\u2019s looking good this year. Samsung will be probably a 15%-plus account for us year-over-year. We are lining out for the GS8. So what you can look at here at a high level is this continuous need for performance and Skyworks\u2019 ability to address not only our core positions in SkyOne and some of the transmit chain, but also an increasing position in analog and increasing position in the receive side, WiFi and other technologies that will allow us to grow our share.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Atif Malik", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. A question on the gross margins, I mean your gross margin were a smidge below the 51% guidance you gave, even with the higher revenue level and broad markets doing better and your guidance of 51% is flat on higher revenue, can you just talk about incremental gross margins, we have not seen these lower committed gross margins in the last like six quarters, so can you talk about the puts and takes on your gross margin line and should we be thinking about 60% incremental gross margins moving forward and also a 53% mid-term model that you have shared in the past? And I have a follow-up.", "Don Palette", "Yes, sure. We will talk about the incremental contribution margin that we saw in Q3, being that that was a down revenue quarter, was actually a number that was very good in the high 40s. And when you are in down revenue, you want the number to be below which you are normally posting, so that\u2019s good. When you do look at the guidance, we are at about 52.5% on an incremental basis and that\u2019s simply reflective of the backdrop, the unique elements that we highlighted in the Q4 inventory. Going forward when you are looking at our earnings model opportunity, the 53% is absolutely still our target. And we expect these incremental margins very, very quickly to get back to the 58% kind of level, which is what we have communicated consistently externally. So there is no issues there. We are just working through this the inventory issues and the tough backdrop issues that Liam mentioned, but nothing else specific.", "Atif Malik", "Great. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the low, mid and high socket wins in the Huawei phone, can you just talk about why we don\u2019t see you in mid and high band in some of the other flagship models in India and Korea and in the U.S. and if you guys are planning to get to those sockets or maybe the specifications of the Huawei phones are different than those other devices? Thanks.", "Liam Griffin", "Yes. No, that\u2019s a great question. So first off, I will tell you we are encroaching some of the mid and high bands organically with enhanced performance in our TC SAW factory. And as noted in the prepared remarks, we have shipped over 2.5 billion filters, all of which were consumed by our systems solution. So we are not a discrete filter company. Having said that, our performance levels not only with the filter, but the entirety of the system, so if you think about what customers want from us is they want solutions that resolve this tremendous complexity. And those solutions from Skyworks are really system level. They include our own gallium arsenide HBT process that we have in-house, our SOI process, our deep IP and switching, our ability to craft MCMs for very, very low loss and high efficiency, delivering a complete module. So our modules can often include our own TC SAW. We have been able to move the TC frequency up to mid-band. And in some cases, if the frequencies are not applicable for TC SAW we can address by our foundry partners for bulk. So that\u2019s what you are seeing now in the Huawei phone. I think you will continue to see us extend our reach in frequencies and continue to do what customers want, really simplify their solutions, give them the best end-to-end efficiency and the best systems level performance.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question, it comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Thanks a lot. I guess I am still trying to understand the inventory. You said that you are building ahead of the ramp, but the revenue is guided down like $50 million year-over-year at the midpoint. So, I would have thought that if you are building for more content gains that you would think that the revenue guidance would have been a little bit better year-over-year. So, is the answer really that it\u2019s going to sell through more in the fourth calendar quarter? Because I guess if you could commit to a big up fourth calendar quarter, then the inventory build would make a little more sense. I am wondering if you can comment on that? Thanks.", "Don Palette", "Part of the sell-through, you will see both the Q4 and then into Q1 as well. You will see both of those, so that\u2019s clearly part of it.", "Liam Griffin", "Yes. And then also just recall that we have 3x the size of our filter franchise so to speak. When we get the deal with Panasonic, we had one site in Kadoma. We have added a large site in Osaka. We have many more customers now that are engaged with us with filter-based solutions. So, we are running that larger factory, running that larger footprint in high-performance filters, there is more WIP, there is more inventory, and there is more programs by which we are going to sell into. So, that\u2019s the difference when you look at year-over-year. The size of our filter franchise is quite a bit bigger. The number of customers that we address is quite a bit larger. And specifically in the second half calendar year, you are going to see that action come to bear and we are going to see the inventories come down as well.", "Don Palette", "I am sorry, one thing that I wanted to add to is that when you look at the build that we had this quarter it\u2019s all raw materials and WIP. There is literally no finished goods build, very little. So, that just supports that future growth opportunity.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Blayne Curtis", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just when you look at the September guidance, just trying to better understand what you are embedding in there, if you can talk about what you think broad markets will do into September? And then assuming that\u2019s not down a ton, it looks like the integrated mobile is down year-over-year. Obviously, your largest customer has a got unit headwind to deal with. You have content gains offsetting. Is there any other headwinds that you are dealing with in integrated mobile?", "Liam Griffin", "Well, I mean I think for the most part if you look at the quarter here, we are speaking Q4 guide, we are still \u2013 there is some headwind in some ways of mix, legacy mix SAW that it really hasn\u2019t come to bear. But we have factored that in. We are seeing overall growth. If you were to exclude our largest customer, we are up 10% to 12% year-over-year in the quarter. So, I mean, some of the headwinds with our larger customers still are reflected in our numbers. We are growing the non-core PAB business quite well and that\u2019s IoT. That\u2019s diverse and you received technologies that are quite new for us. Our WiFi business is strong. All those portfolios look very good on a year-over-year basis. And we are starting to get out of the inventory hold that we mentioned with some of our larger customers. And things definitely look better in the second half with respect to that.", "Blayne Curtis", "Liam, just on broad markets, you had a very strong quarter in June despite the divestiture was up. Could you just talk about the trajectory down into September?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, will be up a little bit in September, probably 5% to 8%. I will tell you this though within broad market, IoT is it will be up 10% to 15%. And year-over-year, IoT is probably headed for high-teens. So within the broad market space, what you have there, Blayne, is some markets that are doing quite well IoT. We also have some legacy markets like infrastructure that are great markets and have super margin, but just have been flattish in terms of top line. So, the blend together looks good, but IoT is the sweet spot within broad. It\u2019s really special for us right now.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie of Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Steve Smigie", "Great. Thanks a lot. You introduced a whole bunch of new products here such as the digital attenuators and antenna tuning, etcetera. Can you talk a little bit about how much of your content on the phone now comes from outside of pad type device? I know there is lots of SKUs out there, but just trying to get a sense of how broad you are getting now across the phone outside of just some more classic parts?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, no, that\u2019s a great \u2013 I don\u2019t have an exact stat for you, but I will tell you, it\u2019s definitely increased over the last year and it will increase in the second half of this year. Some examples you have mentioned us talk about diversity you received. I mean, this is some real elegant proprietary technology that Skyworks has created. It levers our filter technology. It levers our LNA, low noise amplifier expertise, our switching and again that configurability with our own MCM. Great technology and what it does is just tremendous, tremendous improvements in the downlinks portion of the phone. And if you think about the way typical usage cases that broke on phone, downlink is critical. So, we provided great enhancement to downlink speed. That\u2019s one area that is relatively new for us and it should be a big growth driver. Some of the SkyBlue technology that we mentioned before is unique for us, driving power efficiency through the system. We have had WiFi for quite a while, but now what we are starting to see is MIMO WiFi in some of the leading flagship phones. Our content virtually can double with MIMO. There is a lot of great things happening, antenna tuning and other points, GPS for location-based services. If you think about we have talked about the ecosystem with some of the big tech players now engaged in mobile, a lot of these folks are involved in payment. They want to know exactly where people are, precise location. We have a GPS portfolio now that is really emerging and increasing attach rate with some of our customers. So, all those things blend in. And you are seeing definitely a larger increase in kind of the nontraditional pad business, although that remains core, but a bigger swing now to some of these newer devices.", "Steve Smigie", "Okay, great. Thanks. And I was just wondering, I mean obviously as other folks mentioned, it\u2019s been a little tough with some big customers out there being challenged, but do you have some sense of when you think you may \u2013 what quarter you might return to year-over-year growth rates?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, year-over-year \u2013 okay, so \u201816 to \u201815?", "Steve Smigie", "Right, yes. So, I mean, is it possible to say like March of \u201817, would that be a quarter where we would expect to start to see sort of year-over-year growth rates resuming?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, yes absolutely. Okay, I got your question now. Yes. I mean, certainly, we get through the second half year. Obviously, we are coming off of a $752 million, 10% up. We expect to be up again in Q1. We don\u2019t have a full guide yet for that quarter. But I think when we get into the March quarter we should be back on track with year-over-year growth. And then just also just to remind you, I think we mentioned it before, but even in the September quarter, we are looking at comparable levels of operating income percentage, so comparable levels of profitability even at lower revenue. So, it has been a challenging period for us, the last couple of quarters. But I think you can see some financial discipline here at least in the P&L.", "Don Palette", "Yes. And you will see sort of normal sequential growth pattern starting again, but the year-over-year, as Liam says, is going to be in the second quarter when we see that.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Edward Snyder at Charter Equity. Please go ahead.", "Edward Snyder", "Thanks a lot. Filters, you mentioned over 200 \u2013 or 2 billion of those filters, but probably like 37 are TC SAW. Is the big expansion in Panasonic facility all for TC SAW, Liam or would you get into SAW manufacturing? And if you do, how is that going to impact the GM, because I know think you are finding those on the outside world now? And then the second question, on the competitive environment when you are done, please?", "Liam Griffin", "Okay. No, a great question. So, yes, certainly the filters that we produce thus far have largely been TC SAW. And as you know well, I mean that as a flavor of high-performance filters that\u2019s in high demand and it\u2019s allowed us to lever that up into SkyOne systems for low and in some cases, mid-band. And it\u2019s been served us very well. Now, going back to standard SAW filters is actually quite easy. It\u2019s fewer process steps. You will eliminate the silicon dioxide plating. It\u2019s a cheaper process for us. And you are correct that we do still spend quite a bit of money outside for a third-party SAW. So, there is potential opportunity for us to bring that in-house. And then finally that site in Osaka has the ability. It\u2019s a phenomenal site, class 10 clean-room, beautiful facility and we do have the opportunity to expand further and higher frequencies if needed.", "Edward Snyder", "Okay. And then you are clearly number one in TC SAW, but by a distant margin here. So, it sounds like your expansion plans are going to be even further. Now, in the competitive environment, I mean it seems like it\u2019s shifting pretty dramatically here. Marotta has already stated this losing share to largest customer this year. And it looks like that\u2019s all to you, but then you are also splitting the little [indiscernible] with Qorvo. You didn\u2019t do that last year. Qorvo has also entered the DRx section at Samsung where they weren\u2019t last year. So, how do you see, Liam, the competitive environment shaking out in say, calendar year 2017? Are the Japanese firm which are disappearing, I mean, you guys got Panasonic [indiscernible] \u2013 are they going to disappear faster than say Qorvo shows up at some of these sockets? And is all this going to be kind of a footnote to overall TAM growth in the RF section in \u201817? I am just trying to get your view of the bigger picture. Thanks.", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, yes, that\u2019s a lot. Let me try to help you with that. So, I will tell you what we see. We see the performance nodes going up and up and up, with each successive generation whether it be our largest customer over the next two or three down, we really see that happening. And that\u2019s actually \u2013 that\u2019s propelled our growth more than anything, our ability to hit the more challenging architectures and do it with profitable solutions and integrated solutions that served us very, very well. We are confident that you will be able to see content gains with all of the leading accounts, regardless of baseband partitioning. We are agnostic to baseband. We work with Qualcomm. We work with Intel. We work with MediaTek, Hisilicon, all of those players. And so we don\u2019t expect any issue with that. But yes, competitively the companies that can hit the performance and the companies that can do that elegantly and unburden our customers with these daunting challenges that they are facing, those are the ones that are going to win and we will be at the top of that list. I mean that\u2019s the whole essence of Skyworks to try to drive a strategy around performance, integrate as much as we can, work with our customers, listen to what they need, it may be different. Every account wants something different, but be flexible enough, leveraging our internal capabilities, leveraging [indiscernible] for highly configurable devices, picking the right flavor of filter, but really looking at systems performance from input to output. If we do that well, our business will follow.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Cody Acree of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Cody Acree", "Thanks for taking my question. And maybe just continuing on that theme with your expansion in capacity and really seeing significant expansion at Qorvo and at Broadcom as well, are you concerned at all about the supply-demand balance of this industry as we get that over the next few quarters?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes. Cody, its funny if you look at what is happening in these devices now, it is incredible. The filter count that is absolutely required by our customers and just by virtue of the crowded spectrum that we see. So there is going to be I think a shake on who is going to wind and who isn\u2019t going to win based on how we put those filters into a complete system. Our customers really are less interested in buying discrete components today and more interested on those highly efficient engines that we spoke of. So we are very confident with our ability to address and as you know from history with Skyworks, we are very disciplined on our CapEx and we are careful with where we invest. So we certainly know where our filter strategy is going and our ability to win. And with respect our competition, we have competed with Avago and Qorvo and others for years and years and we certainly like our outlook here at Skyworks.", "Cody Acree", "And just trying to get maybe a little clearer picture on the September guide, I know you have been asked and answered these questions about inventory, but do you believe that you are still dealing with anything that\u2019s either causing you to be conservative or weighing a bit on that 10% to 11% guide, you got obviously there a major customer build that you are prepping for, you got some seasonality happening, you got what appears to be a relatively healthy market in China, maybe I think I am just a bit surprised that this wasn\u2019t a bit stronger guide?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. Yes. I mean 10% to 11% is I think is a pretty healthy move up for us. Yes. There has been of course some lingering effects of legacy platforms that we have had to manage through and that is be managed through, so all of that is reflected in the numbers. I will tell you one thing that we really need to highlight here again is absent our largest customer, we are up 10% to 12% year-over-year. And also across mobile, we are specifically expanding our content reach. It was a question that was asked earlier on the call. But the percentage of revenue we derive in mobile with technologies that are really more like analog mix signal, that percentage is going up. Our IoT business looks very strong right now, our broad market business looks very strong. It\u2019s been a tough opening two quarters of the calendar year, quite frankly. And we are coming out of that now. Is there some lingering headwinds that are reflected in the number, yes possibly so, but that\u2019s in the guide.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question, it comes from the line of Anthony Stoss of Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Stoss", "Hi guys. Just drilling down with further Liam on China, can you talk about how much it was up in June, do you expect it to be up also in the September quarter, what percent in China currently makes for your business overall total revenues and what you think the inventory in the channel looks like in the China? Thanks.", "Liam Griffin", "Sure Tony. Well at a high level, China is about 25% of our company revenue. And they were up sequentially more than 10%. They look good in the second half calendar year. I think one of the accounts that we highlighted in the prepared remarks was Huawei. We have got a great position there, not only with the P9 phone that we mentioned, but with the Honor series and others. There is also another opportunity in China I think most of you know. But China is a tremendous export player to the rest of the world and there are still 2 billion to 3 billion people out there that have no connectivity. And so we are able to speed that through our partnerships with MediaTek and Spreadtrum and even Hisilicon that often make models that will go to India, the Middle East, Africa and some of the other emerging markets. So we look good there. The recent numbers in China have been strong. We are also seeing, I think some of these came through some of our peer group\u2019s calls as well. We are seeing a move more towards five modes from three modes, so that increases our content. The recent carrier data shows some better pickup in 4G, LTE. That\u2019s good. So for the most part, China has been actually really an improving story here in the last few months.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question, it comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.", "Kulin Patel", "Hi, it\u2019s Kulin Patel for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. On China, we also heard from others talk about strength in China recently, are you concerned about overbuilding there, given the strength in China?", "Liam Griffin", "No, we are not concerned about overbuilding. We have \u2013 one of the larger accounts we have in China now we have moved to a hub arrangement, which is again part of the inventory issue. But it\u2019s fully lined up, you can\u2019t overbuild in that environment, so you basically just meet your customers\u2019 hub needs. They pull the open market, broad customers in China. We work very closely with MediaTek and some of the other baseband partners to get a broad forecast. Some of the solutions that we sell into that ecosystem are fungible. So they can be sold to multiple customers. That will net out the puts and takes of kind of broader market within China. But no, we feel very, very solid about the inventory dynamics and revenue dynamics with respect to China. We have been in that market for a long time. We were a 2G player, a 3G player. And now actually with 4G and our ability to expand reach, the market for us now is probably the best it\u2019s ever been.", "Kulin Patel", "Thanks. And a quick follow-up, earlier in the year you talked about divesting Trans-Tech I think with a ceramic filter company and I think in your last 10-Q, it looks like you are no longer divesting this asset, can you talk about what would maybe changed your mind on that?", "Don Palette", "To answer your question specifically, they continue to be part of a business. We haven\u2019t gone ahead with that sale. And it\u2019s just the business that at this point, we are comfortable keeping. And we think that there is some growth opportunity going forward associated with it.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question, it comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Yes, thank you. Just going back to the inventory build, do you think this will be kind of a one quarter issue or is it something that it takes kind of into the December quarter to work down. And then any kind of sense of just for the gross margin impact that you are seeing as you have to throttle back a bit?", "Don Palette", "Yes. As far as where we think it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s going to be flat to slightly down going into this quarter. But remember, that\u2019s also supporting higher revenue growth going forward, so some of that is the impact of the revenue growth. The turns are going to begin to move back to historical levels. So as far as the velocity of the inventory, you are going to see us get back there very, very quickly.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it. And then just going back from a dollar content perspective as you look into the fall and upcoming launches, just a general sense as to how you feel about the growth in dollar content?", "Liam Griffin", "No, we feel very positive about the growth in dollar content. And I know I have said it a couple of times already in the call, it\u2019s really twofold. It\u2019s continuing to do well in our core business and our core opportunities in mobile, but also getting a larger region to some of these other opportunities within a handset. And you will see that going out by leading customers.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. The next question is from the line of Harsh Kumar of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.", "Harsh Kumar", "Hi, Liam. First of all, congratulations on your new position. One of the questions we get a lot from investors is about your bar strategy or lack of it, how many of the upper end slots and filters can TC SAW address and eventually what would you guys have to do to be able to get to that upper level of filters?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, thanks Harsh. Well, as I outlined earlier, we can address the upper level of filters today. We just we do it with foundry partners, for example. We would love to be able to build it in-house and that\u2019s something that\u2019s not out of our reach. It just isn\u2019t there today. Our TC SAW capability has moved up in frequency where it was largely just a low band play, maybe 600 meg and 900 meg. We now have technology well over 1 gig, getting close to 2 gig and 2.5 gig. And again, back to what I was mentioning before, we don\u2019t have an appetite for selling discrete filters. So, when we sell a filter, it is wrapped within a complete system. So, the filter contributes some level of performance. But you also have your HBT, your switch, your MCM and your ability to minimize losses within your layout. So, a lot \u2013 and that \u2013 with Skyworks, virtually all of that I mentioned is controlled in-house. So, think about us as a system solutions player. Filters play a role in that system. But the entirety of the architecture is what matters. So, we have won programs with Huawei. We are close with some other customers. There maybe a few opportunities where optimal filter performance is the number one requirement. That maybe the case for some of the discrete applications or maybe some super high performance, high-band sockets. Today, perhaps we can\u2019t address that. But we have the engineering talent, the filter assets and the people and the processes in place to continue to push that envelope and grow them.", "Harsh Kumar", "Great. And for my follow-up, Liam, what is the \u2013 what are the one or two major focus areas for you in the first 12 months of your CEOhood?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, yes, sure, thanks. Well, number one, we definitely want to continue this push by leveraging our core in mobile and taking advantage of this expanding opportunity that we mentioned, receive side technology, WiFi technology, GPS, power management and others and try to create the same systems level approach in that section that has worked so well for us in SkyOne and in transmit. That\u2019s one. The second is stepping up in IoT. I mean, this is the market we talked about for the last few years. We talked about broad market. But within that, the IoT landscape and the class of customers that we engage with today is phenomenal. And we have a unique opportunity, because most of the players in IoT feature one or two connectivity topologies. We have WiFi. We have Bluetooth. We have ZigBee. We have low-power technology. We have power management. And we have tremendous know-how on how to make connected things work and make them work wirelessly. So, we are excited about that. We are going to put more resources around that part of our business. Some other opportunities that have really come along nicely, albeit still quite small, are markets like automotive. We are being pulled into some of the premier players that we mentioned in the opening remarks bringing in full LTE modules and automotive very high performance, high-reliability modules that\u2019s looking good. So we are going to fire on all of those cylinders and then from there continue to drive with the best people and the best execution in our space.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Please go ahead.", "Craig Ellis", "Thanks for taking the question. I will start with a question for Don. Don, if I approach the gross margin issue in a different way. As you look at getting from where you are back to those 58% incremental gross margins and prioritizing the improvement drivers that can close that gap, what\u2019s on the list? It sounds like getting inventory down is one item. I think I heard you mentioned that filter in-sourcing is another, but what else is on the list? And how quickly did those different factors come into play and really provide tailwinds for the margin structure of the business?", "Don Palette", "Yes, they come in very, very quickly. Part of it when we talked about the inventory issue and the level loading that\u2019s been going on, I mean even though the hybrid model serves us really well, we were able to pull in a down quarter as we are able to pull production capacity and externally. You are still not, during this period, we weren\u2019t running completely full. So, that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s very quickly going to get us back up into the incremental margin track. And that\u2019s a big driver of this. And then the other thing is the new product launches as we move forward. We have said we are very focused on every new generation of products going to provide incremental margins. So, that will all be in the mix as we move forward. We are excited about some of the IoT opportunity, as Liam talked about. So, those are the things, Craig, that \u2013 and we have a lot of confidence in the visibility to get down the road to the 53% target. That\u2019s still in front of us, for sure.", "Craig Ellis", "Okay. And then the follow-up is for Liam. Liam, Skyworks I think has been well-known for an above industry average grower. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s playing out that way this year, but we understand the challenges that exist with the large customer. The question is, how patient will you be with the business in getting back to above industry average growth organically? And at what point, will you feel like you have to press for M&A to diversify the business and get back to some of the growth rates and relative growth rates that we are used to seeing from the company?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, Craig. That\u2019s a great question. Well, first of all, I am committed and have great confidence that the organic business, the organic franchise will be an outperformer in terms of growth. Now, we are a bigger company than we were a couple of years ago. There is some level of maturity in unit growth and mobile, which has been the biggest market for us, but we are able to augment that with the share moves that we have talked about. And think again about the usage case that the entities that use mobile technology and what they want and it\u2019s daunting. So, I think it will be solid in core mobile. And I am very comfortable with the opportunity with TAM given some of the new architectures and roadmaps that we have visibility into. Broad market needs to become much more of an IoT play for us. I think that\u2019s really what broad markets means now. And we have great solutions for it. I think we need to put more people behind it, more engineering and help folks behind that. That should work. Now, in parallel, M&A is absolutely an opportunity for Skyworks. We have a tremendous balance sheet. We generated a ton of cash. And I think we will be able to do the right deal when it comes about. But having said all of that, day to day, we are running the franchise, optimizing the franchise, doing everything we can to continue to put the growth up, the margins up, and satisfy our customers. M&A is another area that we will continue to pursue.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Mike Burton of Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "Mike Burton", "Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me in. So, obviously we are a little early to be talking about the December quarter. But given your visibility into product ramps and kind of inventory levels, how do you think we should be thinking about the December quarter relative to kind of normal seasonality? I think it\u2019s been bouncing around quite a bit, but kind of in the mid-single digits historically?", "Don Palette", "Yes, Mike. I think at this point, again we can provide some color on it. We are not in the guiding the numbers, but I think if you look at sort of the historical growth opportunity of high single-digits. That\u2019s a number that I think is reasonable for your modeling right now when you think about that opportunity.", "Mike Burton", "Great. Thanks. And then Don also your thoughts on OpEx going forward, anything relative to BAW development or anything else that we should think about as we frame out our models? Thanks.", "Don Palette", "No, I mean, the BAW OpEx, the engineers that we have and the joint venture or the operations in Japan are already in the run rates. And then the investments we make will continue to be the headcount, which is primarily going to be engineering focused. That\u2019s tended to be where we have done it. And I would go ahead and model after the December quarter, if you are adding about 2 million a quarter from that level I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption as we move forward. You can see during these last three quarters that with the backdrop we have been dealing with, we have done a good job of managing that number fairly flat during that timeframe. But going forward, we will be making investments and that will be primarily headcount.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Hi, guys. Just on the filter capacity, how much capacity are you adding this year, and is the TDK completely in-sourced now?", "Don Palette", "Could you repeat that?", "Vijay Rakesh", "In terms of filter capacity, how much capacity are you adding this year? And I know you are sourcing some filters from TDK, is that completely insourced now?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, I mean the filter capacity right now we are in pretty good shape. There is a possibility as we try to move into certain specialty filters and perhaps move up in frequency. There could be additional CapEx. But we have \u2013 we made a very robust move in capital, expanding our line that we talked about. We now have about 3x the capacity that we had a couple of years ago. Again, with a number of platforms and customers lined up to consume that. So, that\u2019s where we are in filters. And yes, we do continue to buy standard devices, standard filters from third-parties, TDK one of those and that\u2019s potentially something that could change over time, but right now that they are a supplier for some of our filters, that\u2019s correct.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Got it. And on the BAW side, you guys have talked about building out your own BAW filters, you have licensed it, where are you in that roadmap? Thanks.", "Liam Griffin", "Yes. I mean, we are still looking into that as what is the right path to continue on that pace. And we absolutely plan to play in high-band. We are playing in it now. I talked about the Huawei platform and there are a few others. So, that\u2019s something we will give you a little bit more color on perhaps in the next call, but it\u2019s an area that we absolutely understand what\u2019s needed to win. We are winning today with our current strategy and we will look at enhancing our strategy as we go forward.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Quinn Bolton", "Thanks for taking my questions. Liam, just wanted to ask as you look back over the last year given some of the inventory problems, especially with large customers, to the extent, you had more of your products flowing through consignment hubs? Do you think that would have limited some of the volatility you had seen in the business? And if so, is there a push to try and bring more customers into consignment hubs going forward? And then I have got a follow-up for Don.", "Liam Griffin", "Yes. Quinn, well hindsight, you never know how it would look, right. So consignment hubs, some of our customers demand it. And we work with them on it and its fine. Others, they don\u2019t operate with that model and it works out fine, too. I think we have unique situation here in the early part of the year. I think all of us in tech, at least in mobile ecosystem in our peer group felt the wrinkles on that. We have learned from it to some degree. But I don\u2019t know if that would have been mitigated or altered with a different supply chain model. Ultimately, the products that we build go into end products that get sold through the channels. So I think that ultimately that\u2019s all going to level out at some point, so we are not too concerned about it. Again we have one of our larger customers now in Asia that is requiring a hub arrangement with us. So we have work through that and that was actually part of our inventory here that Don mentioned.", "Don Palette", "One-time build there, yes.", "Liam Griffin", "But there isn\u2019t anything significant around being in or out of the hub consignment play.", "Quinn Bolton", "Got it. Okay. And then for Don now with the higher dividend and new share repurchase is 40% of free cash flow to shareholders still a good target, are you thinking of moving that up to a higher level?", "Don Palette", "We have been running a little higher than that. I think you use 50%, that\u2019s kind of a good \u2013 that\u2019s just as we are trying to model, I think that\u2019s fair.", "Quinn Bolton", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And our final questions come from the line of Chris Caso of CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Chris Caso", "Yes. Thank you. Just some clarification from some of the earlier comments, particularly with regard to utilization plans in the second half of the year, as the inventory comes down, are you expecting the utilization levels in the facilities to remain constant and I guess according to the answer to that question, what impact on gross margins\u2026?", "Don Palette", "No, as we go forward, we actually we would expect them to go up slightly. We have kept those factories fairly full with the hybrid. But if anything, as you look into the earnings growth we go forward, we expect that to come up little bit. So that\u2019s a positive impact to the margins as we move forward obviously, whenever we can maximize the internal capacity.", "Chris Caso", "Great, that\u2019s clear. Thanks. And just the follow-up with the comments on China, you understand it sounds like you feel comfortable with what you are shipping against demand levels in China right now, just to be clear, are you expecting growth from your China customers in the second half versus the first half?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes. Chris, we are. We are expecting. And I think what we are seeing saying is kind of a nice bundle of higher performing players that are adopting some of that real rich content that we spoke about. That\u2019s one area. And then the second area and kind of the value tier, we are seeing a nice move here in customers that become exporters into emerging market, so it\u2019s twofold. Performance is going up in China. We are starting to see some real richness, Huawei\u2019s one example. There is few others, Xiaomi is one. And then we are also seeing this great emerging market play that allows us to MediaTek and Spreadtrum and others to participate in an opportunity to connect that 3 billion unconnected. So it\u2019s twofold, and second half will be stronger in China.", "Chris Caso", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Liam Griffin", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for closing comments.", "Liam Griffin", "Thank you, operator and thank you all for participating on today\u2019s call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and events. Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

This call is being recorded.", "At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.", "Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Skyworks Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Year End 2016 Conference Call. On the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward looking. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.", "Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss today are from non-GAAP financials, consistent with the format we have used in the past. Please refer to our press release in the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team discovered solid Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, demonstrating the resiliency and power of our business model. To put a few metrics in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $3.3 billion, expanded gross margin by 280 basis points, delivered 37.8% operating margin, generated record operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, allowing us to return $727 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, more than double the amount from last year. And despite headwinds with one of our leading customers, we are pleased with our ability to deliver record results in fiscal year 2016.", "Now, at a high level, we see strengthening dynamics in the core markets we serve. Specifically, we are in the midst of a massive sea change in the mobile usage case. Given the utility and value that connected devices are bringing to the world, we are supporting and, in many ways, enabling a mobile ecosystem that is cannibalizing traditional brick-and-mortar industries, transforming the way we live, work and play. Wireless platforms have become virtual hubs for e-commerce, enterprise to cloud, social media, gaming and entertainment portals.", "Ultimately, these devices are a conduit for a new multi-trillion connected economy across a wealth of innovative technology players. Consider that the top five S&P 500 companies, namely, Apple, Google Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon, are all monetizing these themes with mobile-centric business models.", "At the same time, smartphone architectures are evolving to accommodate this rapid increase in mobile data across a densely crowded spectrum. The usage case is a catalyst for higher speed, lower-latency, secure and always-on connectivity, which is challenging the capabilities of existing hardware and the supporting cellular infrastructure.", "Our mission at Skyworks is resolving this daunting complexity with customized, custom-level solutions, unburdening our customers while improving the user experience with higher levels of efficiency, enhanced streaming capabilities and expanded network coverage. All of this translates into an expanding opportunity for Skyworks. Recall that our focus is on the wireless connection, the most critical function linking the user to this incredible ecosystem.", "In addition to the rise of mobile data, we are actively addressing two parallel growth drivers. First, connecting the unconnected. There remain 2 billion people that have yet to benefit from this dynamic ecosystem, and Skyworks will play a leading role in bringing this population online. In addition, we are committed to connecting every thing, as we address an estimated 20 billion new devices brought to market over the next five years.", "Skyworks is seamlessly enabling these massive opportunities with highly customized system solutions supporting a broad set of protocols, including cellular LTE, to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and emerging 5G standards. In an effort to facilitate the explosive growth of data delivery, creation, movement and storage, our customers are implementing methods to improve performance with carrier aggregation, receive diversity and MIMO functionality.", "This dynamic involves a step function increase in levels of requisite analog and mixed signal performance, enhanced power efficiency and high precision filtering, as well as configurable systems integration capabilities. Skyworks' broad portfolio in systems-level expertise are well aligned to resolve the intense performance demands facing our customers. And further, 5G will be yet another industry catalyst and significant content driver for Skyworks. This technology will drive band proliferation at higher frequencies and play squarely into our ability to address complexity with fully integrated systems.", "The breadth of our portfolio and our unique market reach continues to fuel a robust and diverse design win pipeline. To illustrate, during the most recent quarter, we leveraged our leadership SkyOne architecture across scores of 4G LTE platforms, with customers like Huawei across their Honor 8 premium lineup. We are also powering the first Google-branded LTE Pixel smartphone. And we are capturing design wins across broader markets in the Internet of Things. In particular, we continue gaining traction with customers like Amazon, supporting their Echo and Tap digital assistants. We are also enabling NETGEAR's Orbi home router system and providing an integrated solution to Trilliant for use in their smart grid platforms.", "In addition, we are deploying small-cell solutions for several leading infrastructure providers in China. And in automotive, we are delivering 4G LTE solutions for use in both Land Rover and Jaguar models. These wins and others demonstrate our expanding customer and end market reach across both mobile platforms and the IoT.", "At this point, I will turn the call over to Kris for his financial review.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter was $835.4 million, up 11% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus. Gross profit was $425.9 million or 51% of revenue, in line with our guidance and up 100 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. Operating expenses were $107.5 million, consistent with our guidance for flat sequential spending. We generated $318.4 million of operating income, translating into 38.1% operating margin. Our cash tax rate was 12.6%, driving net income of $277.6 million dollar or $1.47 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.04.", "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was a record $455 million, driven by high profitability and significant improvements in working capital on a sequential basis. In particular, DSOs declined from 69 days to 45 days and days of inventory declined from 108 days to 94 days, and we expect further reduction of inventory dollars and inventory days in Q1.", "Capital expenditures were $16 million versus $57 million in Q3, reflecting the lower investment level now required for our TC-SAW filter production. Further, in Q4, we repurchased 3 million shares at an average price of roughly $66 a share. And for fiscal 2016, we've repurchased 8 million shares at an average price of just under $66 per share, helping us to reduce our share count from 195 million shares entering the fiscal year to 189 million shares exiting Q4. We also distributed over $200 million in dividends over the course of fiscal 2016, up 63% year over year. In summary, Skyworks returned 81% of our free cash flow, or $727 million, to our shareholders over the fiscal year, up from the 64% distributed in fiscal 2015.", "Now moving on to our outlook. For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially. At the mid-point of $902 million, we expect gross margin in the low 51% range. We expect operating expenses to be $112 million, further reducing our overall OpEx ratio to 12.4% of revenue. Below the line, we anticipate around $1 million in interest and other expenses and a cash tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our share count to be roughly 187 million shares. With our revenue growth and continued operating leverage, we plan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 in the first fiscal quarter.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Kris. So to quickly summarize, we delivered above-guidance results in the fourth fiscal quarter, closing out another record year driven by increasing global demand for high-speed connectivity coupled with strong operational execution. Skyworks systems-level expertise and scale advantages are positioning us to capitalize on the rapidly expanding mobile and IoT ecosystems, particularly with 5G on the horizon. Our profitability and strong cash generation capabilities allow us to fund growth and deliver increasingly higher returns to our shareholders. Clearly, we remain well-positioned to realize our vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open our lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for taking my question. Liam, for my first one, your December sales outlook is above Street expectations. When I look at it, though, it is still somewhat down year-on-year. When do you think you will get back to what has been the historic high-single, double-digit growth rate from a top-line perspective? And as part of that, how's the visibility into content gains and to flagship phones for next year?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Thank you, Vivek. Well, as you outlined, the guidance here for the current quarter is up strong, 7% to 9% coming off an 11% sequential here in Q4. So we certainly see the momentum coming back into our business. With respect to year-over-year comps, we're confident that we will be up on a year-over-year basis in Q2, fiscal Q2. We continue to see great momentum with the flagship players, not just the leading U.S. player, but globally. We're starting to see strength there and that's being represented in our numbers.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And as my follow-up, maybe one for Kris. On gross margins, if you could address the impact on gross margins from both fab utilization and just the market pricing. Because I think you had mentioned you would take down inventory over the next one or two quarters. What is the impact on utilization and gross margins? And part B of that is your competitor just reported very weak gross margins. And I'm wondering if that's a company-specific for them or are you seeing any pricing issues from a market perspective? Thank you.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, I can't speak to what happens to our competitor. And we haven't seen any major changes to the pricing environment. That has been very consistent over the last couple of quarters. And looking forward, we don't see any major changes there.", "Let me just on the gross margin highlight that, in fiscal 2016, we improved the gross margins with 280 basis points exiting the year at 51%, which clearly demonstrates a strong operational execution in terms of margin improvement. And we definitely want to continue to further drive operational efficiencies. And we believe that we can improve the gross margins with another 100 basis points exiting the fiscal year of 2017.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Go ahead, please.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice results.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just curious to follow up on a prior question. When you're looking at the year-over-year and being down, are you still working through that specific customer issue? And when do you think you'll resolve that and be able to back ship the total run units (14:47)?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, Blayne. In our $902 million, we don't have the full complement of what would be the legacy products with one of our customers. So some of that had been invoiced earlier in the year, as we articulated. But I will tell you that by the time this quarter is exited, we're clean, we're back on track. Again, we're pleased with the ability to bring up a 7% to 9% top line off of an 11%. We feel really good about our content position with the leading platforms. But there's a slight \u2013 an abating headwind, but a bit of a touch of that in the $902 million versus the prior year.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. Then maybe just a bigger picture question as you look out next year. You mentioned several drivers. Just curious when you look at carrier aggregation, obviously you are combining bands. And some of those bands may historically be a broadband. Just curious of your view in terms of whether SAW and TC-SAW can address a lot of the transmit in terms of carrier aggregation. And when you look at next year, where do you see your biggest gains? You're able to get and receive game content in the larger phones. Where else do you see picking up decent content next year?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "That's a great question. So as you articulated, there's a couple of dynamics. We've been known for leadership in the transmit chain with Power Amplifier and Power Amplifier plus Duplex or SkyOne-like systems. That continues to be beneficial for us. We're probably 30% to 40% of the way of penetrating the market now. New names like Huawei are adopting the technology, players like Oppo and Vivo in China, and certainly the larger Tier 1s have been with us for a while.", "So in the transmit chain, we continue to move up in frequency. So we've done a great job in low band. We're starting to win mid band. We can address high band with foundry partners for BAW. So that part of the food chain looks really good.", "When you look at the receive side, we have a very unique strategy, a leadership strategy. We've been able to implement high content, high-performance solutions with the leading players in the market. That again now is starting to round out into China and some other spaces where that value is quite unique, and the performance requirements on the downlink side are immense. So we can handle that.", "As you move further along, though, you start to look at 5G, et cetera. We think that the way that transmission will occur with TDD as well as FDD, where you have time-division duplexing, our ability to leverage TC-SAW looks very good there. So we can encroach frequencies that had been the domain of bulk acoustic wave with our TC-SAW with performance advantage and also taking advantage of the unique protocols that we see in 5G.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Go ahead, please.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey. Yeah, thanks, guys, for taking my questions. This is Richard (17:31) in for Harsh. And congratulations on the quarter.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Unknown Speaker", "Just wanted to start off and look a little bit deeper into the December quarter guidance, up 7% to 9%. What are some of the base assumptions for broad-based growth versus growth in mobile? What are you seeing at your largest customer? And then also, within China, some of the buy-siders that we talked to have talked about double ordering taking place over there. Are you seeing anything like that?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Well, let me start with Q1 and then we can touch on China. So we are seeing Q1 seasonally being strong in mobile across all of our major accounts in mobile looking good. And with a great enrichment and content really steering the ship there. So we see that the IoT and broad markets business continues to look good. We're up substantially on a year-over-year basis. IoT was up into the high teens on overall broad markets. For the full fiscal year, we're up about 12%. So we continue to see opportunities there.", "And then if you think about China, we have \u2013 fortunately, China has changed a bit in the last couple of years. It's moved away from this 10 to 12 white-box players where there's a great deal of distribution and just hoping for the best in terms of upgrade cycles and ensuring that you've picked the right horses. What's happening now is it's starting to coalesce around three or four or maybe five players with names like Huawei leading, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and then you get into a long tail of others. So we play that directly with the top four or five, with direct engineer-to-engineer engagements. We also play the entire China theater with our base band partners, so close collaboration with MediaTek, Spreadtrum, HiSilicon, even Qualcomm provides a buffer of diversification.", "So right now, China has been a solid market. We handicap it quite well. We analyze the data from our distributors, we look at the pull rates and the upgrade data that we get from China Mobile and others, and we feel we have a very balanced outlook. I don't expect any volatility through any double ordering or anything like that. I don't see that. But we'll maintain a cautious view as we look out.", "Unknown Speaker", "That's extremely helpful. And then wanted to get your sense on what you look for, what are your criteria for M&A? And what's the appetite for M&A right now?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Sure. Well, the good news for us is that we're very bullish on the opportunities in front of us today at Skyworks. There's a great deal for us to do in our core markets in mobile and IoT and expanding our broad portfolio. We like what we see there. There's a tremendous need to support great customers looking forward. So M&A isn't something that is mission critical for Skyworks.", "But having said that, we continue to look at opportunities if they come about. Our track record, as you know, reflects that we are highly disciplined when it comes to M&A. A deal needs to meet all of our stringent criteria. You can see that we've done a few deals in the last few years. The Panasonic JV has closed, bringing great TC-SAW technology in-house. We did a SiGe deal a few years ago for Wi-Fi technology that's played out beautifully. And even a power management deal with Advanced Analogic. And all of those elements play very well into our long-term strategy. So we'll keep our lens open for opportunities as they come about. But, again, very stringent financial criteria here.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on turning the corner in sequential growth in your on-hand inventory. Liam, I wanted to start with a longer-term question on the growth of the business. So one of the supply chain players early in the reporting season noted they think that smartphones will grow about 5% through 2020. I'm not asking you to endorse that. But if that were the industry's growth rate, what growth rate would you be satisfied with organically? And do you feel like you've got enough leverage in the portfolio to drive sufficient organic growth, or do you need to have a blended organic and inorganic strategy?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Well, I think organically, Craig, if you look at the unit growth which is approximately, as you indicated, about 5% on smartphones. It's the content lever that we're most excited about. And if you listen to the prepared remarks, one of the reasons why we talk about this mobile ecosystem and some of these great companies that are monetizing it, is that they really are driving change. They're driving change with our customers and our customers are driving that change to us. And often it's a give and take. In many cases, we're at the drawing board in crafting these incredible systems that move data.", "So we see content being really the key focus. So we see unit growth could be 3% to 5% growth, maybe as high as 7% in top-line units. But it's the content lever that is unique. And I think that is where \u2013 I know that is where Skyworks outperforms. The higher the content in terms of the complexity and the performance needs, that's when we do our best work. So with that said, we would expect to be at or around double-digits across the board. Could be higher in some cases, depending on the market and the mix.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "That's helpful. And then one for Kris. Kris, you mentioned that you'd expect gross margins to be up 100 basis points. That's solid, but it is just 40% of what the business had done in the just completed year. So as we look at the performance of the business, should we expect that as the expanded manufacturing facility, both with Panasonic and Impact Gene (23:03), as that really ramps and hits its operational stride, that longer term we can get back to years where gross margins can improve on a multi-hundred basis point basis, or is this the new run rate for the business?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, there are definitely multiple levers to improve gross margins. As Liam just explained, we see some above-market revenue growth. And, of course, incremental revenue and volume growth help to absorb our fixed cost structure.", "Secondly, we are insourcing the filters in our own filter fab, and that is driving further margin expansion. And then, of course, there is the normal tackle and blocking and operational efficiency improvements, including cycle-time reduction, yield improvements and internal and external cost reductions. And maybe last but not least as well, we do see a further mix improvement in some other areas outside of mobile that have slightly above-average gross margin. And when you put it all together, we are comfortable that we can further improve our gross margins.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Atif Malik with Citigroup. Go ahead, please.", "Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the execution. Liam, the first question, you talked about the criteria for M&A. And I think in the past, Skyworks has talked about maybe acquiring something in the $2 billion to $3 billion range kind of size of the company. Can you just remind us what are some of the criteria you're looking at? And is this still the right size of the deal you're looking at?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, I wouldn't really want to put any boundaries on deal size. I think it's more about the merit of the opportunity and how it plays within a Skyworks franchise, so to speak. So we definitely look for opportunities that \u2013 everyone talks about synergies in terms of accretion and financials. But I also want to see entities that really do better with the Skyworks brand than they would separately.", "We talked about some success stories. SiGe, Panasonic, even AATI, are example of that. So we would like to have the kind of acquisitions that really raise the overall franchise, that bring us into new technology opportunities that perhaps augment our strength already in the positions in the market that we enjoy today.", "So it's a complex answer. There isn't one simple thing that we're looking for. It's a number of things.", "We do have a very, very high bar. We've looked at a lot of franchises and a lot of assets. And for us, the bars are quite high. And I like that. I think we've worked really hard to generate the cash that now has been phenomenal for us and I think we're on a great track record to continue to do that. We have the powder to do the right deals when they come along, but we'll continue to be very vigilant.", "Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Sure. And then as a follow-up, you guys had a pretty good design win in the latest iPhone and diversity receive modules. And Murata was quoted in an EK (26:13) article in Japan that they could take pricing down by like one-third to get the sockets back. Can you just talk about the stickiness of these wins? And how should we think about you guys extending this content going to next year?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Yeah. All of these complex solutions that you eluded to, whether they're with the lead customer or the top three or four, are highly customized. I know what we offer. It's highly customized. It is very sticky. These are engineer-to-engineer developed solutions, highly calibrated within the customer's ecosystem. There's little risk that anyone will be unseated or there will be any kind of pricing action post design-win.", "And then it's the incumbency and the ability to execute, the ability to manage your capacities and execute the supply and all those other things that keep you in it the long term. So we feel really good about our position with the leading accounts and our ability to grow with highly complex solutions that in every new cycle, upgraded, altered, changed to meet customers' needs.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC", "Yeah, thank you. The first question is regarding the inventory levels. Could you take a bit about where you expect those to be exiting the quarter? I'd suppose you'd want to have the inventory levels down entering the seasonally slower March quarter. Just talk a little bit about that, about the magnitude of any potential reduction and where you'd like to see them exiting the year.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, so during Q4 we reduced our days of inventory from 108 days to 94 days. That's a 13% reduction. We are pleased with that. We do expect in Q1 to further reduce inventory, both as an absolute dollar level as well as in terms of days of inventory where we target to get to approximately 85 days.", "Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay. That's 85 days by the end of the year? Or is that a target for the future?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "There will be some seasonal fluctuations as you go through the normal seasonality, but on average that's what we target.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead, please.", "Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. This is Kulin Patel calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. For your revenue headwind, you mentioned headwind at your largest customer. Is all the headwind due to legacy units, or was there any share loss?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "No. No share loss. This is really just about some headwinds on legacy units that were shipped earlier in the year, trued up now here by the middle of the end of this quarter.", "Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. And for the CapEx, you mentioned it's down because of lower investments in TC-SAW. How do we think about it for the new fiscal year? What's your CapEx plans for the year? Are there any investments in the pipeline?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "No, just normal course. In fiscal 2016, we spent roughly $189 million. For fiscal 2017, we target $200 million to $220 million of CapEx.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, let me just add, if you go back to a couple years back we were at about $400 million to $430 million to really outfit and install the significant TC-SAW facility, which is a $3 billion unit per year producer of high-performance filters. So that's a big bump up. With that behind us, the run rate CapEx that Kris mentioned is sustainable. It's enough for us. We can do a great job with that capital and monetize our assets and filters as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. My first question is whether you can segment revenue out by PA, IMS and broad markets?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yes, so broad market was approximately 25%, mobile approximately 60%, and PA 15% during the fourth quarter of 2016.", "Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you for that. And then I guess I had a question about the revenue minus your largest customer. You had guided it up in the range of 10% to 12% for the September quarter. Can you give us what that actually came in at? And what the guidance implies if I exclude your largest customer?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, so in terms of the full year, I can give you the full year of 2016, the balance of our business ex our largest customer was up about 11% to 12%. And it's a portfolio of broad market, other mobile absent the largest customer and other IOT businesses. So that's kind of the roughest cut at the high level. In Q1, our largest customer is seasonally strong, of course, going into a seasonal ramp. But the top-three Tier 1 accounts are also ramping aggressively into Q1.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes, thanks. Question on the gross margin outlook for the December quarter. Typically, you'd see some fall through in terms of the higher volumes. I know you mentioned you're working inventory. Maybe that's an influence. Anything else potentially from a mix perspective in terms of some of the new wins, what they might carry versus a year ago?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "No. From a mix point of view, Q1 traditionally has a higher mobile revenue, which is slightly below average. And so that has an impact on the gross margin.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, there's a number of questions asked on M&A and capital allocation. The diversification angle specifically, how important is that to the company as you explore potential deals out there?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Well, diversification is an element. It's something that we look for. But really, it isn't the only criteria. It's not the underlying criteria. We're looking for opportunities that really drive the entirety of the business. And as we said, we feel really good about what mobile is bringing. It's a lot more than what the market expected three or four years ago or five years ago. And what we are seeing from our customers is just a daunting and relentless push for performance.", "And what we're also enjoying are product developments and revenue streams that weren't on the radar screen five years ago, diversity receive, we talked about, Wi-Fi has been taking off. Our GPS location systems are taking off. We are seeing more and more reach into our filter franchise. There's just a lot to do. So we wouldn't look at a deal on the merit of diversification as a primary motive. It would be nice in some cases, but we would also entertain opportunities that really help us advance our core business.", "Operator", "Thank you. We now have a question from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Go ahead, please.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Yeah, hi, guys. I'm just looking at the gross margins for the December quarter. Last year when your top line (33:23) was up 5%, your margins improved pretty nicely, 100 bps, 140 bps. Here you're guiding flat. Are the incremental gross margins much lower than what you've had historically?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Our incremental gross margins are in the mid-50%s right now.", "Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Sure. And as you look at the BAW roadmap, I know you guys said you are getting BAW from your foundry partners. Can you update us on how your roadmap looks there? Are you expecting any BAW products launching here, or still expect TC-SAW to take that part of the bands, too? Thanks.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Well, there are significant growth opportunities in the areas that we are strong today across TC-SAW. We continue to push the frequency range in TC-SAW quite nicely. We're winning a lot of products there, not only on transmit, but also on diversity receive. So BAW technology is not critical. It's not mission critical. We understand where it is in roadmaps, where it isn't in road maps. We are making great progress again in raising the market opportunity for our TC solutions.", "And also when you look at things like 5G, what we're seeing is that there's more and more TDD capability in 5G than FDD. So when you go to TDD, time division duplexing, you don't require a BAW filter or a BAW duplexer. You can do it with TC in many of these frequencies. So that's another expanding opportunity for us.", "Now having said all that, we have access to BAW. We're using it today with some of our flagship products with foundry partners. We always take a look at make versus buy, is it an opportunity for us to invest in-house. We'll continue to weigh that balance. But be sure that we're going to be able to address the market as we need to. We'll be able to address the filter opportunities and the systems engines that we've been delivering for years. So there's no stop on that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Go ahead, please.", "Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks. This is Vincent Celentano on for Steve. I was wondering if you could tell us during the quarter how many handset customers did you have and if you can you give us an idea of how big the overall Chinese handset OEMs were as a percentage of revenue for the smartphones base?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "So we have two more than 10% customers, Foxconn at about 40% and Samsung at about 10%.", "Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Great.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "With respect to China. So China all-in, I don't have the itemization of the handset versus the broad market. All-in China is about 25% in that. And then if you look at the mobile portion would be led by Huawei, for example. But all-in, 25%.", "Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And the obviously, this past March was more of an abnormality in terms of your normal seasonal trends. So just going forward, as you look in the March quarter, is there any reason you wouldn't see the normal trends you had seen the past few years before this past March?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Correct. I think as we anticipate typical market seasonality for our space is maybe 10% to 15% down in the March quarter. Our mission is to offset that to some degree. We're confident we can do it. Last year was a bit of an aberration. So our job is to out-perform that market in March.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Go ahead, please.", "Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC", "Welcome, Kris. Looks like broad markets went down about 5% if it went from 29% of sales to 25%. So is that just lumpiness or anything happening in Wi-Fi or IoT?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, the issue there was more around infrastructure more than anything else. The IoT space was about flat. That will come up again in about March. And infrastructure was a bit of a drag on broad markets in this quarter.", "Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then maybe talk more about SkyBlue. It looks like you've got some nice power efficiency solutions that go beyond envelope tracking. It sounds like you had Panasonic. Should we expect any progress in some other geographies and other OEMs?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Great question. I'm glad you brought that up. So SkyBlue is a method that Skyworks uses really as another way to provide efficiency in the amplification and transmission food chain. And so we do that with a very unique proprietary architecture we call SkyBlue. It is embedded in some of our systems solutions. If you look at some of the leading platforms that we've announced and you can see through tear-downs, those devices are apparent there.", "They've made up with our SkyOne solutions to provide higher levels of efficiency. Incredible levels. Higher than ET in many cases. It's a device that is base band agnostic. We are working with all the key chip providers as well, and it is very early for us right now. We have a long way to go with this solution. We are continuing to provide new and additional revs with upgraded performance. But it is in production with four or five key brands today.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Go ahead, please.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Thanks, Liam. If iPhone 6s inventory is all consumed by the time you exit December, as you indicated, why shouldn't we expect to see orders for those parts to you from Apple if they keep selling that phone in 2018? Is that an erroneous assumption? But if the phone is still being built after they consumed all their raw material from you, then I would expect you'd see some sort of revenue for that product.", "And then on MediaTek Phase 2/Phase 3, China has been strong for you and your competitors. And I know that Phase 2/Phase 3 only use modules with switches and amplifiers. But it sounds like MediaTek may be moving to pads earlier than expected. You currently do not sell discrete filters into that market. But if they go to pads and you're one of the two big suppliers of those parts already, why should we expect that your filter demand should step up significantly because MediaTek would obviously be buying those filters from whoever is buying the modules, and that's going to be you and maybe Corbo (39:37).", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, great insights, Ed. So on the first one, certainly if there were additional demand requirements for the Legacy products with our lead customer, it would be well positioned to deliver, and that could be incremental revenue for us. So that is one.", "And then with respect to MediaTek, you got it right. So right now we have a very strong partnership with MediaTek. And one of the products that has done really well in that ecosystem is our SkyLiTE product. So the SkyLiTE product, and I know you get this, but for everyone. It is really a SkyOne solution absent the filter. So we lay out all the required amplification, transmit, receive, switching, and we do everything but the filters. And we allow the MediaTek ecosystem, the customers that use the MediaTek chipset, to pick and choose filters. That's been the lay of the land here for a while.", "Next rev we are looking at integrating, leveraging our TC-SAW capability to bring in a complete pad or SkyOne-like product to these MediaTek customers. So it's a great opportunity. We are working on it right now. Hopefully we'll have more to report to you here in the next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Well, thank you all for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences and events during the quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call.

Riley", "Anthony Stoss - Craig Hallum", "Atif Malik - Citigroup", "Vijay Rakesh - Mizuho Securities", "Josh Burkhalter - Oppenheimer", "Bill Peterson - JPMorgan", "Operator", "Good afternoon, and welcome to Skyworks Solutions First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded.", "At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.", "Mitch Haws", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' First Fiscal Quarter 2017 Conference Call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.", "Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss today are non-GAAP financial measures, consistent with our past practices. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.", "Liam Griffin", "Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team delivered exceptional results in the December quarter. Let me begin with a few highlights.", "We achieved revenue of $914 million, up 9.4% sequentially and above our guidance range. We expanded gross margins to 51.2% and operating margins to 38.8%, illustrating strong operational execution and prudent expense management.", "We produced record earnings per share of $1.61, $0.03 better than our guidance and perhaps most importantly, we generated nearly $0.5 billion in cash flow from operations in the quarter, another record for Skyworks.", "In addition to our strong P&L and balance sheet performance, I am especially pleased with our design win execution, particularly at marquee customers. Of note, we secured SkyOne platform wins with multiple Tier 1 Sky OEMs, extended our leadership position in diversity received systems and secured a key win in our custom high band PAD portfolio.", "We ramped fully integrated fully integrated low, mid and high band solutions integrating SkyBlue technology for Huawei's Mate9 platform, their flagship phone. We launched multiple devices across Samsung's entire portfolio and gained momentum in China, with key wins at market leaders Oppo, Vivo, Meizu and Xiaomi.", "All of these wins were captured by resulting the growing complexity and performance requirements inherent in today's advanced mobile architectures. Specifically, we're seeing the continued shift to highly integrated transmit solutions, leveraging our core capabilities in gallium arsenide, temperature compensated SAW filtering and enhanced power management.", "In addition, we are benefiting from the rapid move toward carrier aggregation, a major catalyst in driving higher data rates with expanding bandwidth in both uplink and downlink transmission. In parallel, we continue to expand our opportunity by growing our content reach with new revolutionary diversity receive systems, specifically targeted at the most complex carrier aggregation challenges, as well as a growing suite of analog solutions from Wi-Fi, GPS, antenna tuning, signal conditioning and more.", "Now moving on to our broad markets portfolio and IOT. We expanded our design win pipeline to include wins with Netgear home security system, ARRIS cable modems as well as Comcast and Rogers with carrier-grade broadband gateways.", "In addition, we secured design win supporting the latest voice assistant technology from Amazon, Google and Microsoft. We also capitalized on the newest trend towards home Wi-Fi mesh networking, with key wins at Linksys, Ubiquiti Networks and other leading OEMs.", "And finally, we broadened our footprint across the automotive sector, leveraging the diverse array of wireless protocols supporting connected car applications, vehicle to vehicle communication and 4G telematics.", "In this past quarter, we were pleased to have consummated a strategic design win at a leading U.S. electric car OEM. Our Q1 results, strong outlook and design win momentum reflect solid tracks in spanning out mobile, IOT and broad market portfolio.", "The success we are demonstrating is part of a secular multiyear fee and we are still in the early innings. At a higher level, Skyworks is at the epicenter of a sea change in mobility. Our end markets are driving a substantial move from brick-and-mortar to a rapidly growing mobile economy.", "This trend places an unprecedented burden on analog RF and mix signal performance, vastly increasing the value and utility of our solutions. It's compelling to see how many different avenues mobile technology now supports, whether it's streaming 4K video, social media, mobile payment or rapidly evolving areas such as augmented reality, virtual assistance and the connected car.", "Popular apps including Facebook, Uber, Netflix YouTube, Spotify, and Wave, all share key characteristics. They require ultrafast, low latency highly secure and efficient connectivity, as well as location-based services. These challenging needs are invariably facilitated by an integrated Skyworks engine. Importantly, we uniquely support all the wireless protocols enabling these diverse applications including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPS and LTE.", "Further 5G represents a massive growth opportunity for our industry and certainly for Skyworks. In fact, market projection suggest 5G data rates will approach 10X the speed of card 4G and LTE solutions. To put this in perspective, downloading a full-length HD movie in 3G took one day. In 4G, the same file took minutes. On a 5G network, this content will be downloaded in mere seconds. At the same time, the connected car is yet another catalyst that offers significant opportunity for Skyworks.", "Looking out over the next years, the amount of data that will be delivered to and from the car is estimated to be 5 to 10 times more than the bandwidth used by today's smartphone. For instance, by 2020, a single autonomous car is expected to consume 4,000 gigabits of data per day and real-time diagnostics, positioning, vehicle-to-vehicle communications and that's equivalent to the daily data consumed by more than 2,000 smartphone users in 2017.", "Skyworks is uniquely positioned to capitalize with solutions that solve all of these daunting connectivity challenges, setting the stage for outperformance across cars and new markets.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for review of our financial results and Q2 outlook.", "Kris Sennesael", "Thanks Liam. The revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $914 million. up 9.4% sequentially and exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was $468 million or 51.2% of revenue and operating expenses were $113 million. As a result, we generated $354 million of operating income, translating into 38.8% of operating margin.", "Our tax rate was 14.7%, driving net income of $302 million or $0.01 -- $1.61 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.03.", "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, cash flow from operations was a record $496 million, driven by higher profitability and ongoing improvements in working capital. In particular, DSOs declined from 45 to 37 days, while days of inventory declined from 94 to 86 days.", "Improvements in overall working capital generated over $100 million of cash flow in Q1. Capital expenditures were $50 million about 5% of revenue and in line with our target model. Further in Q1 we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of roughly $76. Finally, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.35 billion from $1.8 billion at the end of Q4.", "Now moving to our outlook for fiscal Q2. For the second quarter of 2017, we anticipate our revenue to be $840 million. up about 8% compared to Q2 of last year. At this revenue level, we expect gross margins to be in the low 50% range with operating expenses of approximately $115 million as we continue to invest in grow initiatives, including our IOT business.", "Below the line, we anticipate roughly $0.5 million in interest and other expense and a tax rate of approximately 15%. We expect our share count to be roughly 186 million shares. Accordingly, we plan to generate earnings per share of $1.40 in the second quarter up 12% year-over-year.", "With that, I will turn the call back over to Liam.", "Liam Griffin", "Thank you, Kris. As our first quarter results and outlook illustrate, we are off to a strong start in fiscal 2017. We delivered solid revenue and earnings, set a record for EPS and quarterly cash flow, while guiding about March quarter consensus estimates. Our profitability and increasingly strong cash generation is allowing us to fund growth and deliver higher returns to our shareholders.", "In fact, the new $500 million share buyback authorization announced today reflects the confidence of both the executive team and our Board with respect to our strategic outlook. Skyworks' systems level expertise, operational scale and deep customer engagement are enabling us to capitalize on the rapidly expanding mobile and IOT ecosystems, while positioning us for 5G leadership.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's set the lines up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions] The first question will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Harsh Kumar", "Yes. Hey, congratulations. Tremendous quarter and guide. Liam, let me ask you. At this time, usually in the year there's a lot of movement and a lot of concern amongst investors about the end markets and the different geos. Would you be able to comment for us on where the inventory stand and what you are able to see in the marketplace at this time?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure Harsh. For us right now, the market backdrop looks quite good and we continue to see an increasing push in mobile for higher complexity, higher performance and that for us as you know translates into opportunity. It's not all with one or two accounts. We're starting to see some great penetration with leaders in China.", "We mentioned Huawei, certainly large players in the U.S., large players in Korea are all exhibiting that. And then in parallel and we talked about this for a while, but it's really coming together nicely that our broad business, our broad market portfolio continues to grow.", "Looking at a year-over-year basis, we're reporting a 10% to 15% year-over-year growth rate with that opportunity and that providers just another boost for us in terms of topline.", "Harsh Kumar", "And Liam as my follow-up, would you be able to tell us what your largest customer was as a percentage of revenues?", "Liam Griffin", "It was slightly above 40%.", "Harsh Kumar", "Thanks guys. Congrats again.", "Liam Griffin", "Thanks, Harsh.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Blayne Curtis", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo the nice results. Liam, maybe just as you talked about your happy with design progress at marquee customers. Maybe as you look at the rest of the year, where do you see the biggest opportunity gain content adding color by product or by customer region would be helpful.", "Liam Griffin", "Sure Blayne. What we're seeing is very good success in keeping pace with our core architecture SkyOne architecture, switching architectures, but we're now augmenting this with new technology and kind of what I call an expanding product reach doing great work in carrier aggregation, both uplink and downlink.", "We have some unique solutions that we really pioneered in the industry around downlink receipt side, addressing CA and the complexities. We're taking that kind of an engine and pushing that forward to names like Huawei and names like Samsung and some of the other China players.", "Our GPS technology is getting adopted now on a quite consistent basis. Wi-Fi has been moving to MIMO architectures in mobile and also in some of the broader markets. So, it's really quiet a mix and what I am really pleased about is our ability, our team's ability to look long at these challenges in mobile and then architect very unique solutions with customer\u2019s hand-in-hand to finally deliver what makes Skyworks special. So, we see that trend continuing.", "Blayne Curtis", "Thanks Liam. I just wanted to ask on the gross margin, I know it's seasonally weak this period, down a 100 basis points. If you can just talk about the puts and takes and then maybe your outlook for margins for the rest of the year.", "Liam Griffin", "Yeah absolutely. So first of all, I'm pleased with our execution in Q1 with gross margin coming in at 51.2%. Looking at Q2 obviously, this is a seasonality softer quarter with revenue down approximately $74 million, $75 million and so that you can see reflecting into the gross margin.", "Having said that, we are feeling -- we're very well positioned for further margin expansion in the second half of 2017 as we expect the next three quarters to see sequential revenue growth going forward.", "Blayne Curtis", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Vivek Arya", "Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on gross margins pressure if I could. When I look at last year, there was a bigger revenue drop from December to March and I believe gross margins declined about 60 basis points. I think this time you're guiding to somewhat higher decline in gross margins.", "Is it just prudent factory management, utilization management, what is giving a bigger hit to gross margin this time versus last year?", "Kris Sennesael", "Yes so, we're talking here a couple basis points right. And so we will see where we come in with the actual of Q2, but it's definitely so that last year there was some inventory build, but now for the last two quarters in a row, we have been working on an inventory reduction program.", "Again, it's all about the same level of gross margins as it's important for us to go and further drive gross margin expansion in the second half of 2017 as we see to strengthen the business and the revenue growth coming in.", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, and let me add to that Vivek. We were very confident that as Kris articulated, as we stepped through the second half fiscal and second half calendar year, you're going to see revenue and margin step up. So, we're committed to continuing that path.", "Vivek Arya", "Got it. And as my follow-up Liam, if you could just give us the breakdown you usually give between the different product lines and integrated mobile broad markets etcetera, but the bigger question is you gave a lot of detail around your IOT and automotive wins.", "When I go back to the 10K you had filed, outside of Apple, your sales grew about 8% last year or so. So, I am just wondering how are your sales doing outside of Apple in December and in March? If you could just give us some color what your design win and progress has been outside of that large customer, whether it's my product or segmented or what have you, thank you?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, our growth and success outside of our largest customers has been outstanding. Huawei became the number two account for us this last quarter. They're going to continue to be one of our leaders. We have our customer in Korea, who will continue to grow significantly into 2017 and our largest customers will set up very well for us as well as we address some very complex architectures with compelling products. So, we feel really good about that on the mobile side.", "And then let me remind you that the broad market portfolio from the infrastructure to IOT to early stages of automotive, all look good and the staff there are double-digit year-over-year.", "Vivek Arya", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of John Vinh with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "John Vinh", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question is can you talk about what your expectations for the RF TAM growth for the industry and the flagship smartphone this year and maybe talk about what your expectations of growth is relative to that TAM? I know historically you've talked about that TAM growing at a 10% to 15% CAGR?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure John. I think part of the driver there as you probably know is just really the upgrade cycle across the Board. So, you have your most developed accounts that will be moving up with higher levels of complexity, bringing in more complex EA architectures, maybe even going MIMO on the radio potentially that's out there.", "And then you have your value tier players that are moving up maybe at a higher rate percentagewise, but haven't quite hit the dollar value of the top tier. So, we address all of that. We're not a player that spends much time with the 2G or 3G market. So, the segments that we address, we think it is a double-digit tam opportunity.", "One of the things that we've been going at Skyworks is we continue to innovate and elevate our portfolio. So, these products today that we're selling and enjoying share gains, that just didn't exist three or four years ago. So, we're continuing to push the envelope. There is also a lot of technology that flows between mobile and IOT. Our very strong portfolio and Wi-Fi, we have a Bluetooth portable. We have a GPS portfolio. None of that is really part of the traditional RF TAM, but it matters.", "Our SkyBlue technology for power management is becoming more and more pivotal for us in design wins. So, it's really a broadening suite. In overall TAM, probably 10% to 12%, but I think we have some unique opportunities to address it in our portfolio.", "John Vinh", "Great. Thank you. And my follow-up question is on 5G. Liam, you seem to be very optimistic about your prospects in 5G. If I look at some of the initial frequencies being discussed in 5G, they tend to be much higher than what we've even seen at 4G. Can you just break down the opportunities for you to benefit from content growth in 5G? And also, maybe can you talk about the role of TC-SAW within 5G given the higher frequencies?", "Liam Griffin", "Yeah absolutely. So 5G is really going to be a game changer for the space. It could present up to 10 times the date rate that we see today in 4G. There are these three big themes when you look at 5G, you try to create a faster data pipe, lower latency, more efficient. It's about increasing bandwidth which is going to drive carrier aggregation of the click, higher modulation schemes that you're going from 256 QAM maybe to 1024 higher density as complexity.", "There is MIMO architectures that will scratch that pipe. All of these themes are very important and if you think about frequency for it John, if you move up to some of these higher frequencies in 5G, they are very often TDD modulation, so time division duplex and TDD requires band pass filtering. It doesn\u2019t require duplex or so. We have a unique opportunity there to stretch our TC socket with only too higher frequencies in a TDD domain and gain additional share.", "John Vinh", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Yes. Thank you. Question on growth this year, as you look through, can you give us some sense in terms of whether it's that leading smartphone OEMs in North America and Korea versus China, kind of where you think your growth will skew in 2017?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, Craig. Yes, the growth should span across our larger customers. It should also span across kind of what I would consider a value Tier portfolio, the Oppo and Vivo and maybe to a lesser extent Meizu and Xiaomi moving up.", "Huawei, we mentioned today is now a clear number two customer for us. They have really stepped up in terms of the content, the richness of content and the reach of technology, providing opportunity for us to deliver mid-band, high-band, low-band solutions, power management, diversity receive, addressed CA uplink and downlink.", "So, we see a great opportunity with the value tier moving up and then the high tier actually increasing their content. Those are the important themes. And then the additional in parallel opportunities in broad markets continue to span and we expect double-digit growth there for the foreseeable future.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it. And then as my follow-up on the buyback announcement, can you put that into the context in terms of as you evaluate internal growth opportunities and also just M&A in the industry?", "Kris Sennesael", "Yes, we are definitely committed to continue to return cash to the shareholder with our dividend program and our share buyback program. We returned $106 million in Q1 repurchasing 1.4 million shares in Q1 and saw -- we have now put in place a new $500 million program. Historically, we have been returning 40%, 50% of our free cash flow to the shareholders and so that's something that we will continue to do so.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Steve Smigie", "Great. Thanks a lot, guys. You guys have been seeing pretty good dollar content gain on flagship phones. I think around order of about 20% and maybe address this a little bit, but I was hoping you could talk a little bit about if you expect to continue to see 20% growth, dollar content growth across flagships.", "But also. I wanted to drill down on the midrange phones where it seems like there is a lot of opportunity. Could you see 20% growth at this point on midrange phones or is it -- should we be looking at a different relative growth?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, sure. Both sides of the equation there are critical for us. Certainly, flagship phones and what we're seeing there is really a great opportunity -- actually we're really happy about it as we talked a lot about this technology and this ecosystem within mobile and that tremendous ecosystem, all these great applications that we enjoy driving change in hardware and it's happening.", "And each year every customer has different cycles, but every success of generation of smartphone technology that we address has had increasing burden, increasing challenge and increasing opportunity for Skyworks. That's what drives the content for us.", "We've also been able to push our reach. We're moving the areas within this technology, new areas to enjoy further gain. So, we feel really good about that trend continuing. Our teams are doing a phenomenal job right now with the most critical customers, with the smartest people on the customer end and in Skyworks to make sure that that happens.", "So, that's going to be big part of the story. But in parallel you hit on the other key point. There's a tremendous volume of mid value tier players producing smartphones today that haven't yet enjoyed that big step up in performance.", "And if you look at Huawei as a case study, we've worked with them for many, many years and had a great relationship and been involving just about every platform and the big swing for us is when finally, the technology and PAD technology in power management ad Wi-Fi and some of these complex system were adopted the revenue accelerated. There's a value tier today that's significant that hasn\u2019t yet made that movement. We're going to work very closely to make that happen with them.", "Steve Smigie", "Okay. Great. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about China overall as a percentage. Huawei has shut up a lot and so I was wondering if you could still quantify say China on its own as a percent as a bucket, and may be with and without Huawei and then if you're willing what Samsung was as a percentage of revenue in the quarter?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. Well, China all in for us is about 25% of revenue and it\u2019s not just mobile. We have a pretty strong infrastructure position in China across Huawei, across ZTE and others. The mobile business is strong and then there is some other broad market portfolios there. So, it\u2019s about 20%, 25% of the revenues there and what was the second part of the question?", "Kris Sennesael", "It was on the Samsung, so Samsung just fell below the 10% level and we all know why that is. But we see a nice bounce back of the Samsung business already starting in Q2 and in the second half of 2017.", "Steve Smigie", "Okay. Thanks, and congrats on the good quarter.", "Liam Griffin", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.", "Ambrish Srivastava", "Hi, thank you. I wanted to focus on the free cash flow, last couple of quarters so now this is two quarters in a row, your free cash flow margin has gone up to 50% and you laid out. thanks for laying out the contribution from the working capital levers that you were able to put. The question is, how should we think about what is the steady-state free cash flow margin profile for the company, because it has jumped up significantly?", "And then second kind of tied to that and I am not sure if you answered the question that was asked earlier how to think about the buyback that you just announced vis-\u00e0-vis your appetite for M&A. Is that the sign that you're more comfortable in the business and returning shareholder value just via that or it's a sign of that plus the fact that you're now generating enough cash that you can make an acquisition as well as follow the step? Thank you.", "Kris Sennesael", "So, I\u2019ll take the first part on free cash flow and I'm really happy with the performance there, especially in Q1. We\u2019ve almost $0.5 billion of cash flow from operations. We have been focusing very strongly on working capital management driving down DSOs, driving down days of inventory and so that has helped a lot in the quarter.", "We're at the level right now that there is not a lot of improvement from that level now and so you won't see a repeat of those further improvements in working capital. But having said that, when you look at our business model, we will continue to generate a ton of cash every quarter going forward.", "Liam Griffin", "With respect to the M&A element there, just to remind everyone, we are very focused on our core franchising connectivity. It's a significant market. There is a great deal of investment going forward there that has turned to be profitable for us and fruitful for us.", "But at the same time, we do evaluate M&A opportunities. We look at a lot of potential transactions. We have a very high bar with our financial consideration on that end. But we keep an open mind. We announced the 500 million shares repurchase program here today and we certainly have the opportunity if the right deal comes about to exercise an M&A transaction.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Please go ahead.", "Quinn Bolton", "Hi, guys, let me add my congratulations. Liam, just wanted to first ask the guidance was better than seasonal trend, what do you attribute that to? Is it sort of dollar content gains on the platforms? Is it the end of the inventory reduction program you mentioned earlier on the call?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes absolutely, it's really about our ability to outperform on design wins that were consummated kind of in the middle of the prior year and now flowing forward. So, we were really excited about that the content reach again is expanding.", "We\u2019re engaging more and more with fully integrated SkyOne Solutions rather than power amplifiers and filter separated. The carrier aggregation products that we put forward and diversity received are quite compelling in the market and then again, the roster of IOT accounts that we\u2019re bringing forward continues to grow and the content within those applications where maybe we had -- we started with a single Wi-Fi device. Now we have 3x3 devices.", "We\u2019re embedding GPS more and more. We got Bluetooth opportunity. So, the whole spectrum is expanded. And as we look at March, we feel very good about our guidance there as Kris indicated. Backlog coverage is solid. We\u2019re fully booked and it\u2019s a very balanced quarter as well.", "Quinn Bolton", "Great and then a follow-up, just you mentioned on the prepared comments a couple of high-band pad wins, a scenario you\u2019ve been underpenetrated. What's your outlook for that business going forward and can you comment whether those are using outsourced pass filters or are you starting to be able to source some of those filters in the high band with TC-SAW internal capacity?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, sure, sure, great question. Well as know, when we go to market, our strategy is to sell a system solution. So, it input to output performance. So, it incorporates our highly customized and curated gallium arsenide technology, unique filtering technology, SOI packaging, testing. The whole engine is really a Skyworks signature and within that engine, we select the best process and the in best technology to deliver what our customers want and outperform technically.", "So, this is not the first high band win. We have been clocking and clicking design wins here for a while. This one was meaningful for us. It did move us up to some higher frequencies above 3 gigahertz and let me also remind you and I answered the question earlier that in some of these domains, there is a need for a TDD Time Division Duplexing versus FDD, Frequency Division and that can change the technology curve and the selection as well.", "So, it will continue to grow in that space. We\u2019ll continue to grow in mid band. We\u2019ll continue to move our TC technology up higher and continue to lead in low band as well.", "Quinn Bolton", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Thank you. I guess the first question, you did not answer before, revenue breakout by broad market mobile and PA, and then I had another question.", "Kris Sennesael", "Yes, so the broad market was approximately 25% of total revenue. Mobile was slightly above 60% and so the rest power amplifier is slightly below 15%.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Great. Thank you and then just a follow up on BAW and given the trend in carrier ag to have front-end that are going to cover a mix of high end low bands, is there a trigger point where you guys are obviously bullish on TC-SAW, but is there a trigger point where you decide you have to invest to add captive BAW and if so, what is that? I\u2019m just wondering how you think about the decision to sort BAW on a merchant basis or to invest in it captively. Thanks.", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, well let me start with you mentioned carrier aggregation. We have an incredible portfolio in carrier aggregation. It nothing to do with BAW. We can use TC-SAW. We can use other capabilities, organic capabilities and we're a market leader there without question. Looking now, there are opportunities where a higher frequency, high performance BAW filtering makes a lot of sense, but we don\u2019t sell discrete devices.", "So, our plan is to try to create the best engine, the best complete sub system that meets our customer's needs. In many cases, we can do it with our organic technology. We do have a path foundry partners to bring in BAW within our modules if needed. Our TC-SAW capabilities continue to improve and if you look at spectrum, the most crowded spectrum is in the lower frequency bands. 700 meg up to 1.1 gig, very, very crowded.", "TC-SAW capabilities are ideal. Bulk acoustic wave can\u2019t play at those lower frequencies and anywhere some frequencies that are very high with extremely high performance needs where BAW\u2019s critical. So, we\u2019re not hindered by any of that. I think we feel very comfortable with our outlook. We have a lot of great technology choices.", "And if you look across the peer group, there are some players in our space that don\u2019t in-house gallium arsenide. They go to foundry partners. So, it's not uncommon to have a few points of technology where you outsource in partner and we do that on occasion, but invariably, we use our own organic products.", "Timothy Arcuri", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question, we'll go to the line of Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Cody Acree", "Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress. Liam, may be if I can say that last question another way, I guess can you just talk about your filter roadmap, your capacity plans, you had talked or maybe your predecessor had talked previously about specifically getting into BAW capability and I guess with those foundry partners in BAW, are you capacity constraint or are you limited as to some of those sockets you can get into just from a market availability?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, sure well let me start with the organic product line. So, we have a really strong competitive left in with our TC-SAW facility, SAW Japan as you may remember, this came about through our joint venture with Panasonic, which is now wholly owned entity with Skyworks.", "And we have capacity to do about 3 billion units of TC-SAW per year and we have room right now. We're not a full utilization, but we have a really strong pipeline going forward that\u2019s going to enjoy the benefit of those filters.", "If you look at what we can do, it's just really again, it depends on the customers' need, it depends on whether you are in a frequency duplexing domain or a time division duplexing domain. There is nuisances there and so we try to match the best complete system with the customer need. We do have BAW, we're completely aware of BAW acoustic wave technology and what it can and can't do. We have strong partners right now that we can bring it in on a foundry basis.", "We continue to look within the walls of our company to do it organically or construct devices that are just as competitive organically. Some of that is TDD. What I'll tell you today we enjoy a robust opportunity with the filtering we have today augmented by our gallium arsenide or switching our packaging and our complete systems focus.", "Cody Acree", "And then Kris maybe on the OpEx side, you constrained spending to this last year where revenue was in decline, but it sounds like you are getting right back into a bid of spending on IoT and other areas. Can you talk about where you're spending and what your plans are for this year?", "Kris Sennesael", "Yes, absolutely. So Q1 came in at $113 million up $6 million from Q4, but keep in mind that we started accruing for incentives again and so going forward, we target to have our OpEx on or about 13% of revenue.", "So, you will continue to see some modest increases quarter-over-quarter there as well. 13% is actually I believe world class and so I feel good about that level of investments that we make. We definitely make sure that we continue to make the necessary investments to further diversify the business in the broader market in IoT and we won't hesitate to make those investments.", "Cody Acree", "Thanks. Congrats.", "Kris Sennesael", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Toshiya Hari", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on China and I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on what trends you saw in fiscal Q1? If you can provide kind of a year-over-year number that would be great. And also, if you can talk about your expectations for fiscal Q2, again specific to China? And then on inventory, how comfortable are you today in terms of inventory in China both in the supply chain and also in retail?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, sure, well, China of course is a meaningful growth driver for Skyworks. I mentioned earlier on the call it's about 25% of our revenue all in. And it's a market that consumes and exports, right. We have a lot of Tier 1 players that are moving up and inside Huawei and then it's an export market as well and we can enjoy both sides of that.", "One of the things that has helped us in China is having a strong baseband partnerships, very tight coupling with Hisilicon captive to Huawei today. Also, a lengthy relationship with MediaTek and MediaTek is really in route now to move towards higher levels of integration adopting SkyOne like structures from Skyworks that's a big pop and names like Oppo and Vivo continue to look strong for us.", "We don't do much at all with the 3G and 2G white box markets. So, our revenue is really driven around the market leaders. And I'll tell you that right now Huawei is the one that's really stepping up in content and the others are moving along that curve. So, I think there is going to be some upgrade opportunities within 4G with some of the mid and value tier players within China.", "Kris Sennesael", "And so, on your second question on inventory in the channel, we actually feel very good about the level of inventory in the channel. Most if not all of the inventory that we had with our largest customer has been consummated and so we don't see any issue in terms of inventory in the channel.", "Liam Griffin", "Right and that's China as well, so that's global in China specifically.", "Toshiya Hari", "Okay. Great. And then as my follow-up, I had a question on your production ramp in Japan. I guess I am curious which inning are we in the ramp and what are the implications for gross margins going forward as we continue to ramp that facility?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, the facility has several innings of opportunity ahead. It continues to be competitive weapon. And we've got our growing list of customers and expanding set of new frequencies that we're going to be addressing. So, it continues to be an important weapon.", "I believe right now if we look at our outlook, we'll probably be okay for capacity for a bit, but just depends on how big our designs wins are here going into the second half. But I think that the factory is running well, increasing number of customers enjoying that benefit and the demand signal for integration -- intergraded duplex's, integrated filtering for us has been tremendous.", "Kris Sennesael", "So, we continue to in source some of the filter fabrication there as well. And we haven't really quantified that, but it's going to have a meaningful impact on our further gross margin improvement in the second half of 2017.", "Toshiya Hari", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.", "Craig Ellis", "Thanks for taking the question guys and nice job on the execution. Liam, I wanted to ask to ask an intermediate to long-term question, it's nice to see the business back to 8% year-on-year growth in the fiscal second quarter. So, the question is as you look at the business, what's your view on the potential for this return to year-on-year growth, could be sustainable year-on-year growth and what do you think the right level of longer-term growth is for Skyworks given the portfolio mix that you have and the investments that you're making in the business?", "Liam Griffin", "Yes, no, I appreciate that and you're right. I think we weathered a bit of storm here in '16 and most of the clouds there have abated and it's not just market shares. We\u2019re gaining share, we\u2019re creating new content. We\u2019re expanding in IOT and in broad markets and its meaningful and its sustainable.", "We\u2019re confident that the second half for us should be a double-digit growth rate year-over-year. We think we\u2019ll have strength going into the next fiscal year as well just given our outlook and our design wins that we've secured recently. So, we feel good about it. Again, there is room to go on the margin line. We\u2019re going to work that. The demand side let's say, looks very good and more diversified I should add.", "Craig Ellis", "Thanks for that and then the follow-up Kris regarding the quarter, you may have mentioned earlier perhaps I missed it, but can you specify where the upside was from on a segment basis? It looks like on a revenue mix basis it must have been coming from integrated mobile, but is that correct or was it somewhere else.", "Kris Sennesael", "Yeah on a sequential basis mobile was the strongest growth driver absolutely.", "Craig Ellis", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig Hallum. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Stoss", "Hi guys, my congrats as well. You bumped up CapEx in the quarter. I'm curious if you can give us more detail on what percentage of that is going towards TC-SAW? Also, Liam if you won't mind, give us an update on your -- I know your GPS newer solutions are starting to ramp an update on that as well as SkyBlue? Thanks.", "Kris Sennesael", "So, the vast majority of the CapEx was actually in our backend facility where we continue to expand our capacity.", "Liam Griffin", "Right. Tony and also GPS, GPS has really been prolific here over the last two or three quarters and forward-looking outlook as more and more devices now location services matter, highly precise locations matter. And we have some really unique things that we do in our Mexicali factory to shield and kind of manage the complexity of GPS and the size requirement.", "So, that continues to roll out and it\u2019s a big driver in IOT. So, we have attachment across mobile, but the number of IOT nodes that we could lever with GPS I think is quite compelling and that's in other case where we're just starting to rack up the design wins. We have really good technology. It takes advantage of some of the core IP that we have in the amplifiers that we have today in cellular and trying to design and shape those for other applications.", "Anthony Stoss", "And then as a follow-up, I know you guys in the past talked about a midterm goal of 52% gross margins. Has anything changed in your view in getting there?", "Kris Sennesael", "No, absolutely not. We have our goal to get to the 53% gross margin. We've 30% operating expense and that get you to 40% operating margin. And so, we're committed to that and driving the whole organization very hard to go and execute towards it.", "Anthony Stoss", "Great job, guys. Thank you.", "Liam Griffin", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Atif Malik", "Hi, thanks for taking my question and Liam, a good job on the execution since you took over last year. My question is on the guidance, can you just qualitatively talk about how do you see the mobile and the broad markets in the March quarter relatively they're down 8% sequential decline?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. Yes, the broad markets in IOT space should be up about 10% to 12% roughly. If mobile is not typically bullish here in the March quarter, we do have unique customer dynamic where some customers in fact are up even within mobile and that\u2019s all about content. So, it\u2019s not a particularly unusual signal.", "One of the reasons why we\u2019re doing better than seasonal is just again a higher growth rate in the broad space and also with one of our larger customers in Korea content step up, which also provides a sequential gain in revenue.", "Atif Malik", "Okay. And then Chris on the last call, you talked about 100 basis points of gross margin improvement exiting fiscal '17. I understand that there is some sequential weakness in the gross margin guide because the revenues are coming down, are we still on track for that 100 basis points improvement exiting fiscal '17?", "Kris Sennesael", "Yes, as I said before, Q2 is a seasonal soft quarter. It\u2019s the low end of the gross margin and so we're driving really hard to further improvements in Q2 and Q3 as we strengthen the business and expect to successfully grow the revenue in the next two, three quarters.", "Operator", "Next, we\u2019ve the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. ", "Vijay Rakesh", "Hi guys. Just looking at inventory looks like it stayed flat through the December quarter. How do you see inventory exiting the March quarter?", "Kris Sennesael", "Yes, first of all again I\u2019m very pleased with the fact that we have been able to drive down inventory days. Remember in Q3 it was 108 days. It can down in Q4 to 94 days and we now are at 86 days. Again, Q1 is a seasonally soft quarter and we do see a lot of strength in our business in the second half with double-digit year-over-year growth in the second half.", "And of course, the second quarter we are going to prepare for that and so we are increasing our factory loadings and as a result of that, you will see an increase in inventory during the March quarter as well an absolute dollars as in days of inventories.", "Vijay Rakesh", "Got it and just one follow-up here, on the gross margin I saw you mentioned that you still see a 52%, 53% gross margin target. The gross margins have stayed in that 50%, 51% for the last four quarters. Can you give us what the puts and takes are? Is that a 6 inch to 8 inch transition or how do you see the margins work or drives that? Thanks.", "Kris Sennesael", "So, the present group margin expansion is basically coming from three ways. First of all, and I repeat myself here, but we do see drastic revenue growth in the second half of '17 and of course revenue growth helps with the fixed cost absorption and the margin expansion.", "Secondly, we continue to execute on our cost reduction programs and operational efficiencies that will continue to have further margin improvements and then last and we talked already a little bit about that, we continue to ramp the filter factory, continue with our insourcing into the filter factory and that will also further drive margin improvements.", "Operator", "Next, we go to Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Josh Burkhalter", "Hi, this is Josh Burkhalter on behalf of Rick. Congratulations on the great results. I wanted to re-ask a question that was asked previously, but on a longer term. So, in the medium term you mentioned you think you can grow above the RF industry in general. I was wondering how much of that do you think is derived from broad markets versus mobile?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure, sure. We\u2019ll take a shot at that. Well, the broad market opportunity is more unbounded right. There is really kind of an infinite set of customers that we're addressing and moving the dial across the Board whether it be just adding the new applications and new customers.", "And then even within IoT, there's a content opportunity where the customers and consumers they get used to a low range technology want to augment it perhaps with higher-end solutions maybe they had MIMO and Wi-Fi or maybe they go from a wearable technology that is just Wi-Fi and then it stretches to LTE. So, there is an action there that I think has tremendous upside and really the market continues to expand.", "In mobile, mobile is more characterized. I know there's a lot of detail on the unit count. There is a lot of detail on customer innovation, interaction, but what is missed in mobile is again this tremendous economy that relies upon the hardware and relies upon the kind of technology that we offer and so what we see there and it\u2019s been increasing, is a continued push for performance-oriented solutions and every year there is a different requirement, there is a different opportunity for us to expand upon may be its frequency bands, may be its bringing in new opportunity for us to expand upon maybe it's frequency bands, maybe it's brining in new technologies.", "We talked about Wi-Fi and GPS there happening, they're happening in some cases. Diversity we see as a new solution for Skyworks. So, all that continues to move and then we have this major 5G upgrade cycle on the horizon. It's a few years out, but Skyworks will be very well positioned there and when that does occur, you will have the backward compatibility for 4G and 3G.", "So, you'll basically have some duplication of content or some enrichment in content without the legacy going away. So, there is a lot of things on the horizon if you look out. Again, the near term looks good. We talked about it, but if you think long about where the markets are headed and the continuous demand for mobile technology and mobile data and the economy that we've been speaking out far, it looks promising.", "Josh Burkhalter", "Okay. Thank you. And then on the last earnings call, you mentioned you had some mid band wins in China and also selling some SkyOne integrated products to media tech customers. Are there any -- are those meaningfully contributing and how should we expect, how are you viewing the traction there so far? Thank you.", "Liam Griffin", "Yes. Good question. They're contributing, but there's a long way to go in terms of the adoption. While we've talked a lot about, they're embracing this technology now and it's been great for them, it's been great for us and I think it's going to propel their business with the performance driven product, a number of products and we're seeing that move up a bit.", "MediaTek is a partner of ours. We're working with them and their reference designs to continue to bring integration to the masses in China. Some of the value Tier players Oppo and Vivo for example are moving along that curve, but they're still not to where we expect them to be.", "So, that's a continuous process and that doesn\u2019t mean units have to go up. That's really the content and again there is a big, big opportunity for us value tier moving up to mid-level and high levels of performance and bringing the kind of technology that we have into their products.", "Operator", "As we are approaching the top of the hour in our allocated time, we have one final question. It will come from the line of Bill Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Bill Peterson", "Yes, thanks for sneaking me in and congrats on the quarterly execution. I wanted to kind of maybe ask within broad markets a few questions. I guess first can you help us understand some of the more let's say higher growth segments within broad markets and then compare that with the more legacy products for the example base stations as we think about growth in that in this 2017?", "Liam Griffin", "Sure. I think the highest growth categories are really around the connected home high-speed access points and routers. You got these HD cameras. We have design wins with the whole Google net suite. We have design wins with the Netgear, Linksys, Ubiquiti, Wi-Fi mesh. That continues to roll and the content in some of these access points and routers and gateways could be very high, can be double-digit content. A lot of it is Wi-Fi and there are some other switching technology as well.", "We're then taking that and spanning out into a variety of newer opportunities early innings with products like drones and we have designs there. Automotive, we think could be a phenomenal catalyst for us for semiconductors in general and for Skyworks. If you think about what really matters in an autonomous car, the connectivity piece right. We have cars today. We're all driving cars, but connectivity is going to really matter.", "So, in order to make that market work, we're going to need very aggressive 5G solutions, massively expanded data pipe for both the transmit and downlink. All of that's going to be incredible opportunity for us and broad markets are that's going to be out there a few years.", "Cellular infrastructure has been a market we've enjoyed for a while. It's not the fastest growing market. It's solid from a market perspective and we have a number of players there that we're engaged with and that also will go through a 5G upgrade cycle.", "Bill Peterson", "Okay. Thanks for that, and then within broad markets too, I noticed in the recent investor call it last year, you talked about your various let's say tools in your tool chest and one of them you mentioned was in the presentation was actually GaN. Just curious where do you stand again in terms of productization and strategy with GaN and maybe early it seems like it's early within GaN, but wanted to kind of ask more of a longer ranging question relative to that part of your portfolio.", "Liam Griffin", "We have within the portfolio. It's not a significant piece, but it does play in some of the infrastructure markets. It plays in some optical products. We have a little bit of business there, but we monitor the right technology for the application and for the customer need. The gallium arsenide technology that we have as you know we have two very significant fabs are really highly customized and curated gas solutions that proliferate our portfolio.", "We do have some opportunities with foundry partners to bring in SOI and some other variance around the semiconductor space. And we had access again as needed. So, it's not a mission critical technology. We have access to it. It may play a little further out here in 5G, but at this point it's on our radar screen and it's an opportunity.", "Bill Peterson", "Okay. Thanks for the color and congrats again.", "Liam Griffin", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over for any closing comments.", "Liam Griffin", "Thank you, operator and thank you all for participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences and other events during the quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Vice President of Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.", "Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Year-End 2017 Conference Call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K, for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for our complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Liam.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team produced record results in Q4 in fiscal 2017, demonstrating our traction within the increasingly vibrant and profitable Mobile and IoT ecosystems. Let me begin with a few fourth quarter highlights. We delivered revenue of $985 million, up 18% year-over-year, and above our guidance. We expanded gross margin by 30 basis points, and operating margin by 150 basis points sequentially. We achieved earnings per share of $1.82, up 24% year-over-year, $0.07 ahead of consensus. For the full year, we generated revenues of $3.7 billion, up 11%, with earnings per share of $6.45, up 16% year-over-year. And we produced exceptional operating cash flow, $1.5 billion, up 34% from last year.", "In addition to our strong financial performance, we've significantly expanded the aperture of our design win pipeline. Last quarter, we broadened our reach across all premier customers. Specifically, we powered Samsung's Galaxy and Note platforms, with proprietary DRx and SkyOne solutions, while adding GPS and DC/DC converters. We enabled Huawei's newest premium smartphones with low, mid and high band SkyOne, Wi-Fi, carrier aggregation, and proprietary SkyBlue power management solutions. And we leveraged SkyLiTE and SkyOne across new platforms at Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Motorola.", "And across our broad markets, we delivered fully integrated Zigbee and ISM modules for Bosch home security and Cisco's smart lighting systems. We commenced volume production of in-vehicle telematics at Hyundai, and launched wireless networking engines within DirecTV's 4K Genie receivers. We also supported Sonos' latest hi-fi speaker featuring Amazon Alexa. And we introduced next-generation 802.11ax Wi-Fi solutions, enabling a fourfold increase in speed and supporting up to 50 simultaneous users. We secured connectivity wins at DJI for virtual reality and drone applications, supplied precision GPS and antenna tuning for Fitbit's newest smart watches, and we unveiled high power solutions with leading base station customers for 5G MIMO deployments.", "So to summarize, we delivered yet another year of record results, capturing strategic design wins across all key market segments, while strengthening our balance sheet. At a higher level, the ubiquitous connected economy is gaining significant momentum and enhancing the way we live, work, play, and educate. The growth opportunity is enormous. Global mobile data usage is expected to grow five times between 2017 and 2021. IoT volumes are exploding, with 75 billion devices projected by 2025. And there is still the opportunity to connect the unconnected, which today represents over 2 billion people worldwide.", "In parallel, the applications driving our business are expanding to now include connected homes, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, wearables, as well as network infrastructure. And by definition, these applications would not be possible without fast, secure, power-efficient connectivity solutions provided by Skyworks.", "As we've previously discussed, the equity market is recognizing this macro-tend as powerful, highly profitable and accelerating. In fact, if we look at today's top five S&P 500 companies by market cap, they are all demonstrating successful monetization of the rapidly growing mobile economy. As a group, these five companies have created 2 trillion of incremental shareholder value since 2012, a clear testament to the strength of this industry. Meanwhile, the broad range of usage cases and expanding scope of newly connected platforms are creating an increasingly crowded radio spectrum, stressing network capacity and slowing data throughput.", "Our mission is to enable this data-driven world and alleviate the looming digital traffic jam. This will require an inflection point in global communication standards, and that's 5G. 5G will represent a significant boost in speed, up to 100 times that that we see in 4G networks. 5G will offer extremely low latency, a requirement for mission-critical applications such as driverless cars, machine-to-machine, and robotics. And 5G will be a key enabler to a massive rollout of IoT, greatly expanding network capacity and improving reliability. 5G will also spawn new and previously unimagined applications, while greatly enhancing the performance and utility of existing mobile platforms.", "We will see this reflected in new unit growth in IoT applications and also across the global smartphone installed base. Keep in mind, the 5 billion subscribers today all operate on 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. In order to make the leap to 5G, system architectures will require significantly more powerful connectivity engines to ensure the intense performance challenges are realized. This upgrade wave will create an enormous growth catalyst for the entire smartphone ecosystem. And as a leader in unwiring the planet, Skyworks is well-positioned to capitalize, with extensive technology breadth and depth, strategic partnerships with all leading smartphone and IoT customers, differentiated system solutions enabling unmatched levels of integration and performance, all underpinned by our aggressive investments over the past two decades to expand our product portfolio, IP and scale.", "As a result, we have the profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet to extend our leadership position. Our strategic R&D and CapEx investments will be pivotal as the scale and technology requirements around 5G intensify. Finally, and most importantly, we are committed to delivering premium levels of profitability with above-market growth, while continuing to create sustainable shareholder value.", "I will now turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q1.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 was a record $985 million, up 9% sequentially and up 18% compared to Q4 of last year, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was $502 million or 51% of revenue, up 30 basis points sequentially following 30 basis points of sequential improvement in the June quarter. Operating expense were $123 million or 12.5% of revenue. As a result, we generated $379 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 38.5%, up 150 basis points sequentially. Our tax rate was 11.1%, driving net income of $339 million or $1.82 of diluted earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $0.07. Fourth quarter EPS of $1.82 was up 16% sequentially and 24% compared to Q4 of last year.", "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, fourth fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $425 million, and capital expenditures were $85 million. Dividends paid were $59 million, and we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock for a total of $102 million.", "As this is the fourth and last quarter of fiscal 2017, let's also review our annual results. We delivered a record $3.7 billion of revenue, up 11% year-over-year. Operating income was $1.4 billion, and net income was $1.2 billion, translating into $6.45 of diluted earnings per share, up 16% versus last year. In addition to the strong top and bottom line year-over-year growth, we generated cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion, up 34% from fiscal 2016. CapEx for the year was $300 million, resulting in $1.2 billion of free cash flow or a 32% free cash flow margin. We returned 55% of the free cash flow to shareholders, with $215 million of dividend payments and $432 million in share buybacks, as we repurchased just over 4.6 million shares throughout the fiscal year. We ended fiscal 2017 with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and no debt.", "Now moving to our outlook for fiscal Q1. We plan for revenue to be up 15% year-over-year to $1.05 billion, with gross margin expansion to the 51% to 51.5% range. Operating expense are expected to be $127 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $2.5 million in other income, and a tax rate of 14.5%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 185.5 million shares. Accordingly, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.91, an increase of 19% year-over-year, demonstrating our sustained operating leverage.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Kris. Skyworks enters fiscal 2018 with strong momentum. Our outperformance is being driven by a vibrant, dynamic Mobile ecosystem, one that rewards companies who can resolve architectural complexity with simplified integrated solutions. The value inherent in the connected economy is apparent in our results. In the past five years, our revenues have more than doubled, EPS has more than tripled, and operating cash is up five times.", "In closing, our ambitious vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time has never been more relevant and exciting. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Okay. Our first question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Atif Malik - Citi Research", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and good job on the execution. First question, the gross margins, Kris, if you can talk about what's driving the gross margin expansion into the December quarter, and then I have a follow-up.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, so first of all, I'm pleased with the ongoing gross margin expansion. As we said in the prepared remarks, we added 30 basis point in June, we added 30 basis points in September here, and for December, we guide gross margin up between 0 to 50 basis points. And so, the way we do that is three elements. Of course, more revenue, more volume helps with size and scale and fixed cost absorption, that's one. Secondly, we continue to drive operational efficiencies across all our operations and with our third-party suppliers. And then last but not least, we continue to make good progress on filter insourcing. As a reminder, roughly 50% of the filters we use are being produced in-house, and 50% is purchased from third parties. We are moving towards a 75%/25% allocation there and making good progress in that. And so, when you combine this all, we continue to make good progress and moving towards our target of 53% gross margin.", "Atif Malik - Citi Research", "Great. And then, Liam, your execution has been very strong. This year, you're outgrowing your peers on a tender basis, particularly in China with major OEMs like Huawei picking up your RF solution. If I look at \u2013 historically, your share in China has been mid 20s. Can you talk about what your market share or the percent of your sales could be this year? And how much of this is permanent or in terms of share gains into next year?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, I'll try to give you as much color as I can here. Well, as you know, I mean, China has been a strategic market for us for some time. It's a growing market. It's also a market that not only produces product in country, it exports. And as you've seen lately, they've also been a great consumer of global Tier 1 phones, so there's a lot that goes into that mix. For us, the theme that we're seeing right now and the theme that we're capitalizing on is this move towards higher-end performance within China. Huawei is a great example, where we have mid band, high band, low band, SkyOne, DRx technology, power technology, really rich content, moving that to Oppo and Vivo and Xiaomi as well. So, the real theme for us is moving that content up, moving that performance level up. And we're really happy to see that the consumer in China is up for that and asking for those products.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Congrats on the progress.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Liam, if you could maybe just follow up on that last question. If we go back to statements that Qorvo made on their conference call, they were talking about a consumer movement in China toward middle-market phones, cheaper phones that have, obviously, lower RF dollar content. It's definitely different from what you just stated, I guess. Can you maybe help us to square that a bit what you're seeing maybe versus their comment?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, well, I think, both can be right. There's a low end, there's a mid end, and then there's a premium end. We participate in both the premium and the mid-tier, not so much in the low end. But where we're seeing real acceleration is when you look at $3 to $4 content 4G product moving up to higher end 4G that could be $6 or $7. That theme is playing out very well. We still have participation in the mid-tier, but again, the driving theme right now is about getting global phones that are rich in content that can sell in China, can sell even outside of China. So that's where we're seeing the benefit. I mean, Huawei has been a class case study for us. We've done extremely well with that customer. We've engaged early. We have incredible relationships and have been able to drive a wonderful set of products through their portfolio. And that's not changing.", "Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Thank you for that. And then lastly, the Street has gotten pretty used to pretty inarguable beat-and-raise quarters out of you guys, and so a good September quarter but relatively in line December guidance. And with the delay of a launch of your largest customer, what might that be doing to the December to March transition? And does maybe what might be considered a little lighter December mean we might see a little stronger March?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, well, here's what I can tell you, Cody. We have a process for our guidance. We look through our backlog position. There's not a lot of speculation. We have great visibility in the current quarter as to where we are. And our job is to try to cement our designs with the right customers in the right markets, whether they're in mobile, whether they're in IoT or infrastructure. And the team has done a great job of putting great product with the right companies. And then it's up to the customers to actually deliver on the mix side on their end. So, some of that is out of our control, but we have a balanced view with the Q1. We don't really have any guidance for you yet for March, but I wouldn't expect anything different than from kind of our normal signature there. But we go through that process every quarter and nothing has really changed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Bill Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Yeah, thanks for letting me ask a question, and congrats as well on the quarter. I guess, can you give us a feel as you've done in the past on the size of broad markets in the quarter as well, I guess, first is mobile?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yes, Bill, so broad markets was approximately 26% of total revenue. Our integrated mobile was 64% of total revenue, and the Power Amplifiers was approximately 10%. So, I'm definitely very pleased with broad markets at 26% of total revenue. So we actually exceeded more than $250 million of quarter revenue in broad markets. So we've now over $1 billion in annualized revenue in that market. As you could hear from the prepared remarks, we have a lot of design win momentum in that segment. We experience a lot of growth in that segment and so that's definitely helping us to overall grow our business.", "Bill Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thanks for that color. And I guess, if we look in the next year based out of your design win pipeline, I guess, which of the two between mobile and broad markets would you expect to go faster at this stage? And I guess, that's just kind of a content question as well for mobile but also just the pipeline you have for the broad market side. Thank you.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yes, so broad market in fiscal 2017 has been growing high teens full year, year-over-year. We expect that to continue to grow mid-teens, mid to high teens, so we definitely see a lot of growth there, but at the same time, of course, we are very bullish about our mobile markets as well and continue to see double-digit growth in that area.", "Bill Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great, thanks for taking my questions. My first question, I just wanted to follow up on the broad markets question. I realize that this segment is exposed to many, many customers and many, many end products, but if you can point to some of the drivers in the quarter, and perhaps the areas where you have high expectations going into calendar 2018, that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, Toshi. It really is a broad set of applications and customers. I think one important point is the ability for Skyworks to create a broad and growing presence in the actual wireless topology. So we're offering Wi-Fi, 11ac, 11ax. We're offering Bluetooth, we're offering ZigBee, we're offering GPS. There's really a wide range of topologies that we bring, and even cellular in some of these applications.", "So that allows us to manage opportunities and grow the business, whether it's short-data range devices, whether it's devices that demand a stronger signal, faster data rate, longer-range, premium Wi-Fi. The customer set, we rattled off a few in the prepared remarks, continues to grow. There's connected home devices, there's security systems, there's more and more video applications that really drive a tremendous amount of content for us. So it's quite diversified. There's customers with applications and then there's the breadth of wireless topologies that we bring that really creates the differentiation.", "Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. And as my follow-up, we've heard from Broadcom as it relates to their bid for Qualcomm, and I'm thinking you guys have spent some time at least brainstorming what the implications could be for the overall industry and for your business. Perhaps you haven't, but in case you have, how should we think about the impact to you guys, what are the potential benefits, potential negatives when you think about a potential team-up between the two companies? Thank you.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, well, it's very early to call the implications here, but one of the things I would say is it clearly shows the value and significance of this mobile economy that we've been talking about for a while. This is a really significant change in the way we work, live, play, monetize. So I think it speaks to that. For us, we have great position with both of those parties. We do a lot of work with Qualcomm, we've had a lot of work with Broadcom Avago on Wi-Fi. So for us, I think that we would certainly be able to coexist with those folks. But think again about the statement that I see on this is the value of mobile and the economy that's supported by it, and I think that's the big takeaway here.", "Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, thank you. And Liam, maybe if we could just stay with that theme of the high level, and since you've been on board, you have pretty much laid out your conviction on the business. And it sounds like you're \u2013 the change at least that I get is that you're not that interested in diversification just for the sake of diversification. Is that the right way to think about how you view your business and, as you just laid out, the mobile economy as you highlighted in your prepared remarks? And then I have a quick follow-up.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, well, I will say that my conviction in Skyworks and what we're doing is sound, and I'm really excited and happy about the execution of this team. And we've laid out a framework a few years back and even longer about what we want to accomplish. And I think we're doing quite well. There's more to do. But what I think about really is, we can call it mobile, we can call it connected, but there's definitely a big change in this industry. It's cloud-to-client, it's driverless cars, it's IoT, it's 5G smartphones. There's no question that the opportunity in those markets is unmatched. I don't see anything else in semiconductors, quite frankly that would compare to it.", "So we're really excited about that. And that's where you're hearing the dialogue and the conviction. Now, are there other things that could occur? Are there other potential partnerships or deals that could be made? Absolutely. And the balance sheet and the cash generation really gives us more and more options to do that. But day to day, we love what we do here, and there's just so much great opportunities in front of us.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Thank you. And my quick follow-up, Kris, on the full year, could you \u2013 just for modeling purposes, how should we think about the OpEx trajectory and also CapEx? Thank you.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, so for OpEx, there's no change there. We've said in the past, we are keeping our OpEx on or about 13% to revenue. Of course, there will be some seasonal fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but on a full-year basis, the target is 13% to revenue, so if you have double-digit top-line growth that allows us to make strategic events in R&D and sales and marketing to capture more value, which is out there in the market.", "On CapEx, we are running high-single digits as a percent to revenue for CapEx in fiscal 2017, and you can expect the same in fiscal 2018. Here, again, we are making the strategic investments in our filter operation, not only expanding the capacity but also making technology investments to widen the scope of our technology. And a similar thing is going on in our back-end operation, capacity expansion, as well as technology investments that we are making.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Thank you. Good luck.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Wills Miller - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. This is Wills Miller for Vivek. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the results.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Wills Miller - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I guess, first, if I look at your December quarter sales growth guidance, it seems a bit below seasonal. Can you just talk about the puts and takes there?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "So, for December, we are guiding up 9% sequentially and up \u2013 sorry, for December, 7% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. I think that's a pretty strong guidance. It's really hard to look at what is normal seasonality when you compare 2017 or 2016 or 2015. The last couple of years has not been really normal. So, again, 7% sequential, 15% year-over-year, I consider that a very strong guidance.", "Wills Miller - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's helpful, thank you. And just a quick one. What was your largest customer as a percent of sales in the September quarter?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "So our three largest customers has not changed, obviously. It's Foxconn, Samsung, and Huawei. And so on a full-year basis, our largest customer is in the high 30s, approaching 40% of total revenue. Samsung is in the low teens, and Huawei is on or about 10%.", "Wills Miller - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder, Charter Equity. Please go ahead.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Thanks. Merced announced they went to Wi-Fi (28:07) each quarter there, which is an interesting development, given you guys have not done a lot of modules in that. I know a few, but not on this scale before. Just generally, what are the ASPs of those modules in the typical $1 to $4 range for Wi-Fi module? Are they more like SkyOne? And where are you in the design pipeline with that? Are you sampling and qualified, designed in) or in production?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "With respect to Wi-Fi modules, Ed, was that it?", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Yes.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Okay. Yeah, I mean, we've been working higher and higher levels of integration with our Wi-Fi solutions from basically just single chip solutions to multi-mode devices to fully integrated systems. So we're along that curve right now. We have some customers that are deeply engaged and are looking forward to a complete module, which would definitely enhance the ASP. And then we have some other customers that are halfway there that still look at integration beyond just the chip level. So, it's a work in progress. I think one thing that does create tremendous advantage for Skyworks is our ability to integrate through Mexicali our package assembly and test, our ability to bring in filters now through our Panasonic deal, as well as our strength just at the chip level in Wi-Fi. So those elements are in place. It's just about bringing them together, harmonizing them and then bringing them to market.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "And then, Kris, if I could, last year, you had high channel inventory going into the \u2013 in the second half of the year, and it kept you from seeing any real revenue from a legacy product at your largest customer. That's got to be a tailwind this year. Are we talking $10 million or $50 million? Can you give us a scale on that? And Liam, one more for you, there was a question about Broadcom and Qualcomm, I just want to follow up with that. Are you seeing any serious comp today right now in the market, are you seeing any serious competition or any competition at all from RF360 on the RF/Analog side? By that, I mean, not the ET solution, which is tied to their base, and which they always claim is (30:00) RF360, but any components that you sell in the space, are you seeing anything from them?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "So Ed, I'll take the first one on channel inventory, that is very much normal. It's not high, it's not low, it's right where it's supposed to be.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Right. And then on the RF360, Ed, we really haven't seen much of a change. I know there's efforts for that product across the globe, but we really haven't seen anything substantial.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "So they're not really a serious competitor to you today?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Right.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Yeah. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Mike Burton, Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Mike Burton - Longbow Research LLC", "Thanks, and congrats on the strong September numbers. Looks like you had a lot of ramps across your customer base in September. Can you help us understand some of the pieces in the quarter a little better? You obviously had a ramp from your largest customer, but was Samsung and the China OEMs also up sequentially? And any color there for the September quarter, but also how you would expect them to trend into December would be helpful. Thanks.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, sure. Yeah, this was \u2013 Q4 was really kind of the early stages of launches for really the suite of top tier mobile players. And that will carry through in our strong December guidance here today. It's great to see diversification across a higher set of customers that are all kind of adopting now variations on DRx and variations on SkyOne and some of the other what would have been kind of classic analog type product, our switching products, some of our antenna tuning products, GPS. We're starting to see that portfolio really grow among the high tier. You saw a bit of it in the September quarter, and it really is kind of the leaders that will propel us here in the December quarter.", "Mike Burton - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, and then sorry if I missed it, but as we look at gross margins heading into fiscal 2018, what are some of the puts and takes we should consider or how should we think about modeling that going forward? Thanks.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, so we only guide one quarter at a time, and so we provide you with the guidance for the December quarter, 51% to 51.5%. And so, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're making good progress towards our target model of 53%, and so we'll, quarter after quarter, make further progress towards that target model.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christian Sayaka (32:33) with Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I just want to first dig into the tax rate on this quarter. It clearly came in materially lower than your guidance. And I'm calculating it to roughly a 5% benefit to EPS this quarter. Can you just delve in a bit deeper as to what happened this quarter on that tax rate and where \u2013 and if we should expect this to flow through for fiscal 2018? Thanks.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Right, so we did beat on an EPS line with $0.07, $0.02 of that was operational benefits, higher revenue, and $0.05 came from a lower tax rate. The tax rate came in at 11.1% in Q4, and on a full-year basis it was 12.8%. That's the non-GAAP tax rate. That tax rate came in slightly below what we expected as we did some fiscal year-end true-up calculations. And we had a slightly more favorable mix between our domestic and foreign income. And that drove a little bit of a lower tax rate for fiscal 2017.", "For fiscal 2018, we provided guidance for Q1, 14.5%, and we also do expect on a full-year basis the tax rate to be on or about 14.5%. That obviously does not take into account any potential benefits from tax reform. It's too early to call that. But fiscal 2018 is slightly up from fiscal 2017, mainly as a result of a reduction in tax deductible stock-based compensation expenses.", "Unknown Speaker", "That's helpful, thank you. And then I just want to pivot back to the China market for a quick second. I've been hearing from some investors that there's actually been some de-specing going on in the RF content as you've seen some other pricing pressures from memory, display, so on and so forth. This is in clear contrast to what you guys are describing on the call right now and saying that you're seeing content increasing especially in the mid-end tiers. Can you maybe try and just, I guess, maybe try and describe if you have been seeing this trend in the market at all or maybe try and reconcile the differences from what I'm hearing to what you're saying? Thank you.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, sure, yeah. Well, I mean, China is a very broad, broad market with a lot of companies, a lot of customers. There are some mid-tier and low-tier players that are selling on price, and maybe de-specing is a way to get there in lowering their prices. But what we are seeing is \u2013 and our focus has been on mid to high, and on that segment, we see a push for performance. We're also seeing more and more China players like Huawei that will build a global phone that will carry frequencies and content that can be used globally not just specifically to China. And again, the next set of players starting to move up, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi are also are moving up from, in some cases, a lower base of content. And there can be de-specing in other areas. It doesn't rule out that that possibility exists in certain markets and certain customers. A great deal of mid-tier and low-end phones, they get built in China, get exported to emerging markets that may not have the same demands for performance. So it's possible that could be happening. In the area of focus that Skyworks is interested in, we continue to see the performance push.", "Unknown Speaker", "Excellent. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis, B. Riley. Please go ahead.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for taking the question, and nice execution in the quarter, guys. Just a couple clarifications at this point. First, Kris, you mentioned that you expect internal filter sourcing to get up to 75%. Over what time period would you expect that to occur from where we are today at around 50%?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "So we were at 50% a quarter ago, we are now somewhat halfway on towards our 75%. So we should be there in early 2018.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "Okay, thanks. And then, Liam, oftentimes at this time of year, given the design win visibility which you have, which is around 18 months or so, you have a pretty good sense for where content is shaking out for the coming year. So the question is, one, can you just qualitatively speak to content gains that you've seen now that all the major handsets have been announced in the back half of the year? And two, what's the content gain potential for broad markets next year both in Tier 1s and in some of the lower tiers where it seems like there's a good mix-up dynamic playing out to your favor?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, that makes sense. Yeah, so this is what we're seeing. And we have pretty good visibility now with the players. There's definitely going to be some early elements of 5G stepping into this market by 2018 into 2019. We talked a lot about 5G here in the opening comments, and as you know, this will be kind of additive to existing 3G and 4G engines. So you could have connectivity solutions, 3G, 4G, and then augmented with new content around 5G, new frequencies, new filtering, and in many cases, MIMO implementation as well.", "So there's a great opportunity there. It will take a while before it's fully implemented, but that is on the roadmap today. It's going to be a big driver on the mobile side. When you look at IoT, Craig, what we're seeing is a couple things. We're seeing a much broader proliferation now with more and more applications that we're able to address, whether it's with a Wi-Fi device or a Bluetooth device or embedding GPS for location, we're getting a broader set of applications. And we're also starting to see applications that we've already had step up through an upgrade. For example, smart watches that now carry cellular technology or a streaming media device that was a 2x2 MIMO for Wi-Fi that now carries nine streams of Wi-Fi to enhance speed and data rate. So, it's really twofold. It's the continuation of broadening the IoT reach, and then there's kind of the upgrade cycle within the IoT applications. So all that is opportunities for us looking forward.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Thank you. A couple of clarifications, I guess, just starting with that 5G topic. When do you think that'll be meaningful, Liam? And then before we get to 5G, obviously 4G premium has been driving your content for such a long time. What are the incremental content opportunities within 4G in the premium segment? I mean, do you think we'll continue to see tailwinds for content here before we get to 5G or do we take a little bit of a pause and then a step function increase when we go to 5G?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, no, that's a great question. So I think we're going to see a continuation here as we evolve from 4G to 5G. It won't be necessarily a step function, and I don't think we'll see a pause. And within each opportunity or each customer, they have their own story. I think that the winners in this market are the ones that are adopting performance-driven technology, customers that are adopting DRx-like systems that greatly enhance the downlink speed. We're seeing applications where we could have two or three DRx modules on the receive chain. That's really mirroring what we've been doing in transmit with SkyOne, low, mid, and high band. And most of our customers are somewhere along that continuum from a couple of modules to five or six modules.", "So there's a lot of work that we can do in 4G to grow our content and grow our business by populating existing customers with new technology and then also winning with some new accounts within mobile. And then when you look at 5G from an IoT perspective, one of the big, big drivers is creating that network capacity that can handle all of these devices. There's just going to be such a dispersion of devices, up to 25 billion or so by 2020 that we're going to need a new network to deliver those frequencies and deliver that data. So that's just another opportunity for connectivity through a number of different protocols, it could be Wi-Fi, it could be ZigBee, it could be cellular. But there's really going to be quite a massive upgrade cycle in the IoT space as well.", "Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. Thanks for that clarification. And then one \u2013 another clarification on the M&A front. You talked a little bit about diversification, but I guess, in the past, you did try to diversify a few years ago. That didn't work out. Given the strong balance sheet as well as the strong cash flow you're generating, maybe you could remind us what your M&A strategy is going forward. And if you don't find attractive opportunities out there, what are the plans with the cash? And what are the cash usage priorities?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, sure. Yeah, as I said earlier, we really do feel great about the outlook in the business that we're pursuing and the markets that we're pursuing. At the same time, we're up for diversification as long as it enhances the franchise. We're not as interested in things that are just totally adjacent on a different vector to diversify the portfolio. So, we got a great management team, we know how to enhance businesses, we've done a few deals that have turned out fantastic for us. Our joint venture with Panasonic, which is now a wholly-owned entity in Japan, has brought tremendous filtering technology. We did a deal for Wi-Fi with SiGe in 2012. That's been a home run. So the deals that we do are very careful and thought through, and we want our team to be able to execute on the entity that comes in. We'll continue to have that kind of a mindset as we look at potential opportunities going forward.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, let me just remind you, we have $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Half of that is onshore, half of that is offshore. We do have a very strong cash innovation capability with a free cash flow margin of 30%, 30-plus percent, but keep in mind that half of that cash is being generated onshore, half of the cash is being generated offshore. And so currently, our stated goal is to return 40% to 50% of that total free cash flow back to the shareholders through our dividend program and share buyback program. Actually, last year, we did 55% of total free cash flow, which means 100% of all the onshore cash generation was returned back to the shareholder. And we will continue to execute along that strategy.", "Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes, thank you. Just wanted to follow up on the topic of gross margins, and just given some of the recent trajectories there, your target of 53%, do you think it's just a matter of maybe it takes you longer to get there or how do you kind of frame the bridge to today and timeline of getting to 53%?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, no, we \u2013 first of all, we've never specified a timeline where we said we will continue to make quarter-after-quarter progress towards that target. And so, we continue to do so. I said we did 30 basis point in June, 30 basis point in September, we expect to do anywhere between 0 to 50 basis points in December. And so, it's a lot of hard work, but we continue to add more value in our products, in our solutions and at the same time continue to drive down the cost. And a combination of that will help us to get to that 53% gross margin.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, Craig, and the other thing just to keep in mind is that as our business is moving more and more towards these highly integrated, unique, custom solutions, the margins benefit. It's not only fewer competitors, but we're getting paid for the value-add, the engineer-to-engineer work, working within our customers' ecosystem to cement these really challenging \u2013 resolving these really challenging problems with elegant, some integrated solutions. So that's a theme that will continue. If we look out into 5G and some of these more complex markets, that's really going to be the strike zone of what we do at Skyworks. So we should be able to see margin benefit from that, in addition to looking within the company internally to become a more efficient operator.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks. And Liam, as a follow-up, as you think through 5G, you mentioned some early phase coming in, just even intermediate term, are there particular areas that excite you that from an R&D perspective, you'd look to be more opportunistic in terms of how you're evaluating where you're spending R&D?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, no, absolutely, I think couple things. You're going to see a wide range of new frequencies that will come about above 3 gigahertz, up to 6 gigahertz and beyond. That's going to create tremendous filtering opportunities. There's also some topology shifts from today, a 4G world, which is largely FDD, frequency-division duplexing. In 5G, a great deal of the frequencies will be in a TDD zone, time division, so our TC SAW product can play very, very well, even on high frequencies there. And then the level of integration and the amount of noise and interference within these modules, within these handsets is going to be unbelievable. And that requires very crafty solutions from companies like Skyworks to resolve it. So it's going to create a tremendous benefit to the consumer and a great uptake in speed and improvement in latency, but a lot of challenge for players like Skyworks. So we're looking forward to that.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Yeah, hi, guys. Just on the SAW, TC SAW, I was wondering if you could give some color of how your fiscal 2017 grew year-on-year from a SAW, TC SAW perspective, and how would you see fiscal 2018 given the cadence of 5G TDD? Thanks.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Yeah, well, we don't \u2013 as you may know, we don't sell any of that product discretely, so there's no specific revenue tied to SAW or TC SAW directly. However, you can certainly intimate that we are moving our portfolio up in frequency. We're leveraging our TC SAW now to 2.5 gig and potentially higher over the next couple of quarters. We're looking at all the different nuances in 5G. Again, I've mentioned FDD has a certain standard. TDD has a certain standard. There's implications for filtering. There's implications for switching and how we handle our SkyOne and DRx solutions.", "All that will come together. I think the important point though is that we have that flexibility, we have a very broad portfolio, all the way from gallium arsenide to switching to packaging and tests in Mexicali, selecting our own filters in-house. And occasionally, if we need to partner with whether it's a filter vendor or a strategic supplier for silicon, we have that in place. So it's going to be all about flexibility and managing the various configurations that we may see with our customers so as these 5G challenges build.", "Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Got it. And if you look at fiscal 2018, if you were to prioritize between the carrier aggregation picking up or .11ax or TDD for 5G, how do you look at what the drivers were for fiscal 2018 from the RF side?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, well, I mean, carrier aggregation is kind of in the middle innings right now and continuing to grow. And that's a sure thing. I mean, there's no question about the adoption on that. It's very hot and it's let get it done as fast as we can. 11ax is a relatively new standard in Wi-Fi. It has tremendous benefits in speed and performance. We'll be there. I think it's really about how that rolls through access points and routers and other end user applications for the most part, so I think those are important. And then the filtering that we discussed, we'll continue to add to our portfolio filters, stretch the frequencies a bit, improve the yields within our factories, and try to grow that through a number of customers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. In your mobile products division, what areas do you think offer the most \u2013 what types of products offer the most opportunity for content increases in handsets? And where are you investing to build products?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, yeah. What we're seeing, again, is the mid-tier players that want to grow into high global Tier 1s or global Tier 2 brands. Huawei was a great example. Names like Oppo and Vivo are great examples. We're seeing companies like Samsung that have a great high-end portfolio, still hundreds of millions of phones that are in mid-tier that were moving up. And so the way that we're doing it is really to provide enhancements in our transmit chain solutions, which would be our SkyOne product line, trying to give them more output power and create a more efficient solution.", "We're working hard with our DRx solutions, which have been adopted by some strategic customers that have realized great benefit in improving downlink performance. That technology has not been fully populated so there's quite a bit of opportunity for us to go out and submit new wins there. And then you look at some technologies like Wi-Fi and power management, we have great product and our adoption rate has not been substantial through certain markets and is growing. So we're seeing more and more Wi-Fi now embedded in smartphones throughout Asia, the U.S. has been pretty solid. And we're starting to see just some more advancements in our power portfolio. So all of that is coming together. We look at a name like Huawei, on the Mate 10 phone, where we have $9 or more of content. That's kind of the benchmark that we'd want to see across the entire mobile space.", "David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, everyone. Appreciate you participating on today's call. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences and other events during the quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

LLC", "Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Operator", "Good afternoon, and welcome to Skyworks Solutions' First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.", "Mitchell J. Haws - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Skyworks' First Fiscal Quarter 2018 Conference Call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or may be considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with our past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP.", "With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team produced record results in Q1, demonstrating our traction within the increasingly vibrant and profitable mobile and IoT ecosystems. During the quarter, we exceeded $1 billion in revenue and delivered $2 in earnings per share, driven by strong global demand for our high performance connectivity solutions. Let me begin with a few Q1 highlights. We generated revenue of $1.05 billion, up 15% year-over-year. We expanded gross margins to 51.4% and operating margin to 39.4%. We achieved records earnings per share, up 24% year-over-year, and $0.09 ahead of consensus.", "And finally, we exceeded our free cash flow margin goal of 30%. In addition to our strong financial performance, we continue expanding our design-win pipeline. Our systems solutions are enabling everything, from industrial robotics to drones, autonomous vehicles, wireless infrastructure, home security, and virtual assistance. Last quarter, we broadened our reach across a number of leading mobile and IoT customers. In mobile, we secured strategic design wins, leveraging our fully-integrated solutions, including SkyOne, SkyBlue, as well as DRx, power management, and precision antenna tuning.", "Across broad markets, we enabled telematics in support of a leading automobile manufacturer; delivered LTE capabilities within Amazon's newest Kindle and Alexa-based platforms; deployed connectivity engines for Google's new Home Max wireless speakers; developed feature-rich ZigBee and Bluetooth modules for Nest's new connected home alarm systems; secured multi-user MIMO design wins at Linksys, tripling home data rates; supported Netgear's Orbi Wi-Fi system for outdoor mesh networks; we partnered with Comcast on their premium high-performance XB6 home gateway; and finally, in our infrastructure markets, we secured a number of massive MIMO wins with carriers across Europe and China.", "So to summarize, we delivered record financial results, captured strategic design wins across all key markets, and substantially strengthened our balance sheet. At a higher level, the ubiquitous connected economy is gaining significant momentum and enhancing the way we live, work and educate. The Skyworks' vision of connecting everyone and everything all the time is more relevant than ever. This vision is the catalyst behind our recently launched Sky5 platform. Our Sky5 solutions address new 5G spectrum, enhanced carrier aggregation, dual connectivity, and massive MIMO requirements, while delivering unmatched levels of integration and performance.", "The deployment of our Sky5 platform accelerates our mission to enable the data-driven world, while alleviating the digital traffic jam created in current 4G networks. 5G is critical to resolving this challenge, opening entirely new lanes of spectrum. 5G will represent a significant boost in speed, up to 100 times that of 4G networks. 5G will offer extremely low latency, a requirement for mission-critical applications such as the driverless car, machine-to-machine, and robotics. 5G will also be a major catalyst to the expansive rollout of IoT, greatly expanding network capacity and improving reliability.", "As a leader in unwiring the planet, Skyworks is well positioned with extensive technology depth and breadth, strategic partnerships with all leading smartphone and IoT customers, differentiated system solutions enabling unmatched levels of integration and performance, all of which is underpinned by the formidable investments we've made over the past two decades, expanding our product portfolio, IP, and scale. As a result, we have the profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet to extend our leadership position. Our strategic R&D and CapEx investments will be pivotal as the scale and technology requirements around 5G intensify. Finally, and most importantly, we are committed to delivering premium levels of profitability with above-market growth as we continue to create shareholder value.", "I will now turn the call over to Kris for discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q2.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Liam. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 was a record $1.052 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 15% compared to Q1 of last year, exceeding our guidance and consensus estimates. Gross profit was $541 million or 51.4% of revenue, up 40 basis points sequentially following 30 basis points of sequential improvement in both the September and June quarters of 2017.", "Our record gross margin of 51.4% in Q1 was up 20 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $127 million, or 12% of revenue. As a result, we generated $414 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 39.4%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points year-over-year. This drove record net income of $372 million or $2 of earnings per share, up 24% year-over year, and exceeding our guidance by $0.09.", "Before turning to the balance sheet review, let me summarize the impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. In general, the tax implications are positive for Skyworks. Due to the fact that we are on a fiscal calendar ending in September, the financial impact will be phased in over fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. Based on currently available information and interpretations of the new tax law, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 11% for fiscal 2018, down from prior estimates of 14.5%.", "In fiscal 2019, the non-GAAP effective rate could potentially drop further to about 10%. This will generate substantial tax savings, benefit our cash flow, and provide increased access to our international cash. In Q1 of fiscal 2018, we booked in our GAAP results a one-time charge of $258 million related to tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and a non-cash charge of $18 million related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The repatriation tax will be paid over the next eight years, more weighted towards the last three years. Those charges were excluded from the non-GAAP results and are provisional amounts that may change as we refine our analysis.", "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First, fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $361 million and capital expenditures were $28 million, resulting in a free cash flow margin of 31.6%. Dividends paid were $59 million, and we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for a total of $173 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion and no debt. As noted in a separate press release issued today, the Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. This new program reflects the board and management team's confidence in Skyworks' business model.", "When coupled with the added flexibility of the recently passed tax legislation, our strong free cash flow generation allows us to leverage stock repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures to drive higher shareholder returns and investment for future growth. As a result, we are increasing our targeted cash return rate to shareholders from the 40% to 50% range historically to a level of 60% to 75% of free cash flow going forward.", "Now, let's review our outlook for fiscal Q2. We anticipate revenue to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year, with gross margin at 50.5% to 51%, and operating expenses of $131 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $2 million in other income, and a tax rate of 11%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 185 million shares. Accordingly at the midpoint of approximately $910 million in revenue, we plan to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.60, a 10% increase year-over-year. Based on our expanding reach within flagship platforms, and with design win momentum across broad markets, we expect accelerated top-line growth and further margin improvements throughout the balance of the fiscal and calendar year.", "With that, let me turn the call back to Liam.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks, Kris. Skyworks enters 2018 with strong momentum. Our outperformance is being driven by a vibrant, dynamic mobile ecosystem, one that rewards companies who can resolve architectural complexity with simplified integrated solutions. The value inherent in a connected economy is apparent in our results. Over the past 5 years, our revenues have more than doubled, EPS has more than tripled, and our operating cash flow was up 5 times. Our strong cash generation is allowing us the flexibility to continue to invest to win, while substantially increasing our targeted cash return to shareholders.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "First question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.", "Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Thank you guys for taking my questions. I guess, Kris you mentioned that obviously you're guiding for 6% to 8% for calendar Q1, and you said you expect an acceleration going forward. Just curious as to what's driving that acceleration in top line growth for the next few quarters.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, this is Liam. Yeah, I mean, if you look at the business today, we posted $1.050 billion in Q1 with a solid design win signature. That design win signature carries into Q2, albeit some of the units here with some significant flagship accounts were lower. As you start to move into the second half, there's a new set of products and a new set of design wins that we've consummated that will accelerate our business in the second half. So it's really some unique technologies that we brought forth to some leading customers and there's some broad market activity. But the second half is actually quite visible to us right now based on known design wins and then the continued run rate on some of our broad markets business.", "Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. Great. Just to follow up on that, Liam. Do you still believe that this RF business is a 10% to 15% growth business in, I guess, calendar 2018? And also as you look out to 2019 and 2020, when do you think 5G will start to contribute materially?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Yeah. We do think that it's a 10% to 15% opportunity and we're pursuing that with vigor and success quite frankly. And if you look out into 5G, we'll start to see early indications of 5G in the 2019 platforms, and more so in 2020. And as we've articulated in the past what you're going to see which is great for the industry is the 5G platform. Our Sky5 will be an addendum to the 4G engine. So you're going to see new technologies, new frequency bands, new devices addressing the 5G spectrum in addition to having backward compatibility to 4G and even some 3G.", "Operator", "Before we go to the next question, given time constraints, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We'll go to the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe Liam, if you could walk us through March, obviously lots of guys in handsets have seen some weakness into the March quarter. Maybe you could just walk through the moving pieces for you in March. And then there was some concerns that maybe there's some customer inventory. I'm just kind of curious your visibility into the customer channel, and whether you had any thoughts on June whether this could be the bottom.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Yeah, I mean, as I just mentioned, the design win signature, specifically with the premium flagship models, had been cemented in the December quarter, and imputed in our $1.050 billion. And so what you've got in the March quarter are fewer units for the flagship, which weighed on us. And to some degree we were able to offset that naturally though growth in broad markets which is up year-over-year in March. And also China hasn't been great, but it actually be modestly up for us again in March. So our March quarter, a little bit of recovery in China, broad market steady, taking some weakness from flagship customers, and all that nets out into our guidance.", "Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got you. And then maybe just one more question on just the guidance for March between broad markets and the mobile business. So I'm just curious, broad markets has been growing quite nicely high teens. Trying to still figure out the seasonality there. I'm just kind of curious into March whether you expect broad markets to be up or down.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, it will be up in the March quarter Blayne, and it continues, we think. I know you mentioned something about June, June should be okay there as well for broad.", "Operator", "Question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the good execution. Liam, you mentioned some new wins in the second half. Is that more shared in existing sockets, such as low-band PAD, or in addition to that is it more content, and in what kind of applications could that be?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, I mean, it's both. It's certainly \u2013 one of the things to remember is that the portfolio that we provide evolves year-over-year. It's been happening forever. There really hasn't been any stagnation there. So we are seeing an increasing demand and burden on the technology. There's been performance driven solutions that require really creative elegant differentiated product. It's great for us. It allows us to really kind of flex our muscles in technology, leveraging our Tc-SAW capability, our in-house gallium arsenide, our switching, our packaging in Mexicali, all of that. So we're seeing share gains in an evolving set of products that maybe two or three generations ago have grown up to be more and more rich in content, richer in value. And then we're also expanding into new areas completely. So we're doing more things in antenna tuning. We're expanding in GPS. We're starting to develop higher band solutions in some cases with customers. So it's really all of the above that will put us in great position for the second half.", "Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. And as my follow-up, how sensitive is your pipeline to the supplier of the baseband modem? So, for example, if, let's say, Intel happens to win a lot more share of some of these flagship models from the current incumbent, does that change your content in any way?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "No, that's a great question. And it does not actually. We have great position with both Intel and Qualcomm. And if you go into Asia, you'll see us lined up with HiSilicon at Huawei. You'll see us lined up with MediaTek. So we're able to work with all of the above. And again, we have real diversity there with our partnerships. And certainly, there's going to be some companies that do better on the baseband side, and we're right along on track with that.", "Operator", "We have a question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to the capital allocation and just wanted to understand, A, the timing, and B, the components to that. So, clearly, you guys have a very analogist model in terms of the free cash you generate. So, was this catalyzed by the tax reform that you're raising your capital return? And then within that, what's the right way to think about the mix between buyback and dividend? And then I had a quick follow-up, please.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, we will continue to evaluate our capital return, but very pleased to announce a $1 billion new share buyback authorization today. In part, of course, that was triggered by the fact that our cash, roughly $1 billion of the $1.7 billion of cash, which was offshore, now becomes available, and we can repatriate that without any further tax consequences and use that for dividend payments and share buyback. It's something, again, we will continue to evaluate, the right mix between dividends and share buybacks, but a combination of both, we target now 60% to 75% of the free cash flow.", "Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, maybe, Kris, you can answer this one as well. Just going back to the last earnings call when I had asked you actually about your CapEx, you had indicated that you are raising your capacity, and then also, as one of the drivers for gross margin, you have talked about increasing the mix between internal versus external. So the increase in capacity, and I just want to understand the dynamics between the two, are you raising capacity because you have some new design wins that are expected to fill that capacity and then help you progress on that path that you talked about increasing internal versus external?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, absolutely. There is some seasonality to the CapEx as well, and the December quarter is typically our low CapEx quarter. We are going to increase CapEx in the second quarter, the March quarter and the June quarter as we get ready for the ramp-up in the second half of the fiscal or calendar year. This is both related to capacity extensions as well as technology investments that we make along the line there.", "And so, in terms of insourcing our filter operation, we continue to make good progress there towards a 75% insource. We're not all the way done with that, so there is still some progression left there, and the teams are working hard on it and putting that in place.", "Operator", "We have a question from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Joseph Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC", "Hi, guys. Nice job in a tough environment. Liam, can you maybe talk about what you're seeing on the competitive front, either SAW performing as well as BAW, and if Qualcomm 360 is making any inroads? Then, Kris, if you wouldn't mind, give us kind of a view on total CapEx for 2018.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, I'll start with the competitive landscape. I mean, certainly, what we see in the market today is our customers are facing an incredible opportunity in bringing higher-speed connectivity to the market and moving into 5G. But it's also a more burdensome challenge for them. So they're selecting suppliers that can do more and suppliers that can resolve this challenge. There's so much interference and crowded spectrum and work to be done to make these great products actually execute and perform in the market. So what's been beneficial for us, Tony, is to have the building blocks, have the capability to do very high-performance Tc-SAW stretching all the way to 2.5 gigahertz, covering a lot of spectrum, the ability to bring our crafted gallium arsenide, our assembly and test unique architectures, and filters of any nature to bring that solution. And the configurability that we offer account-by-account has been quite important. So that's something that I don't see across the peer group, it's something that we've been rewarded with. And as Kris mentioned early, we're making the investments. We're investing offensively in our technologies to ensure that we can take care of what's on the table today, and also be with our customers as we move into 5G.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. So CapEx will be running on or about 10%, might be even slightly above that. But on or about 10% as we prepare for the ramp in the second half.", "Anthony Joseph Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC", "Great job, guys. Thank you.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "(23:41) from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks. Liam, just a follow up. You commented on the broad markets in terms of visibility going out into the June quarter up. Any commentary on just mobile, in terms of what you're seeing from the supply chain, and how sequentially you would view the June quarter?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, Craig. Yeah. So we're going through a March quarter where mobile has been a bit challenged on a unit basis more so I would say. As we get into June, we don't have all of our signals completely aligned on June, but I certainly expect it to be up for the company in total. Broad markets will play a role in that, and I think mobile should also be okay in June, probably up a bit.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then just as a follow up on broad markets, if I look at call it 17%, 18% year-over-year growth in recent quarters, and then in the context of that business grows maybe 10%, 15% longer term, just kind of some of the drivers near term, and just do you think you can continue to sustain at these higher growth rates.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. We do think we can sustain. There's just so many more customers and opportunities that we haven't addressed in that space. And mobile is a great business for us. We see tremendous growth in that market. We know where the dollars are, and we've been very efficient at pursuing those. In broad markets, we're growing mid-teens, but there's a lot of opportunity that we haven't addressed. We continue to pursue it. I'm very pleased with the portfolio that we offer from Wi-Fi to ZigBee to Bluetooth. We're starting to see 11ax (25:14) technologies rolled out in some of these advanced access points in routers. We've mentioned some of the applications in the prepared remarks. Automotive is becoming more and more critical for us, leveraging LTE modules, and will certainly be a driver in the 5G. So the fact that we have this very, very broad spectrum of connectivity solutions really lends itself well to the diverse applications that we see across broad markets. So that's one of the important parts. And there's so much blue sky there that we really should expect to be growing mid-teens for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "We have a question from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, we are not making any changes to our target model. But we're making very good progress towards that target model, which is again growing the top line above market, and we have been making good progress there. We have a gross margin target of 53%, again, three quarter in a row, good progress, good improvements there, 30 basis point in June, 30 basis point in September, 40 basis points in December. Obviously, in March, on a softer revenue margin is coming down a little bit, but we expect to make further good progress in the following quarters. And so we target a 40% operating margins, and we are really close to that in the December quarter, and expect to get there soon in one of the following quarters there. And in addition to that, of course, we focus on free cash flow. The target there is a free cash flow margin of 30%. We beat that number actually in the December quarter. But on a full-year basis, we target 30% free cash flow.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Well, we're still working on a number of technologies and solutions to drive higher frequencies and to address 5G. And that's what our Sky5 platform is going to do. And the filtering technology, we have the opportunity to pursue just about every type of filter that we would need. Some of those will be in-house, some will be through partnerships.", "Operator", "We have a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yes, thank you. Just to start. Could you provide the split between broad markets and mobile in December quarter? And I think you said you're expecting the broad markets to increase sequentially into the March quarter.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. So obviously the December quarter was a strong mobile quarter, especially driven by some new platform ramps with our largest customer. That played out as expected. And so as a result of that, mobile was slightly above the 75%, and broad market was slightly below 25%. As Liam pointed out, in the next couple of quarters we expect to continue to see some strong sequential as well as year-over-year growth in broad market. And so on a full-year basis that is going to flip again, and so you can think about roughly 75% mobile, 25% broad market.", "Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow up, with respect to the revised cash return policy, is there anything to read through there with respect to your appetite or your view towards further M&A? Liam, I think you've said in the past, you're pretty happy with your business as it is, you'd be amenable to looking at things they came along, but perhaps in light of this new strategy you could update us on your current thinking.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure, Chris. Well, as you said, we have a discerning view on M&A, certainly if the right opportunity presents itself we're in great position to execute. Our cash balance is strong. Our free cash flow margin is strong. We've got some great attributes in our business model that provides powder. So we're not taking that off the table, but again, we still want to be sure that shareholders understand that the capital allocation that we outlined today is aggressive, but we have 100% capability to deliver that. We announced the $1 billion buyback as well. So there's a lot of good things happening on that end. But M&A is always something that we look at. But day-to-day we're driving this business, and we like the opportunities in front of us.", "Operator", "We have a question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray", "Yeah. Hey, guys, first of all congratulations. Solid execution in what's a tough environment. And Liam, I had a question for you. Every company that's reported has talked about China being tough. I think you mentioned, correct me if I'm wrong, that China would be up modestly for you guys in March. I'm curious what's driving that. And then also, is the Korean customer ramp, or their flagship phone playing a role for you guys in the March quarter?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, sure. So I would say that the Korean customer is up in March. China is just about flat to up a bit. And China had been a faster grower for us in the middle of the year, cooled off a bit in Q1, and right now going into Q2, we've got them roughly flattish. We have the Korean customer up year-over-year in March quarter.", "Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray", "Got it. And then for my follow up, your incremental fall through at this point in time, and then how do you see that changing as you bring more of the filters in-house as the year progresses?", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. No. That is an ongoing effort, Harsh. And so in part of course driven by the ramp of the new platforms that consume more and more complex filters, and so the team is executing very well on that. And so it's just a matter of couple quarters and we'll get to that 75%.", "Operator", "We have a question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I think this may be a follow up to a point that Kris made earlier, but I just wanted to make sure I understood it clearly. So what I wanted to do is focus on the full-year growth potential of each of the two main businesses. We clearly have a strong start to the calendar year in broad markets. You're expecting integrated mobile to come back very strongly in the back half of the year. So for the calendar year, Liam and Kris, which of those businesses is going to be the better grower? Is it integrated mobile, given the strength of the second half ramps, or is it broad market, just given the stronger start to the year and growth through the year?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Sure. Yeah, I'll try to give you a little color on really what we can glean today. I will tell you that the second half of the calendar and more so even the fiscal and calendar both, you're going to see accelerating gains in mobile. We have some really powerful design wins that have been cemented. And it's just a matter of time for those to actually make it into our P&L. So that we know. Broad markets, we see a steady path to mid-teens. So I think if you've modeled that and that level kind of a 15%-ish kind of number through the balance of the year, that's kind of where we see it. And there's a lot of diversification in broad markets. We tend not to see the kind of seasonality that we do see in mobile. And there's a very broad design win footprint across those customers.", "So mobile is definitely going to be stronger in the back half of the year with known design wins, broad market with our current business and growing opportunities we see as a mid-teen grower.", "Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.", "That's really helpful. And then the follow-up is really putting calendar 2018 in perspective and looking longer term. It seems like every indication that we get for 5G is more and more optimistic that we're going to have devices ramping in the first half of the year more materially in the back half of the year. And that really kicks off an era where content is going to go up very significantly it seems given the 10x increase in band combination.", "So, is calendar 2018 really a bit of a pause in the integrated mobile business even though we're getting very good year-on-year growth now and stronger in the second half relative to what we could see next year? How do you look at the growth rate that we have this year relative to what you could see coming over the next two to three?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. No, that's a great question. It's certainly our belief that 5G will be yet another catalyst in mobility, and it's clearly it's necessary as for all the reasons that we talked about in the prepared remarks, and you've heard it in our Sky5 presentation. So we know what that needs to happen. We're going to play a pivotal role. We're working with the right thought leaders and customers that are shaping the architectures. We're very much aligned. So we're looking forward to that.", "But I still think that what we're seeing in today's model, there's great stuff here, there's great content. And the units are down a little bit, but in the second half, I think we're going to see some catch up, and then going into 2019 and beyond, you're going to start to see 5G become more and more apparent in architectures, and it will be a steady roll over several years before we get the whole market to upgrade.", "Operator", "We have a question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "Thanks a lot. Good work on just every metric here, and I know you've been guiding for improving gross margins. Liam, if you walk us through real quick what the three primary factors you see in the next 12 months, 24 months that will drive gross margins. I know utilization factor (35:35) is one of those. But maybe you could identify those, if you could. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. (35:42) I'll take that. So, obviously, our gross margin drivers haven't changed, and the first one, of course, is incremental revenue and revenue growth that gives us better utilization and fixed cost absorption. That is one. Second, it's ongoing operational efficiencies that we drive in all our fabs, the front-end fabs, the filter fabs as well as our back-end operation.", "And then last but not least, we've talked about that, it's the ongoing filter insourcing where we make some good progress bringing those filters in-house at a much lower cost than we buy them from third parties, while at the same time, of course, improving the performance of those filters as well. And that are the three levers, and that will continue to drive further margin improvement towards our target model of 53%.", "Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research", "So, I guess, the follow up on that one, if I could, Kris is, I mean, you're already gargantuan in Tc-SAW. Your scale, I think, towards your second closest competitor to the point where they just gave \u2013 I won't say gave up on it, but certainly rather than keep investing trying to catch you, have kind of relinquished that. You've got the largest packaging assembly test facility, I guess, on earth at this point, in Mexicali. So how much \u2013 I mean, a couple of those were about scale, and you've already got monster scale. So it would seem like those gains are going to be relatively limited even if you make your targets.", "And then, Liam, if I could real quick, you spoke several times about how solving complexity is one of the keys to gaining share in new content and new slots at some of your largest mobile customers, that seems to be the case. Can you give us a characterization, real something you'll sketch out about (37:21) well, how you see the world because there's been a lot of chatter from everybody from Qualcomm, from the Japanese, and few other guys about filter technologies or new wins or whatever, but the trend seems to be definitely in your camp here on these more complicated modules. Is it amps, is it filters, is it system design? Why are they apparently losing share and you guys are gaining it? Thanks.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. No, that's a great question. And I'm going to dovetail back a bit into the margin element too. I mean, one of the other really critical pieces of the margin fabric is really our integration technology, just as you outlined. So, the complexity and the challenge in mobility requires suppliers to act differently and find opportunities to really help the customer. If we don't help our customer win, no one's going to win. So we do a lot of work on building these crafted integrated solutions. We started with SkyOne. It took a while for that to get airspeed, but it's become our dominant transmit change solution that goes from low-band to mid-band to high-band. We've dovetailed that with resolving another problem on the receive chain, developing our DRx solution, again, leveraging our filters, leveraging L&A technology, and the unique craftsmanship that we can deliver through Mexicali. So we see that continue. That creates also a margin opportunity because it presents tremendous value to the customer, and it creates a lot of competitive barriers with our peers. That's been helpful. As we start to move out along the curve into higher frequency and into the domain of 5G, the landscape gets even more difficult and more challenging. Fewer companies can put these pieces together. So our ability to go from crafted gallium arsenide, partnerships in SOI, filter technology, in-housing growing, and then that ability to configure with our own assembly and test, all of that is really unique. Figure out how to work with every base-band supplier, we do that. We get with the best and the brightest and it comes together. It's not easy, but that's the recipe that's been working for us.", "Operator", "We have a question from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC", "Hi, guys. Congratulations on the nice results. Liam, your largest competitor in low-band PADs has admitted it's likely to lose share in the second half of 2018 as these new flagship phones ramp in the second half. Do you expect to pick up that share or do you see a more competitive market in low-band PADs? And then I've got a follow-up.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Well, yeah, barring any specific customers, we see a robust market share position for low-band PAD. We also see that product really growing and its reach of technology, expanding bands, for example, and delivering higher performance output power to milliamp level performance. So that continues to be an increasingly important product for the industry. We expect to populate that through a number of Tier 1 large scale players.", "Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC", "And then a follow up is just, as you look at the premiere flagship phones being announced in 2018, do you expect a significant percentage of those phones to have gigabit modems that require 4x4 receive chains?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "4x4 is increasing. Right now we're in early innings and stepping through that increased performance. We're seeing it with some of the high-performance flagship models. So it's starting to become apparent on kind of the roadmaps for the mid-tier customers, but it's another opportunity. I mean, it greatly expands the RF content for all players. But to the point of integration that we talked about in the last few questions, bringing those solutions together kind of in an intricate size reduced manner that allows the greatest performance without degradation of signal I think is key. So 4x4 isn't just simply putting in more and more radios. It's really about architecting them so that they work in unison at a higher level.", "Operator", "Final question is from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the low-band PAD question. So I guess, Liam, how do you expect your mix to look over the next few quarters, low-band versus mid and high? And then, Kris, I guess, if we see an increasing mix of low-band, does that have any implications on your gross margin outlook?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, I mean, the low-band PAD is not a new product for us, but we are again raising the performance level each and every year. So what would be launching and being delivered in the second half of 2018 is very different than what you'd see in 2017 or 2016. And it's a product that we see extended reach, as I mentioned. We see this going across multiple customers. There are few critical ones where it's going to be more of a driver. But for our business right now, it's one of our most important architectures. We're delivering now also mid band and high band solutions. If you flip it to the receive side, DRx is kind of following the same chain where we started with a low-band DRx, we're moving to mid and high there. So you've got both sides. You've got transmit and then you have receive side that will benefit from some of these newer architectures. And of course low-band PAD has been mentioned a few times, and that's going to be a key product for us as always.", "Kris Sennesael - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah. And the low-band PAD is running on or about company average from a gross margin point of view. So it's not a headwind or a tailwind.", "Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Okay. Great. And then to my follow up. So last week, Qorvo made some pretty specific comments about their expectation to retake some share at Samsung and Huawei, kind of post this spring portfolio ramp. Sounds like you're pretty confident in the back half of your position as well. Can you maybe help square your confidence versus their comments?", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Yeah, listen, I look at our outlook and the design wins that I know that we've consummated. We feel really good about the second half. We feel really good. I mean, there's going to be competition. This is a growing market that we play in, and there's opportunities for others. But we feel very confident in what we've won, and a lot of that technology, you're going to start to see here in the second half calendar and fiscal.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Griffin for any closing comments.", "Liam K. Griffin - Skyworks Solutions, Inc.", "Well, thank you all for participating on today's call.
