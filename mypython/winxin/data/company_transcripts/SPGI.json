Thank you for joining us for S&P Global's Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we'll provide an adjusted financial information.

We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors. And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at (212) 438-1247.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Doug Peterson", "Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call. I'd also like welcome our new CFO Ewout Steenbergen. Ewout joined us in November and is participating in his first earnings conference call with us. You'll hear more from him shortly.", "2016 was a memorable year with market uncertainty surrounding pivotable outcomes from Brexit, the US election and the long-awaited increase in US interest rate. Despite this uncertainty, spreads tightened, issuance was strong, equity markets ended up the year and S&P Global delivered another solid performance.", "Let me begin with 2016 highlights. We finished the year with strong fourth quarter results. We delivered another year of impressive financial performance with mid single-digit revenue growth and mid teen\u2019s adjusted EPS growth.", "We re-branded the company's S&P Global with the new ticker SPGI. We reshape the portfolio with a number of divestitures and acquisitions. The most significant divestiture being J.D. Power.", "We successfully completed our 2014 to 2016 $140 million cost reduction initiative. We made substantial progress on our SNL integration synergy. We generated nearly $1.5 billion in free cash flow and we returned $1.5 billion through share repurchases and dividends.", "We also delivered excellent financial results. The company reported 7% revenue growth of this growth 89% was pull-through to adjusted operating profit. This is a direct result of our continued focus on productivity.", "On an organic basis, revenue grew 6% and the pull-through to adjusted operating profit was also high. These achievements led to a 300 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin, and continued a string of annual improvements in adjusted operating profit margin of more than 275 basis points for the third year in a row.", "While ForEx had a $24 million unfavorable impact on revenue, it had a $43 million favorable impact on adjusted operating margin - operating profit with market intelligence realizing the majority of the game.", "I'm very pleased that we were able to leverage 7% revenue growth into 14% adjusted EPS growth through a combination of productivity improvement and share repurchase activity.", "2016 was not an isolated year. Our revenue growth was consistent with the 7% annual growth over the past four years and our 300 basis point margin improvement capped 1000 basis points of margin improvement over the past four years. Our focus on growth and performance has material changed the earnings power of the company.", "This earnings powers translated into a substantial increase in adjusted earnings per share. In 2016 we almost doubled our 2012 EPS, delivering 18% compounded annual growth rate over the last four years.", "During 2016, we continue to add capabilities and reshape S&P Global. In Platts, we are building a world-class supply demand capability. With FinTech and Eclipse [ph] already in place providing US and European natural gas analytics, we purchased PIRA Energy Group, RigData and Commodity Flow, adding a wealth of expertise in global energy market analysis, US rig activity and waterborne analytics.", "With our deep history of providing benchmark commodity prices, we believe providing the supply demand analytics around these prices will be a great value to our customers.", "S&P Dow Jones Indices purchased Trucost, a leader in carbon and environmental data and risk analysis. Not only will this acquisition enable the creation of unique new indices, but our rating business will leverage Trucost capabilities, and new creation, new ESG products, such as green bond evaluation.", "Ratings added to its international capabilities with the acquisition of a 49% stake in TRIS highlight [ph] including credit rating agency. Thailand is Asean's second-largest economy and third-largest bond market.", "We reshaped our portfolio with the divestitures of J.D. Power, our pricing businesses, and our equity and fund research business and Quant House [ph] in January 2017. These result moves left us with a stronger, more cohesive set of businesses.", "Now I want to turn to our outlook for 2017 and discuss key scenes that are shaping 2017 and beyond. These are topics I discussed with our board, as well as the division president as we look to the next year and the next 3 to 5 years. We look forward to discussing these themes with you this quarter and during the year.", "Global GDP though increasing this year is running much lower than the past. Interest rates that have been declining since 1981 could continue to rise. Geopolitical considerations like Brexit, populist changes to government and threats to established trade deals create new risks.", "Regulations become an unparalleled force for change. We count 22 ratings regulators worldwide today with the majority less than five years old. All of you have witnessed the rise of compliance within your own firm. Our customers have changing expectations, are feeling competitive pressures and facing changing business model.", "Technology continues to disrupt every industry, including ours. According to Citibank, there's been a tenfold increase in FinTech companies in the past five years. It took 75 years for the telephone to reach 50 million users, radio 38 years, TV 13, Internet 4 years and Pokemon Go 19 days.", "Sustainability is becoming ubiquitous among companies and investors, climate change conferences, ESG investable funds point to significant changes in behavior. We need to stay ahead of these trends and create products that address the changing needs of our clients and markets, things like green bond evaluation, ESG Indices, new credit tool and new product platforms or opportunities that we are pursuing.", "Our economists expect global GDP to grow 3.5% in 2017. The chart depicts their view for the next two years in which all world areas except Europe will experience accelerated GDP growth.", "In the US low unemployment and increased consumer spending will underpin GDP growth. In Europe, recovery is on track and showing resilience, but not enough to boost GDP.", "In Asia, we expect reasonable growth and little inflation with India being a bright spot. And in Latin America, we expect improvement driven by continued recovery in commodity prices and stabilizing domestic command.", "Last week ratings issued its annual global refinancing study, this yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming five years. The chart on the left illustrates data from the 2016 and 2017 studies. The five-year period in the 2017 study shows a $100 billion increase in total debt maturing versus the 2016study.", "We use this study along with other market-based data to forecast issuance.", "Taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high-yield maturity. Over the next five years, the level of high-yield debt maturing significantly increases each year, which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years.", "Last week ratings also publish their latest issuance forecast. Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 3%, positive global trends for issuance include the European Central Bank's quantitative easing program, continued strong issuance out of China and expectations for slightly stronger GDP growth in the US. Global issuance is still likely, however to face headwinds from global political uncertainty and a continued evaluation of most currencies relative to the US dollar.", "One item that seems very clear is that interest rates will continue to rise in the US. Rising rates have been an investor concern for several years now as the belief is that rising rates will impair debt issuance. Our fixed come analytical team \u2013 our fixed income analytical team has explored this topic and published report called recent policy proposal potential impact on US corporate bond issuance. You can see it on RatingsDirect.", "This charges US corporate issuance in GDP since 1996. Both GDP and issuance increased over the period. We find a statistically significant relationship between US corporate issuance and GDP.", "This next chart shows US corporate issuance and the 10 year treasury yield since 1996. Our statisticians ran a number of tests, including the Granger causality test, a statistical test used to determine whether one time series is useful in forecasting another time series. Their conclusion was there is a weak negative correlation between interest rates in issuance.", "We've seen a number of tax proposals since the recent election and we've been studying them, people from our tax, finance, economics and public policy team have been evaluating potential changes. The proposals remain in a state of flux and it\u2019s difficult to draw definitive conclusion.", "Nevertheless, I want to review our current thinking on the most commonly discussed potential tax changes. First, on a lower corporate tax rate, as the company with a relatively high tax rate, this would be very positive for the company.", "On repatriation, a one-time repatriation of that would likely reduce issuance, but would be unlikely to have major impact on long-term capital structure. In addition, much of the cash held overseas is by large technology companies like Apple and Oracle that have very little debt.", "For our company specifically, we would reevaluate our investment strategies and that could lead to repatriating much our overseas cash. We believe that the removal interest expense deduction could reduce the attractiveness of debt, particularly for high yield issuers and likely reduce issuance.", "However, lower tax rates would provide greater borrowing capacity for companies, which could be positive. As for S&P Global, this would be a negative as we currently at $3.6 billion of long-term debt.", "The removal of the municipal bond tax exemption would reduce the attractiveness in muni bonds to investors requiring alternative funding of local projects. Therefore, it likely hurt municipal bond issuance, but infrastructure issuance could potentially increase to partially offset this. Order adjustment could benefit our companies in next export. Please note our 2017 guidance does not consider any of these potential tax law changes.", "Let me finish by sharing some of the most important initiative in 2017. As always, delivering financial performance is at the top of the list. We are introducing organic revenue guidance of mid-single-digit growth, adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $5.90 to $6.15 and free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.6 billion. Ewout will provide more color to the guidance in a moment.", "Throughout the company, I'm stressing the need to build excellent into all that we do, to be competitive, nothing less is acceptable. Some of the more visible areas includes, launching a beta version of the new market intelligence platform in the fall, leveraging recent acquisitions create world-class supply demand analytics for Platts customers, continuing index innovation and international partnerships and advancing ratings commercial discipline, analytical quality and IT driven productivity.", "We continue to track and execute on our SNL synergy program and fund additional productivity initiatives and process improvement and we remain committed to compliance control and risk management across the company. We're pleased with our progress, but we're working to make this company even better.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Ewout. Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thank you, Doug. And good morning to everyone on the call. This morning I would like to discuss the fourth quarter results and then provide guidance for 2017.", "Let's starts with the consolidated fourth quarter income statement. Reported revenue increased 2%. However, organic revenue increased a 11%. This was the strongest quarterly organic revenue growth of the year.", "Adjusted operating profit increased 17% and adjusted operating margin increased 530 basis points. The adjusted operating margin improved, primarily due to revenue growth, continued progress on productivity initiatives and the sale of lower margin businesses.", "The adjusted effective tax rate increased 500 basis points, primarily because the fourth quarter 2015 tax rate was unusually low largely due to favorable tax benefits from the resolution of prior yield tax audits.", "In addition, the fourth quarter 2016 rate included the impact from dividends we received from foreign subsidiaries and a slight increase in the US state income tax rate.", "Adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% and we decreased our average diluted shares outstanding by 4%. Both our fourth quarter and full-year results were impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates.", "In the fourth quarter of 2016 the two main impacts were a $2 million unfavorable impact on the ratings, adjusted operating profit, primarily due to the weaker British pound and a $9 million favorable impact in markets and commodities intelligence adjusted operating profit, primarily due to the weaker British pound and a weaker Indian rupee.", "Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $272 million in the quarter and included a $347 million net gain on recent divestitures, predominantly from the sale of the rising businesses and this also includes a $31 million expense associated with disposition of Quant House, a 54 million expense associated with an increase in financial crisis, legal reserves and a $21 million expense related to the early retirement of our 2017 debt.", "In the fourth quarter every business segment contributed to gains in organic revenue and adjusted operating profit, while this line shows an 11% decline in reported revenue at market and commodities intelligence. Excluding the impact of asset sales, organic revenue increased to 8%.", "Adjusted operating margins improved significantly in ratings and market and commodities intelligence, but declined in S&P Dow Jones Indices. I will discuss these changes within each segment discussion.", "Let me now turn to the individual segments performance. Ratings had a strong quarter, leading the company in both revenue and operating profit growth. Revenue increased 14%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx.", "Considering normal seasonality in the fourth quarter US-bond issuance was robust, despite US selection uncertainty, which only constrained bond market activity for a few days.", "Adjusted operating margin increased 360 basis points due to strong revenue growth, reduced legal and outside services spending, partially offset by increased incentives. While not shown on the slide, full-year adjusted operating profit margin reached 49.8%, an increase of 240 basis points aided by a modest boost from ForEx.", "Strong transaction revenue underscores ratings fourth quarter revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased 5% from growth in surveillance fees, increased inter-segment royalty's for market intelligence, and growth at CRISIL.", "Transaction revenue increased 26%, as a result of improved contract terms, growth in structure, US public finance and corporate issuance, as well as increased bank loan ratings.", "This slide is a new quarterly disclosure that illustrates ratings revenue by its various markets. First, note the corporate and financial make up the majority of revenue. Second, US public finance is the largest component of government. In the fourth quarter there were broad gains in every market with the exception of financials, which was negatively impacted by concerns about US election and an interest rate increase.", "If you look more closely at the largest markets, fourth quarter issuance in US was up 14% with investment grade decreasing 2%, high-yield climbing 12%, public finance growing 19% and structured finance soaring 45% due primarily to a 143% increase in CLOs and advance of the implementation of risk retention regulations, which took place on December 24 and a 40% increase in ADS.", "In Europe, issuance decreased a 11% with investment grade declining 18%, high-yield decreasing 1% and structured finance increasing 5%. In Asia, issuance increased 1%. However, excluding issuance, that we do not rate, notably domestic China issuance, Asian issuance increased 8%.", "Let me now turn to market and commodities intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global market intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the fourth quarter reported revenue declined a 11% due to recent divestitures.", "Excluding these divestitures, organic revenue increased 8%. Despite disposing of businesses that contributed more than $100 million of quarterly revenue, adjusted operating profit increased 8%. This puts into perspective the enormous improvement that has taken place in the segment.", "Adjusted operating margin improved 600 basis points, primarily due to SNL integration synergies, Platts expense control, the divestiture of lower margin businesses and ForEx.", "Let me add a bit more color on the fourth quarter revenue growth in market intelligence. The most significant items in the quarter were the divestitures of the SPSE and CMA rising businesses, and equity and fund research. In addition, in January we divested Quant House.", "Due to the fourth quarter divestitures, revenue remained unchanged. However, organic revenue increased 10% with growth at four major products. Another highlight was the progress we made in the $100 million synergy target, as illustrated on this slide.", "Successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies was a full priority for the company in 2016. We made tremendous progress as evidenced in the margin improvement and remained committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and delivering on our expected return on investment in SNL.", "We estimate that two thirds of the $100 million synergy target was achieved at year-end 2016 on a run rate basis. We estimate that approximately one half of the $100 million is reflected in our full year 2016 results.", "We are particularly pleased to have achieve about $10 million in run rate revenue synergies, about one half of the revenue synergies came from utilizing Capital IQ relationships to sell the SNL global financial institutions product, about one quarter from using SNL relationships to sell the Capital IQ Desktop and one quarter from new business combining Cap IQ risk scorecards with SNL banks data.", "If you look at the markets within market intelligence more closely within financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7% with high single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ Desktop.", "In addition, SNL revenue increased 14% over the fourth quarter of 2015, SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth of 11% and 8%, respectively. Risk services revenue increased 10% led by growth in RatingsXpress.", "Platts delivered solid organic revenue growth in an improving commodity environment. Oil prices rallied around the OPEC agreement to cut production. PIRA forecasts 2017 oil prices in the range of $60 to 70 a barrel if OPEC members comply with the agreement.", "While the OPEC agreement provide support for the oil prices, RigData has reported that the weekly US rig count reached 782 in January and that\u2019s the highest level in over a year, rating downward pressure on pricing.", "Nevertheless, the outlook for many of our customers is better now than at the start of 2016. Fourth quarter revenue increased 12%. However, excluding revenue from recent acquisitions, organic revenue increased 5%, due to growth in subscriptions and double-digit growth in global trading services.", "The core subscription business delivered mid single digit revenue growth, led by the petroleum and petrochemical sectors. Global trading services double-digit revenue increase was primarily due to strong volumes.", "Now let me turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 13%, mostly due to ETF assets under management growth and increased data subscriptions. Adjusted operating profit increased 10%, primarily as a result of increased revenue.", "Adjusted operating margin declined 200 basis points to 61.6%, due primarily to the Trucost acquisition. Investments in a third data center, increased marketing costs, and higher cost of sales from growth in OTC derivatives activity.", "The highlight of the quarter was ETF AUM tied to our indices, booking $1 trillion in December. We celebrated a $500 billion mark in 2013 and three years later we doubled that milestone, clearly to trend from active to passive investing has been an advantage for the index business.", "Asset linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter. The exchange traded fund industry recorded enormous inflows for the second straight quarter, amassing $133 billion in the fourth quarter, driving yearly inflows of $380 billion, a new annual record.", "Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 19% year-over-year. As mentioned 2016, ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $1 trillion, increasing 25% over year-end 2015, with inflows of 15% and market appreciation 10%.", "Transaction revenue from exchange traded derivatives increased primarily due to an 8% increase in average daily volume of products based on our indices S&P 500 index options, that grow with a 22% increase in volume to VIX Options and Futures, and CME Equity complex contracts increased mid single-digit.", "Subscription revenue, which consists primarily of data subscriptions and custom indices increased 24% due to growth in data subscription revenue and the timing of subscription revenue. During the quarter the company launched 88 new indices and our partners launched new 23 new ETFs based on our indices.", "Our capital position is strong, as we look at the net debt of the company, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash, of which approximately $1.7 billion was held outside the US and $3.6 billion of long-term debt. Our debt coverage improved year-over-year as measured by gross debt to adjusted EBITDA from 1.6 times to 1.4 times.", "Free cash flow during the year was approximately $1.2 billion. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude activity associated with divestitures and related tax expenses and the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow in 2016 was nearly $1.5 billion.", "As for return of capital, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in 2016, $1.1 billion through share repurchases, as we completed our $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan in December and $380 million in dividends.", "Now, lastly, I will review our 2017 guidance. Based upon modestly improving global GDP and issuance growth, we introduced 2017 adjusted guidance as follows, mid single-digit organic revenue growth, the contributions by every business segment, unallocated expense $145 million to $150 million, a modest increase over 2016, due to investments in Asia and upfront investments in office consolidations, deal-related amortization of about $100 million, operating margin increase of roughly 100 basis points, interest expense of approximately $155 million, a tax rate of about 30% to 31%, diluted EPS which excludes deal-related amortization of $5.90 to $6.15.", "The range is wider than prior years due to recent that would be vast new guidance for accounting or stop payments to employees, which we estimate would increased EPS by $0.10 to $0.15 depending on SPGI's share price development and option exercise activity.", "Capital expenditures is a range of $125 million to $140 million, as we anticipate increased investments in technology, data and efficient real estate solutions. Free cash flow, excluding after tax, legal settlements and insurance recoveries of $1.6 billion and we expect an annual dividend of $1.64 per share.", "Our guidance does not take into consideration any potential policy changes from the new US administration. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2017 will be another strong year for the company.", "With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.", "Chip Merritt", "Thank you, Ewout. Just a couple instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we'll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. This question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. You may now ask your question.", "Alex Kramm", "Yes. Good morning, everyone. First of all, thanks for the Pokemon Go, that made a highlight of my day, so I nicely done. Secondly, in terms of the business, just wanted to come into the ratings guidance a little bit more, what you are expecting there?", "If I look at your business \u2013 the mid single digit growth for the whole company, and I looked like \u2013 I look at what index is running right now in terms of the run rate, and I look at where now market intelligence has probably growing consistently. It seems like it's a little bit conservative or light on the rating side. In particular, if you are telling us 3% growth in India in issuance.", "So either you are little bit less more conservative on pricing or you just conservative in general, but what are you expecting in terms of ratings revenue here?", "Doug Peterson", "Alex, this is Doug. Well, thank you for the - joining the call, and for your comments. On issuance, we've incorporated various factors into our issuance forecast. As you know, in the slides we gave you before, we showed you the expectations for issuance coming up.", "We've always talked before about the relationship between GDP growth and issuance being a stronger one than interest rate. As you know January had very strong issuance. The issuance in January was a record, it was a $532 billion. It was up 13.6% from the prior years.", "A lot of that issuance was in the US. The US was up 93%. We've incorporated that into the year. Our expectation is that the first half of the year should be fairly strong, given the overall investment profile that we expect of the economy and we've looked at more uncertainty in the second and half of the year, as we don't know exactly what the impact is going to be of the new administration aspects that are going to be rolling out, whether it's tax reform, regulatory reform, infrastructure investment, et cetera.", "In addition, we've incorporated some uncertainty into the second half the year related to Brexit and other geopolitical of aspects. But overall we're - we believe that 3% forecast which was prepared by our fixed income analytics team is the is strong, its based off of the combination of refinancing which we already aware of and we're expecting that most of that will come through. And then what we see in pipelines from meeting with investment banks and rating issuance advisors to build our forecast.", "But it still off of the base, as you know of those different factors and we're comfortable today that that\u2019s \u2013 what we're including in our guidance.", "Alex Kramm", "All right. Fair enough. Thank you. And then just secondly, quickly, maybe on the market intelligence side a little bit here. When we talk to customers, it sounds like you are increasingly bundling all these different products, which obviously you've put under one roof now.", "So maybe you can talk a little bit more about, there seems like there's more of a move to enter price pricing and it seems like you are able to maybe you know, gain a little bit of more pricing power in the process.", "So maybe just talk about what's going on there and how that could be impacting revenue, maybe more than what we've seen in the last couple of years?", "Doug Peterson", "We've made great progress on the integration of SNL and Cap IQ to turn it into market intelligence. As you know, we've been reporting on our synergies throughout that time and how we've done with the different expense synergies and revenue synergies.", "On our expense synergies, as you\u2019ve seen we've made excellent progress. This is allowed us to have an intensive focus on our commercial activities, on our operational activities and be able to address customer needs in a way that's more comprehensive and integrated across the Cap IQ and SNL platforms.", "As I mentioned in my remarks, we are developing and will be launching later this year, a pilot program market intelligence window which will allow us on the desktop through mobile platforms, et cetera to be able to address the needs of our customers. And what that's leading to from a commercial point of view, what your question is more specifically about, is that we can provide enterprise licenses which take into account the usage and the breadth of need of a firm and provide them with a more simple contract that allows in many cases, more users or more access to the system, which on the one hand, might as a per user basis end up maybe being less expensive to them, but they're using a lot more data and many more users in it which is very beneficial to us.", "So this like many of our different products and services across the company, these truly are a customer by customer basis in terms of how we deal with them and the sales process its a long professional sales market, sales process. We've restructured our sales team. So they are unified and they've been rolling out a comprehensive approach to our different markets, whether it's by regions or it\u2019s by different types of industries and segment.", "And as you pointed out that is our approach this year would be to rolling out, almost everywhere, but especially where it makes sense enterprise wide pricing for market intelligence.", "Alex Kramm", "Excellent. Thanks for the color.", "Doug Peterson", "Thanks, Alex.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Manav Patnaik", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations and welcome to Ewout to the call. May be just on the ratings question, in the other way to ask that question is, you're 3% issuance volume forecast for 2017. If you were to back out sovereign ratings, which I think you guys don\u2019t make much money on and then China domestic you said you don't do, what would that 3% number look like from a volume perspective?", "Doug Peterson", "If you just give me one second, I've got that calculated here. So let me just give you some of the numbers, more specifically the breakdown with and without those, I don't know if I have the aggregate number in front of me, but the - when you look at non-financial, it's going to be in a range of approximately 2% to 6%, financial institutions from about 1.5 to 4, structured is right now one of the areas that I am least certain about, its more in kind of the 0% to 6% range.", "And even though you look at the public finance potentially dropping a lot this year, given the headwinds and what we saw a very strong issuance last couple of year. So public finance could be down 5% to 10%.", "So overall issuance about 3% and excluding sovereigns in domestic China is also about 3%, once you take the positive upside in non-financial, what you've seen like in this first of month of the year. And then you subtract some of the downsides. We still in up with about 3%, excluding sovereign.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay. Got it. And then in the market intelligence side, I think you said two thirds of the $100 million was realized so far on a run rate basis and you are targeting three fourth by the end 2017. So is that being conservative or is that you know, factoring in I guess your new platform launch that probably requires a bunch of investments. I just wanted some color there in terms of the - how we should think about the progress?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Good morning, Manav. This is Ewout. We would certainly not consider that guidance as conservative. What you obviously might see when you do an integration is that you first take care of the low hanging fruits. That's why there's always a large acceleration of the benefits at the beginning and then the remaining of the integration synergy benefits from later during the year and take more time to achieve that.", "And so this is really the best guidance we have, we expect that the remaining of the gains will be more backend loaded, because it is the harder part of the synergies, especially related to bringing our products to a one platform, that is really the main outstanding where the remainder of the synergies will be achieved.", "Manav Patnaik", "Got it, Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Ms. Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Toni Kaplan", "Hi, good morning.", "Doug Peterson", "Morning.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Morning.", "Toni Kaplan", "Could you give us a rough breakdown of what drove the margin expansion within market intelligence this quarter on an apples-to-apples basis? Basically just trying to get at how much of the expansion was driven by legacy Cap IQ, Platts and from the SNL synergies?", "Doug Peterson", "Let me first of all just tell you what's some of the elements are, I don\u2019t know if I can give you a precise basis point by basis point approach to that. But as you remember we have a combination of the three different businesses within market intelligence which you\u2019ve seen the desktop, the enterprise business, the SNL businesses and the new risk services.", "We have Platt, we've taken out J.D. Power, we've taken out what was our pricing businesses, J.D. Power had generally a lower margin than the new average margin, the pricing businesses have higher-margin, than the actual businesses. But I don't have the actual numbers and I am going to look to Ewout to see if he has a chart with those actual numbers. But those are the elements that are incorporated into that margin.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Yes. And Toni, what I specifically would like to point out, is that the total margin change for market and commodities intelligence for the full year 2016 was 410 basis points. The FX element in that were 140 basis points.", "So that gives you the breakdown of how much was really underlying performance improvements, over the difference area versus the amount that came from FX and then as Doug said, there is the different elements of the businesses that are having different levels of margins. But we probably need to come back to you later on with more specifics on that.", "Toni Kaplan", "Okay. And are you providing updated targets for I guess market intelligence margin, now that the segment includes Platts?", "Doug Peterson", "Well, let me let me just tell you little bit about margins generally, if you don\u2019t mind, I'll give you some broader aspect to it. We don't have any guidance specifically about our margins, but we do have what I may call aspirations.", "As you know in the last few years we've had an intensive focus on margins, that\u2019s a combination of improving commercial activities, growing the top line, as well as maintaining productivity and being very disciplined around investment.", "In ratings, we aspire to be with a \u2013 to have a five handle, its beginning of our margin where we've been there over quarters, but we aspire to be in the low 50s and this we help - we believe we could get there through the continued commercial discipline in some of our productivity programs.", "In the market commodity intelligence segment, we aspire to the mid to high 30s. We think that as we complete our synergy programs over the next couple years, as well as ongoing productivity program and commercial programs that we've be aspiring towards that.", "In index, we do not have a target. We are very comfortable with the level of margin that we have now in the 66 - in the last years or so it\u2019s between 60 and 66. We know that there's kind of \u2013 it popped around a little bit. But we don't have any target that\u2019s different than what we have there and which should be in the low 60s. But those are the - up for the three segments. Those are the - our aspiration of our margin.", "Toni Kaplan", "Terrific. Thanks, congrats of the quarter.", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks, Toni.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Research. You may ask your question.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just - if you could just give us an update on European bank disintermediation and whether Europe's mix, how does that stack up to the US in terms of loans and bonds?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes. So that is a \u2013 that\u2019s been something that's been really interesting, as we continue to watch the development of the European market. It almost kind of goes and fits and start between when do you see issuance that\u2019s starting off in the European markets and you get some very strong orders of European issuance and then you get some very weak orders in issuance.", "The main factor which is inhibiting that is really the ECB liquidity program. The ECB liquidity programs has continued to provide a lot of liquidity in the European banks and it's basically between the strength of their capital which is been improving in European liquidity programs that are in-place.", "It\u2019s allowing the banks to continue to be strong lenders, but there is a general shift overall towards more and more issuance in the market. Just as an example, in this year - during the year that was in January you saw the issuance go up in Europe in financial institution, in the industrial it was down a little bit, you've also seen more in sovereign. So total Europe was up about 13% in January.", "Over the last couple years, it's been up and down, it goes from being up to flat, et cetera. But I do think it\u2019s the most important aspect or is really combination of what we see happening with the LTRO programs, the ECB liquidity programs and the overall bank behavior that they're holding more and more credit on their balance sheet.", "Now the other final point I'd make is that the ECB itself has a very high demand for the purchase of assets. They continue as quantitative easing program and assets they want to buy or investment grade debt security and ECB itself has been talking about promoting the development of capital markets.", "In addition, there is a program based out of Brussels called the Capital Markets Union. The Brussels financial - the financial regulators are all in favor of having a more cohesive and more European wide approached capital market. So we are very close to those initiatives.", "We have people in Brussels. We visit Brussels a lot. We visit all of the major financial capital and we believe that this will continue to be a positive over the long run, but it might be going in fits and starts.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Great. And just a follow-up, within the Indices business, are you concerned that all around fee pressure with given how concentrated the ETF market is, I know back in 2012 you had a \u2013 we had a Vanguard change the way that they looked at their customer base.", "I know there were more retail versus institutional. But you know, any color around how you're thinking about fee pressure in the Indices business or is that just not a concern?", "Doug Peterson", "It is a concern to the extent that we're going through a lot of change in the industry and if I told you otherwise, I probably would be telling you something we spend a lot of time thinking about. We do have though a few factors which we think position us incredibly well.", "One is that we have benchmarks that are must have benchmarks, like the S&P and Dow Jones and other branded benchmarks that we have that are really necessary for whether it's the actual ETFs or other investment products or for the data that\u2019s required by investment managers to be able to benchmark their portfolios in their performance. So we think that we have one advantages in terms of the types of brands and the kinds of products we have.", "The second is maybe a little bit, if you go back to microeconomics and remember those curves of elasticity of demand and some of the products which we believe are going to see price cut, the price cut might be offset by the volume growth. And I don't want to say that that's always going to sort of work out that way.", "But if you look at the overall growth of volume in this industry and the recent DOL [ph] of ruling which looks like it might be reversed, was going to probably benefit ETF and passive investment.", "We probably see some sort of passive investment benefit from a lot of these trends that will also benefit us. So even if some of the fees do go down and there is some fee pressure, we should be seeing some advantage of that from volume.", "Just as an example, we mentioned it in our call, but it was just three years ago that we were across the $500 billion line for ETF AUMs and we now crossed a $1 trillion at the end of the year last year, even only a year ago we were $815 billion.", "So the growth in these - it's a combination of new flows into the asset classes, as well as obviously increasing the value of the indices themselves that we see that from, but we do - we are very aware of the cost pressure.", "We are working closely with ETF providers and others and it\u2019s something that we are ensuring that we can maintain a leadership position in the quality of our benchmark, the positioning that they have. But pricing pressure is something that we're aware of and we're trying to actively manage towards it.", "Hamzah Mazari", "All right. Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.", "Jeff Silber", "Thanks so much. I wanted to go back to some of the debt issuance trends you were talking about earlier, you mentioned January was a real strong month, specifically in the US.", "Do you think any of your US clients might be front running some potential policy changes and will get a bit inflow early on in the year that will paper as the year progresses?", "Doug Peterson", "It\u2019s really hard for me to project. I've been doing this for now almost 6 years and every quarter there is a different mix of what has been attractive in the markets, it depends on investment, on growth, on GDP growth, on what the interest rate environment is going to be, what Janet Yellen might do with interest rates, what the net exchange rates is going to be for people have global operation.", "I \u2013 its possible if there's some pull forward that\u2019s taken place in January, it's also possible there were some pull forward into the fourth quarter, but there is a very healthy refinancing pipeline that we look at, some of the issuance that was done in January was issuance by companies that have - already have incredible amounts of cash on their balance sheet, like Microsoft and IBM and AT&T and Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo and BoA.", "And so the largest issuers in January weren't necessarily those that needed the cash, they also were all corporation and have massive amounts of cash offshore. So I don't know, I can't really answer your question about this pull forward or not.", "But we do in our forecast, if you look at the forecast that we prepared, we do have a more robust first half of the year than the second half year in the forecast that we've prepared, which was the 3% growth in issuance for 2017.", "Jeff Silber", "All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I could just switch over to margin, you were kind of enough to give us some of your long-term target by segment. I know you don\u2019t usually guide by specific segment for the year.", "But I'm just wondering directionally what you're incorporating for margins by segment to get to your target for the company overall? Thanks.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "We don't give specific by segments. But as we said in the prepared remarks that we expect margin expansion for each of our businesses.", "Jeff Silber", "Okay. great. I'll follow up offline. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Peter Appert", "Thanks. Good morning. So Doug the strength in the fourth quarter ratings revenue performance is very impressive. I am wondering if it's possible to give us any granularity in terms of the drivers of the revenue performance, in terms of market share or pricing and just overall market growth?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Let me give you some of the components here. And so I'm looking here at the revenue components, if you make a breakdown between transaction and non-transaction, transaction was up 26%, non-transaction was up 5%.", "If you look at a breakdown by region, US saw the largest growth of close to 17%. The EMEA region was around 6%, Asia, ex-Japan was around 8% and Japan itself was 13% and then the rest of were other small numbers. I have to note that Canada had as quite large increase of 63%.", "If you look at another breakdown of revenue, corporates we so up by 18%, financial services down 9%, infrastructure up 40%, US public 37%, sovereigns 10% and structure 11%. So overall I could say revenue was up very strong across the board.", "We saw expenses up $30 million quarter-over-quarter. That has mostly to do with incentive compensation and catch up, given the strong results for the quarter itself. So if you look at the combination of strong revenue growth across the board, in almost all regions and issuer types, as well as really good expense control with the one change an increase related to incentive compensation, we saw those margins in the ratings went up in a very healthy way.", "Doug Peterson", "Peter, let me add that if you go back to the slides that Ewout presented, there is a new slide which shows the revenue mix across broad categories. We thought it was helpful for you to see a little bit further breakdown on that and I don't remember the actual slide number. We can pull that that up.", "But it shows where we've got the growth across the different business segments and is an example in financials there was a drop in the fourth quarter, in financial issuance from 115 to 104, that\u2019s our revenue mix. In corporates they went up 20% from 283 to 340.", "We think that that should also help to give you some kind of the direction as to what the - what issuance trends are, as well as the revenue that we're seeing from those and you can get a view across the board how we think we're doing those different groups. And all of them are a combination of all the different factors which Ewout mentioned.", "Peter Appert", "Got it. Thank you. And then\u2026", "Doug Peterson", "At slide 29, sorry.", "Peter Appert", "Okay, great. Thank you. Do you have any preliminary thoughts on how potential changes in Dodd-Frank might impact the business?", "Doug Peterson", "Not really, we have looked at Dodd Frank, there's really two aspects to it that I could mention, but this is \u2013 think of this little bit more speculation as because we don\u2019t have a lot of facts as to where this might go.", "On the - on ourselves, we believe that the overall Dodd Frank rules that is coming in place are similar to the other 21, I guess jurisdictions around the world, where we're also rated. So even if Dodd Frank changes it\u2019s not going to change our operating model very much because we're regulated as similarly or even more heavily in other jurisdictions like it by ASMA [ph] in Europe.", "So there might be changes to Dodd Frank, they can have some small benefits to us in the US, but they're not necessary they're going have that much of an impact if we have to continue to comply with a similar or the exact same kind of provisions everywhere else in the world.", "On the actual markets themselves, to the extent that there are Dodd Frank provisions which improve market liquidity or investor issuer access or clarify some of the things around, for instance of Volcker rules we see.", "Thanks for getting back into more proprietary trading and a higher liquidity in issuance in the markets or if there was a change to the of risk retention rule that allowed CLOs and CMBS issuance to explode if there \u2013 it has been that much of an impact from the risk retention rule, I can't quite tell, but it looks like it might be a slight impact.", "But those are the things that could be more market impact. They don't have anything to do with us directly. But if they end up providing an environment where there is growth in the market, in particular growth in financial markets, higher liquidity, higher issuance, we would potentially benefit from that.", "Peter Appert", "Thank you, Doug.", "Doug Peterson", "Thanks, Peter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Tim McHugh of William Blair. You may ask your question.", "Tim McHugh", "Yes, thanks. Just following a little bit on that question. I guess, I think it was getting some of your initiatives to improve pricing and I guess the strength in bank loans. How much \u2013 were there any kind of big incremental changes in the fourth quarter and I guess how much more room is there to run with trying to drive \u2013 I guess, your improvement even relative to whatever the market does?", "Doug Peterson", "Well, I don't know if I call it relative to what the market does, but relative to ourselves, we've had a, what I would call a multiyear program to bolster our of commercial activities in the rating agency, a result of our own changes in Dodd Frank we have hired a world-class team of commercial people in our rating agency.", "They are now out building relationships with customers, anticipating their needs for capital markets activities by looking at their own exposures around the globe and by being closer in a relationship, having this relationship model, its allowed us to also demonstrate what is the value that we bring and have a one-off, as I call them kind of individual conversation and negotiations with customers around the globe.", "And we've started seeing the benefit of that from higher contract realization and we expect that that will continue to flow through in 2017. We saw the benefit of that in last year, some of that into the fourth quarter. But it is part of our top line growth strategy is to have these one-off relationship conversation with the issuers, to ensure that they understand the value and we can see some of that value through improved pricing in contractual terms.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay. Thanks. And then SNL the growth rate improved there versus a little bit of resources. What you guys have been talking about it, I know you listened a couple of different areas of that business that did well.", "But was there anything in particular that changed, I guess in terms of the performance or got much better that drove the acceleration?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes, if you look you know, for the last I guess, 12 years or so, we've grown over 12% per year, you just bounce in the low teens from quarter-to-quarter, I think with this kind of noise quarter-to-quarter whether there 10% or 14%.", "With indices nice strength in the internationals big product, which is one of new things we're launching and conversely we don't see much strength in metals and mining work, this difficult environment.", "So those were two kind of newest areas that we've been focusing on. Overall together its kind of better than our model, but it just kind of bounces quarter-to-quarter, are difficult to explain that.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.", "Bill Warmington", "So good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the strong quarter and also welcome to Ewout. So first question I wanted to ask about the Platts organic revenue growth. It has been trending down for the past three quarters, and this quarter it showed an improvement up to 5%.", "And so I wanted to ask whether you're seeing an inflection point in renewals and how those are going, whether you think the stabilization in oil price is helping and if you're seeing any differences there you know, US clients versus international clients?", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you for that question. On Platts, on our top line growth, it clearly is the combination of all the factors that you discussed. As you remember a few years ago and going back to the question about Dodd Frank, there was - one of the provisions of Dodd Frank ended up that all of the major financial institutions exited the commodities businesses, and now it had been a major drag on our top line growth and on our revenue level is all of the major global financial institutions exited commodities - trading and commodities businesses.", "A few of those have a tiny trading desk left, but most of them sold their commodities businesses to other trading organization, who are already our customers and we saw some loss of revenue there, that had been a headwind.", "There was also a headwind when you saw the oil price, which had been in the $100 range drop into the 20s and 30s and it put a lot of pressure on our major customers that are producers on the upstream side, who are getting squeezed by their - on their profit margins and they were in tough negotiations to see what kind of renewal levels we get, what kind of increase in pricing. So there were some headwinds there.", "Obviously on the other hand, some of the users, power plants and airlines and others saw a big benefit from the lower oil prices and low energy prices and we had some potential upside there.", "But I think we're getting into a normalized position with the oil prices in the 40s, 50s and 60s. There still are some organizations but that's not the right level that they can be very profitable in. But we do think that we will look carefully at the overall market positioning. We felt that the increase in more maybe more stable oil market benefits us.", "And as you know, one of our revenue streams that we talk about is the market services area. So it\u2019s not just the - we saw a strong growth in that area which is one of the other areas.", "So we're not only just a subscription business, but we do have a small amount of our revenue coming from market and trading services and that area did benefit from the volatility as the market moves back up from the lower price to the middle price.", "So every factor you mentioned are things that we watched. We think that we're in a more stable environment. We don't think that there's going to be anybody getting in and out of this business and we'll be negotiating throughout this year ongoing long-term contract.", "Bill Warmington", "And probably second question, just a housekeeping question. The 590 to 615 EPS guidance, does that include or assume a $0.10 to $0.15 benefit from the stock-based comp in that or would that stock-based comp be incremental to that 590 to 615?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "That includes the $0.10 to $0.15 from the accounting change for Texas-based payments.", "Bill Warmington", "Great. All right, thank you very much and congratulations again.", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks, Bill. And Bill I don\u2019t want to thank any of them, I want to clarify this right now, the pronunciation is Ewout, the W is capital to V, so it\u2019s Ewout for everybody.", "Bill Warmington", "Ewout. Thank you very much.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "No problem, Bill.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question.", "James Friedman", "Hi. I wanted to \u2013 just ask my two upfront. Ewout, I was wondering if you could repeat what you said if anything about what assumptions are embedded with regard to repurchase, I heard the stock-based comp, but the repurchase?", "And then Doug, if I could ask, just because we get this one a lot too deep into the pool, but with regard to the border adjustability tax, if you could just give us the cliff notes from your view at least, is the \u2013 do you think of the company as an exporter, and you know, maybe if you can give us some qualitative observations about that, that will be helpful?. Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Let me start James, good morning. Regarding the assumptions underneath our EPS guidance with respect to buyback activities, at this moment cannot specifically comment on the size and timing for obvious reasons. But what I can say is the following, we will continue with buyback activities also in 2017, following the strong track record of the company.", "We believe it's a good use of the strong cash position we have and also the strong future cash generation we predict and we believe our stock today is attractive at current levels. We will be of course be disciplined and focused on the way how we really can create value enhancement for shareholders.", "So definitely there is an assumption with respect to buyback, but it cannot give you the specifics, but I hope that gives you a flavor for the underlying philosophy, and especially the disciplines, capital management we will apply as a company.", "Doug Peterson", "And let me pick up the question the border adjustability, as you know that the tax code was updated 30 years ago in 1986 and at the time our economy and the tax code is still very much skewed towards agriculture and manufacturing, especially with preferences and special exemptions for lot of industries. And it's been a long time that we needed an update of our tax system.", "We also have the \u2013as you know, and one of the highest tax - corporate tax rate in industrialized world with us ourselves paying over 30% rate, which is been very high. Now specifically related to border adjustability, this is one of those - one of those areas that is probably quite controversial because the way it impacts different types of organization.", "As you know because we have such a high tax rate any lowering of rate would benefit us and then specifically in border adjustability, we're an intellectual property firm that is been around for long time and our intellectual property is principally registered in the US and in fact, even in New York.", "And when we sell and we have customers that are paying us from offshore to use our ratings or our indices or market intelligence or re Platts data and that is being purchased overseas, that would be considered to be an export of services and we would benefit from a lower tax rate or from the border adjustability where we would not be having to pay a tax on that export of services.", "I don't have a specific dimension yet that I could tell you exactly what the benefit could be because we don't have enough of the proposal. But I would tell you that we would be a major beneficiary of that border adjustability and it's something that as that is developed we have our tax team, our economic team, our are public affairs team, et cetera are working closely with other advocacy groups and organizations in Washington to understand all these proposals and what the impact might be. But this is one that for us could be a major benefit.", "James Friedman", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Craig Huber of Huber Research. You may ask your question.", "Craig Huber", "Yes, good morning. My first question I guess, has to do with interest expense deductibility this whole issue, if it will or will not be included in the potential tax plan later this year, if it is included in there, and I guess depending on how it may be structured if someone like Germany were going to deduct that interest expense at about 30% of EBITDA or of its 100% eliminated.", "What is your \u2013 on those two different scenarios, German one versus getting at a 100%, what is your general thought again with further what it would to the corporate finance debt issuance once it gets up and rolling in 2018 or something\u2026", "Doug Peterson", "Yes, and Craig, as you can imagine from my prior answer, where this is also on our list with the same teams that we're looking out with advocacy groups and our tax accounting, finance, public affairs groups, et cetera.", "This is one of those proposals that we think would have a - also but tends to have a negative impact on issuance. Clearly, it's a proposal that is linked with a pay for to other sorts of changes in the tax code. For example, accelerated, depreciation would be paid for with elimination of the interest rate deductibility.", "So we see it, typically in combination with other types of - other types of benefits which then need to get paid for it and they were paid for by this interest rate deductibility. In all of the work that we've done looking at the different systems, we think that the major impact is going to be on high yield issuers.", "And as you know, if you go back to what's the typical deal thesis of leveraged buyout or of many sponsor deal, there is a - the high-yield debt not only provide them access to capital and improves in ROE, it also provides a tax shield and the interest rate expense itself is part of the deal calculation as to what's sort of tax shield you get from the interest rate. And so this is the part of the yield curve and the credit card where we think they will be the biggest impact and potentially issuance could get hit there.", "When we look at the higher quality end of the rating scale. So, blue-chip companies, investment grade companies, even without the deduction, we think that would still be more attractive to companies in issuing equity.", "I don't think companies are going to be wanting to flood the market with equity, do their financing. There might be a boon to investment bankers to structure hybrid or other sorts of instruments that could be a debt like or maybe equity like, but not considered to be a common equity.", "We do rate a lot of those types of instruments. So preferred shares and in anything with kind of fixed coupon, we do - we do rate those kind of equities or things like that. But we do think that overall elimination of interest rate deductibility would probably be a net negative to issuance and that we're operating on right now.", "But we're trying to look very closely at the market and what the actual proposal is since we don\u2019t really know what the proposal is and what it\u2019s going to.", "So we're going to have to watch this. We do know that over the long-term in issuance levels are much more related to GDP growth. But this discussion about interest rate deductibility and tax law changes, does throw some new elements into our planning and our thinking that we've got to be very close to.", "Craig Huber", "And then I had a question please on your S&P ratings business, up 14% revenue growth, just to want to in a quarter, I want to better understand - this better contract terms of roughly last year you guys changed your contract terms with your customers the help you put on them, that on pricing side for you guys.", "Do you have a sense of how much that 14 percentage points of growth came from better contract pricing and then also as you think out to 2017, is there much left to do, I realize its generally analyzed from what you can change you to help boost revenue growth in 2017, and help quantify that, was that a few 100 basis points are not event that?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "We don't quantify the amount of the contract changes Greg, so we can't help you with that portion of the question. What was the other part of your question, I apologize.", "Craig Huber", "Is there a much left to go with a set of\u2026", "Ewout Steenbergen", "And as Doug mentioned earlier, so we think we made some nice progress in 2016. We think there's more progress that can be made 2017. And I would say in those two years that will be probably the bulk of the progress on these programs we're working on. It could be a little tail after that, but most of it would be in '16 and '17.", "Craig Huber", "Okay. Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks, Craig.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.", "Mike Reid", "Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking our call. Can you give a little color on just on the continued prospects for indices outside of equities? I guess including fixed income, all the way through the custom indices. And also do you see the custom indices helping you gain market share?", "Doug Peterson", "Well, first of all on index as you know we have been diversifying our business in various ways. One of them is through different sorts of indices, as you mentioned fixed income indices, right now that is a very, very new industry, so to speak. Its just recently have the index of large index complexes started moving into organization to see them on a professional index managed approach to building up ETF products, et cetera.", "We think that that space is still wide open and one that there's not a lot of ETF volume and should be growing and we're hoping to pay much larger position t here. Custom indices and factor indices are getting very popular, specially with family offices, sovereign wealth fund and investors that need some sort of benchmark to manage specific against risk or asset liability matching in their portfolio. We continue to see that is an area where we're investing and growing.", "We also have two other areas I want to mention, one in the ESG. We've bought Trucost and Trucost is an organization that provides a very precise and high quality climate and water and other sorts of environmental facts, environmental data. We're able to use that to build environmental or climate or other ESG type fund.", "We see a very high demand for data and analytics and now increasingly also helpful for fund that has incorporate ESG or sustainability or long-term growth type factors, especially coming from sovereign wealth funds and from pensions and endowments in northern Europe and some places around Europe and United States. So that's another area of growth.", "And then generally across the business, we're looking to see how we can capitalize off of the value of our data more and more and see that is one of our growth areas and not just the traditional ways that we've had with AUMs and a fund approach in using our benchmarks into the fund area.", "So data and data and analytics is an area that we are looking at and that's where some of the other aspects to how the data is used, how we look at market et cetera, we're thinking that there should be some opportunities there as well.", "Mike Reid", "Thanks. Thank you for the color on that.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.", "Andre Benjamin", "Thanks. Good morning. So my question is back to tax reform, I was wondering if you are talking to any of the larger CFO, how they think about their balance sheet and EPS impact. I was just wondering is there any indication that people are putting more weight on the impact of funding costs versus the bottoms up impact on EPS, I am just trying to some inside into how CFOs are actually weighing those offsetting factors?", "Doug Peterson", "Andre, I don't have enough of base of discussions yet to give you - to give you like a scientific answer, I can just tell you anecdotally, this every CEO and every CFO that we've been meeting with are studying the tax reform proposals the same way we are.", "There is then \u2013 if you met with the largest organization's, the largest global organizations and if you look at the repatriation topic which we haven't touched on, repatriation is one that also has a very large impact on companies and could have as I mentioned in my comments a shorter-term impact on issuance if people brought back a lot of cash and don't need to go to market. We don\u2019t we'll have a long-term impact.", "But there's a lot of corporations that have literally - there is a couple trillion dollars $2.5 trillion we believe in overseas cash that could also going into that equation. And I don't - as I said, I only have anecdotal evidence, I do not have anything that\u2019s scientific yet.", "Each company is impacted differently, if you went in that with retailers that import a lot of their products from offshore, if it's - weather clothing, apparel, toys, electronics, et cetera, this the approach towards the border adjustability has a very negative impact on them. If you speak with large exporters, like GE and Boeing and Caterpillar, order adjustability is a very positive impact on them.", "A lot of the CFOs of the more highly rated companies, the combination of a much lower tax rate and interest deductibility are kind of a wash. And so they would say that it's not going to - the interest rate deductibility is not going to have any impact whatsoever on their issuance programs because net-net, the net after tax cost as even can be lower because the interest rate is lowered so much.", "So again, I can only be anecdotal. I would hope that as we go throughout the years and we get more specific proposals that I could give you better answers then I just did. But those are the kinds of factors that are being looked at in the kinds of conversations we've been having. But right now it's all anecdotal.", "Andre Benjamin", "All right. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess just one homework question, model keeping, from as the combined market intelligence Platts business going forward, as we combine those segments in our model, should we assume that we'll continue to get the individual revenue from market intelligence and Platts going forward?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes. We will disclose that\u2019s going forward as well. So you should see the breakdown in the future.", "Andre Benjamin", "All right. Thank you.", "Doug Peterson", "Thanks, Andre.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now take our final question from Ansh Singh from Credit Suisse. You may now ask your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning, guys. My first question on the revenue synergies inside of market intelligence related to the integration that\u2019s going on. I realize you spoke to some left from synergies in the quarter, but hoping for some more color on how that's going, is it going along with your expectations, slightly better, slightly weaker. Just wanted to get your perspective on how customers are responding to your early cross-selling integration efforts?", "Doug Peterson", "It\u2019s better than expectation. They had a target, and we cannot necessarily share with you folks, on what they would accomplish at this point in time, and the $10 million target has exceeded - or the number has exceeded at target. So they were very pleased with that.", "But once again this is still early days because its a lot of piloting going on as you know, Cap IQ reps are going to Cap IQ customers and saying hey, look our arsenal product, let me show you what we do this.", "But to me the biggest move really can't take place until you have one integrated platform, right. That\u2019s when you can really begin to shape customers behavior were meaningfully and that\u2019s not going to be for a while.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "They are going to start to beta testing that in the third quarter with a very limited number of customers, but we expect that that will really be more of a fourth-quarter event when the market intelligence 1.0 platform is potentially ready for rolling out more - on a more broader basis.", "But just as slight a different answer to your question. We're very pleased with the integration of SNL. Its been something that we made some of very tough management decisions when we brought on board, in terms of how we're going to manage the organization, putting these businesses together, which was not necessarily something was very natural for this organization and it's paid off by making those tough decisions right up front and having an excellent management team from SNL that came on board and incorporated some of the best management from the company that was already here.", "And generally speaking, we've been ahead of our targets and we've been able to execute in a way that we've had a very good financial performance, principally from expense management, we're now focusing more and more on revenues and we have a few really good early wins.", "But I don't want to promise that we can get the same kind of speed of execution on the revenue synergies that we did on expense energy. But it's something we're tracking, we're watching and I'm hopeful that we will. But it\u2019s a lot harder than getting the expense synergy.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then one last one for me, as it relates to your mid single-digit guidance on revenue, would it be fair to say you're incorporating the most conservatism on your ratings business versus the other ones, hoping for some color on factors that drive you to lower end versus upper end, given that a lot of the potential changes impacting issuance aren\u2019t really getting factored into your outlook at this stage? Thanks.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Ansh, how you should see our guidance is really middle of the road, it\u2019s neither conservative nor aggressive. That is the philosophy we apply. We think the guidance we have provided for 2017 is strong guidance form all aspects, high growth, margin expansion, EPS growth, excluding the accounting change. So we're in a range of 8.5% to 12%.", "So we think this is a very strong guidance we have provided. There is no particular conservatism in this, its really considered middle of the road.", "Doug Peterson", "And I'll just \u2013 just one methodic add, and this is not of intent to point - your view is probably similar to other folks out there. January was a great month, if January was a horrible month, maybe that question would even come in, but we can't concern ourselves with one month out of 12 because we know that once every single year it\u2019s choppy for month-to-month. So we can't be swayed by one particular month, as we think about our annual guidance.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Chip Merritt", "Well, thank everyone for joining the call this morning. As you see we had a very memorable year in 2016. There was a lot of uncertainty in the markets, a lot of change going on with things like the Brexit and US elections, many of those uncertainties continue into 2017, some of the topics we just talked about on issuance trends, tax changes, Dodd-Frank, regulatory changes, et cetera.", "We have people all over those and gene4rally speaking we've got our entire organization focused on growth and excellence and we are very excited about the prospects of taking this reshaped, very cohesive portfolio of companies forward.", "We appreciate your interest for all the shareholders on the line, we thank you for being shareholders in the company and we are excited about the prospects, despite some of the uncertainty in the markets and we are very pleased you joined the call this morning. And thank you very much.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning\u2019s call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. A replay of this call, including the question-and-answer session will be available in about two hours. The replay will be maintained on S&P Global's website for 12 months from today and for one month from today by telephone.

I'd like to inform you this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] To access the webcast and slides, go to www.mhfi.com -- that's MHFI for McGraw Hill Financial, Inc. dot-com -- and click on the link for the second quarter earnings webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for McGraw Hill Financial. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us this morning for McGraw Hill Financial's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO; Doug Peterson, President of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services; and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Ken Vittor, our General Counsel.", "This morning, we issued a news releases with our results. I trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results also reflect the reclassification of McGraw-Hill Education as discontinued operation.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "I would also like to call your attention to a new European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of McGraw Hill Financial should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and, potentially, the company.", "We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors and would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 512-3151 subsequent to this call.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III. Terry?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thank you, Chip. And Chip, you do such a great job representing all our shareholders. I thank you for that. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us, and welcome to today's conference call.", "I'd like to begin this call by summarizing the highlights that we will cover today. Our second quarter results contributed to the strong momentum that we have delivered since reporting McGraw Hill Financial results separately. In fact, so far this year, our revenue has increased 15%, and adjusted diluted EPS has increased 30%. We will provide a legal update. I know this is a topic that many are watching closely. We also have our next President and CEO, Doug Peterson, on today's call to make some comments about his new role and discuss the results of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, the business he is currently running, and to give you a chance to ask him any questions during the Q&A. We will also discuss our plans to take a larger stake in CRISIL. This is India's largest rating agency. We'll also discuss very briefly our recent announcement to sell the Aviation Week group. And lastly, as part of Jack Callahan's financial discussion, we will share our newly increased 2013 EPS guidance.", "All right, so let's turn to the financial performance during the second quarter. Our initial full year 2013 guidance called for a high single-digit revenue growth and approximately 15% diluted adjusted EPS growth. However, during the second quarter, we delivered 17% revenue growth and 31% diluted adjusted EPS growth, reaching $0.92 per share. Our 3 strongest benchmark businesses led the growth again this quarter: Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Platts and S&P Dow Jones Indices. Cost control and accelerated share repurchase program also contributed to the EPS increase.", "While we're clearly off to a very solid start, keep in mind that comparisons will become a little bit more difficult because of each quarter of 2012, we delivered sequential increases in revenue and diluted adjusted earnings per share. In addition, Doug will discuss recent trends in issuance, of which we need to be mindful of.", "We shared this chart with you last quarter but felt that it was important to share it again as the makeup of the company has changed so dramatically. These 2 pie charts should help put into perspective the revenue and operating earnings contribution of each of our business segments. Not surprisingly, Standard & Poor's Rating Services is our largest segment, with each of the remaining 3 contributing a comparable level of operating profit.", "This morning, I also want to focus on some of the things that are of interest to everyone. Since our legal issues are attracting some attention of late, I thought we would bring them to the forefront of today's discussion. Let me go through some of this with you. With regard to the Department of Justice case, oral argument was held on July 8 in the Federal Court in California. On July 16, the court denied our motion to dismiss. The decision included the following statement: \"The court finds that the government has sufficiently pleaded the intent required to support its fraud claims. Any disputes over the veracity of these claims or contested facts are properly challenged at a later stage of litigation.\" It also stated, \"S&P might disagree with the government's versions of these facts, but the opportunity to challenge such factual allegation comes later in the litigation process.\" While I'm sure that all of you would like us to discuss our view in great detail and provide additional support for our position, the court has made it abundantly clear that it does not want either party trying this case in the media. Since we will adhere to that request, we will not provide any additional commentary regarding the complaint, except to repeat what we've said all along that it has no merit, and we look forward to demonstrating that in the court.", "With regard to the state actions, in June, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, that's JPML, Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, transferred most of the State AG actions to a single federal judge in Manhattan. The JPML found, \"That these actions involve common questions of fact and that centralization of all these actions in the Southern District of New York will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation.\" The New York Federal Court must now decide whether the State AG actions were properly removed to the federal court. Oral argument on this issue is scheduled to be held on October 4.", "Please note that these transferred federal actions involve most of the State Attorney General cases. However, California, Illinois and Connecticut have not been consolidated with the other State AG cases and will remain as separate actions in state courts.", "In other litigations, we continue to build upon our positive track record during the quarter. 33 cases have now been dismissed outright, including the June dismissal of the Tolin case by a federal district court in New York City. In the Tolin case, the court stated, \"The complaint fails by a wide margin to allege adequately that S&P did not believe the ratings when it made them. The complaint fails entirely to allege, let alone with particularity, what S&P's state of mind was at the time it issued the particular ratings at issue in this case.\"", "Now 11 dismissals by lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts, and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. That leaves us with a few dozen nongovernment cases that remain outstanding.", "Some new cases have been filed very recently and, apparently, in an effort to avert the statute of limitation expirations, which is a possible defense for us after so many years passing since the issuance of the ratings at issue. Some of these new cases include other rating agencies as codefendants as well.", "And in our legal and regulatory topic, the United States Supreme Court has denied the International Securities Exchange, the ISE's petition seeking review of the Illinois Appellate Court's ruling that prohibits ISE from listing or providing an exchange market for the trading of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average options and the OCC from issuing, clearing or settling the exercise of such ISE options without permission. This ruling just reinforces the intellectual property rights of the S&P Dow Jones Indices, as well as other index providers. This ruling supports the same legal issue that our General Counsel, Ken Vittor, who is with us this morning, first successfully defended on our behalf back in 1982.", "Okay, with that, let's turn to the individual businesses, and I'll start with the S&P Dow Jones Indices. In the second quarter, organic revenue increased 6% to $94 million, and the addition of the Dow Jones Index revenue brought total revenue to $123 million. The principal driver of the organic revenue growth was a 34% increase in quarter-ending assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices, which reached more than $469 billion. Including the assets under management linked to Dow Jones Indexes, assets under management reached $546 billion at the end of the quarter. It is important to note that the revenue impact is not as pronounced as the growth in assets under management, as the basis points charged are not always linear with asset growth.", "Trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives increased 11%. With equity prices at or near record levels, market participants increased hedging activities, thereby driving higher daily contract volume for the S&P 500 Index Options and the CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX, at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. This is the last quarter that we will be breaking out the revenue associated with the Dow Jones Indexes as the joint venture was in place for all of the third quarter of 2012.", "While the joint venture realized $80 million of adjusted operating profits, $60 million is retained by us as 27% of the profit is forwarded to our partner, the CME. It is critical that we continue to invest in our benchmark businesses to keep the brand prominent and well understood. To that end, the company launched a new advertising campaign in The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times and other print and digital media.", "And while we invest in the brand, we are also investing in the product. During the second quarter, we launched 33 new indices. Many of them deviate from our core strength in U.S. equities. Some notable examples of these new indices include non-Shariah-compliant indices, the S&P GSCI Roll Weight Select, the Dow Jones Real Estate Risk Control, Intermediate Duration Muni Yield, Korea and Nordic Low Volatility and the S&P/ISDA U.S. 150 Credit Spread. These new indices and others will help us continue to diversify and grow this important business.", "With that, let me now move on to S&P Capital IQ. In the second quarter, this business delivered top line growth of 3%. Two key offerings, Capital IQ Desktop and RatingsXpress, led the revenue growth. These results were offset somewhat by declines in revenue from proprietary research. In a market characterized by customer-employee cutbacks, S&P Capital IQ delivered 16% user growth, excluding government and university users, to more than 54,000. When large enterprise accounts and broad-tiered pricing are excluded, user growth increased mid-single-digit. Adjusted operating profit decreased 7%, and there was a decline in the operating margin, as increased investment in content and technology continued to reduce some profitability. These investments are leading to innovative real time solutions beyond the QuantHouse exchange data feed business that has already been launched. S&P Capital IQ's new Portfolio Risk solution product that I'm going to discuss in a little bit more detail in just a moment, was created from the acquisition of R2, coupled with considerable investment in innovation over the past year.", "But before I turn to that, I thought I would take a moment to add some clarity to the S&P Capital IQ business line. This chart depicts the 4 primary categories of the business and the capabilities that each offers. As you can see, Capital IQ is one of numerous capabilities offered within this business line. Lou Eccleston, who runs S&P Capital IQ, and his team have been working to upgrade this portfolio. The more promising pieces are receiving appropriate investment, while the pieces that don't fit are being divested or shut down. For example, we have recently moved ABSXchange, European MarketScope and FMR Australia out of the portfolio. And we expect that as progress is made, this will become a higher-margin, faster-growing business segment.", "In June, S&P Capital IQ launched its new portfolio, Risk Solution, available through the Capital IQ Desktop. The product brings together leading risk and portfolio analytics acquired through last year's purchase of R2 Financial Technologies and Capital IQ's extensive market and reference data. This product is the only realtime, multi-asset portfolio risk system that enables internal and external collaboration, click-through transparency and seamless access to the broad range of reference data and functionality offered within the Capital IQ Desktop. This powerful tool provides traders and portfolio and risk managers with the ability to make decisions about pricing, hedging and capital management of multi-asset portfolios, including equities, fixed income and derivatives, all in realtime.", "Okay. With that, now let me turn to the Commodities & Commercial Markets segment. Revenue here grew 8% in the second quarter, and operating profit increased 16%, resulting in record operating margin of 31.8%. Platts delivered double-digit revenue growth, while J.D. Power and Aviation Week delivered single-digit growth.", "In Commodities, Platts recorded a 14% increase in revenue. Growth in petroleum product subscriptions continued to be the primary driver of this double-digit growth. In addition, licensing revenue from petroleum derivative trading increased more than 50%. Petroleum, petrochemicals, metals, agriculture product subscriptions all delivered double-digit revenue growth, while power and gas revenue were flat.", "Two new price assessments for China and Greater Asia were launched during the quarter. They are designed to complement each other by providing a quick and straightforward way for traders and other interested parties to compare the prices of domestic and imported thermal coal in the Chinese market and immediately determine whether there's a price arbitrage advantage favoring one type or the other.", "Over the past few years, the natural gas, oil and liquids markets have been transformed and revitalized by extraction innovations such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Deposits of gas and oil that were once cost-prohibitive or difficult to assess have now become cost effective and are having a profound effect on energy markets around the globe. The United States and Canada are at the center of this revolution, and the Platts North American Shale Plays Map presents a holistic view of an industry that profoundly altered our energy landscape. I cite this map because it provides a quick visual example of the breadth of data that Platts provides beyond pricing. That capability is increasingly important with the growing Marcellus Shale production of natural gas.", "Commercial Markets revenue increased 2% in the second quarter, with J.D. Power and Aviation Week both delivering single-digit revenue growth. Within J.D. Power, the Asian business drove a double-digit revenue increase in automotive, which was partially offset by reduced licensing from past award recipients. McGraw Hill Construction revenue continues to be pressured by the weak U.S. commercial construction market, with growth of new products unable to overcome declines in base business. And Aviation Week revenue increased, primarily due to the MRO Americas Show and the biennial Paris Air Show, which took place in the second quarter of 2013.", "As an example of the importance of the J.D. Power brand, GM is running numerous advertisements depicting the 8 recent J.D. Power Initial Quality Study awards that it received. As part of their advertising, last week, they wrapped a banner around their entire world headquarter with a picture of the 8 awards. We're very proud of that and very proud of them.", "And here, J.D. Power received its own award. It is celebrating its 45th year anniversary. In 1968, a wonderful individual, J.D. Power III, Dave, established J.D. Power from his kitchen table, with a primary focus on the automotive industry. Since that time, the company has successfully influenced the everyday lives of consumers and industries worldwide and has expanded to include offices throughout North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. And all of us here are so very, very proud of all of these accomplishments, so congratulations goes out all of our J.D. Power employees. Well done, everyone.", "And finally, as I mentioned previously, I'd like to again introduce McGraw Hill Financial's next President and CEO. After serving as President for 20 years, I can't believe it, after 20 years, and CEO for 15 years, it's great to have a successor of the caliber of Doug Peterson. Doug is not only a talented leader with profound industry knowledge, regulatory experience and, most importantly, unquestionable integrity. The transition is well underway. Doug and I are working through many issues, and Doug will officially begin his new position in November. And of course, after this transition, I will continue as Chairman of the Board.", "So let me, at this point, turn it over to Doug to make some remarks, and then after that, we can go in any direction anybody would like. Doug?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Thank you, Terry. I'm honored to be asked to lead this great company. Terry's passion, optimism and exceptional management of the company has positioned us to succeed going forward. Over the last 20 years, Terry has led this company with great success and consistent record of delivering shareholder value. Terry and the board had the vision to create McGraw Hill Financial with a focus on benchmarks, ratings and analytics. And now I look forward to leading this new, fast-growing financial intelligence company.", "Before I talk about this change in leadership, let me first review Standard & Poor's Rating Services results for the quarter and then take a few moments to share some thoughts about McGraw Hill Financial and my new role.", "After a strong first quarter, the business delivered an even stronger second quarter. Revenue for this segment grew 24%, setting a new all-time record for any quarter of $599 million, surpassing the previous mark set in the second quarter of 2007. Segment operating profit increased 34%, and the corresponding operating margin increased 330 basis points to more than 46%. The incremental revenue growth was the primary driver of the margin expansion.", "We note that issuance declined notably after Federal Reserve statements regarding consideration of changes to current stimulus policies were made in June. While the company expects global issuance to remain generally robust, interruptions in issuance could occur as markets contemplate possible interest rate increases.", "On our third quarter call last November, we shared a slide with you that showed high levels of corporate maturities that were coming due over the next several years and should support continued strong issuance, and we continue to publish research showing that information. On our fourth quarter call in February, we shared a slide with you that showed the European disintermediation opportunity. Today, I would like to share an interesting slide that depicts the correlation or, actually, lack thereof, of interest rate changes to global issuance. This slide shows 10 years of global issuance, with corporate issuance in blue, structured finance in green. The dash line is the average corporate issuance over this time period. The solid line depicts the average 10-year Treasury yield for each year. As interest rates rise, issuance actually increased. Then as interest rates declined, corporate issuance showed little change. This data and other research that we've performed shows that issuance in the last decade has not been correlated to changes in interest rates, and the issuance was more robust when interest rates were considerably higher than they are today. Frankly, there are many other forces that impact issuance, including spreads, liquidity, consumer sentiment, government policy and expected growth rates, to name just a few. We believe that if interest rates rise due to improvements in GDP growth and lower unemployment, it could be positive for issuance. However, that doesn't mean issuance won't be choppy as markets adjust to new rates. Therefore, due to upcoming corporate maturities, the European bank deleveraging opportunity and emerging market expansion, we remain optimistic about issuance levels over the next few years.", "Turning back to the quarter. Non-transaction revenue grew 12%, driven by increased entity credit rating and ratings evaluation services. Excluding the acquisition of Coalition, non-transaction revenue grew 9.9%. Growth in these products is an encouraging sign that new issuers could be coming to market.", "Transaction revenue increased 41% as a result of improved investment-grade and high-yield issuance, increased bank loan ratings and growth in U.S. CMBS and CDOs. Globally, growth was balanced. In fact, the revenue in each major region of the world that we track increased over 20%.", "This chart shows second quarter year-over-year increases in both the United States and Europe of 10% and 25%, respectively, in issuance. Total corporate issuance reflects an 85% increase in high yield and a 24% increase in investment grade. U.S. structured issuance increased, driven by a resurgence in CMBS and CDOs, and the CDO were primarily CLOs, which grew 70% and 48%, respectively. This chart also makes clear the fact that in both the United States and Europe, second quarter issuance declined, yet despite this decline, our revenue actually increased sequentially. This is due to growth in bank loan ratings, which are not included in issuance in this chart, entity credit ratings, ratings evaluation services and CRISIL.", "Some of you will have noticed that Standard & Poor's Ratings Services launched our first major advertising campaign in our history targeting U.S. markets. As part of the broader McGraw Hill Financial launch, our efforts are aimed at supporting our brand and educating stakeholders through outreach, thought leadership and strategic media placement, including print, online and radio. It's important that we proactively educate all our constituencies about our role and importance in the capital markets. Capital allows people to start and grow businesses, cities and states to build highways and hospitals and manufacturers to build factories, all of which lead to job creation.", "Now I'll make a few comments about McGraw Hill Financial and my upcoming role as President and CEO. McGraw Hill Financial promotes sustainable and orderly growth in the capital and commodity markets as the foremost provider of ratings, benchmarks and analytics to financial professionals and investors worldwide. The company has built an incredible set of businesses with iconic brands and leading-market positions. With such a great collection of assets, our solid balance sheet and our strong cash flow, I don't expect to need to make any major changes to our current strategy of portfolio. However, there can be no complacency for any business in this fast-changing world. We'll need to continue to upgrade the portfolios necessary and, most importantly, ensure that we invest cash wisely.", "First and foremost, before embarking on any changes, we will continue with a smooth and seamless transition. We need to put in place a new head of the Standard & Poor's Rating Services business. We have some excellent internal candidates and are looking outside the company as well. In the meantime, I will be meeting with investors, clients, public officials and employees in the coming months to discuss how McGraw Hill Financial can even better serve the financial markets.", "Some particular areas of focus will be on strategy and innovation, both at the business and enterprise level. We'll look at corporate governance, our regulatory environment and, very, very importantly, capital allocation.", "As we prepare for 2014, there are several key priorities to address. I need to make sure that we have a well-understood corporate vision and that our individual business strategies are aligned. There are important opportunities, both on the revenue and the cost side, for the businesses to work more closely together, and I'd like to ensure we understand and deliver these benefits.", "We are all committed to the core values of McGraw Hill Financial: fairness, integrity and transparency. Most importantly, I understand that we are the stewards of shareholders' assets and must maximize the return on their investment. To the people on this call, your investment.", "With that, let me now hand the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, for additional details on the financials. Thank you.", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. This morning, I want to briefly discuss several items on our performance and the outlook for 2013. First, I want to recap key financial metrics in the quarter and review the modest onetime costs that were incurred. Second, I will provide some additional detail related to the balance sheet and year-to-date cash flow. And finally, I will discuss share repurchase activity, our intent to increase our ownership of CRISIL and the recent divestiture of Aviation Week.", "As Terry just discussed, while our first quarter was strong, our second quarter was even better. Revenue grew 17% to $1.25 billion, with organic revenue growing 13%. Adjusted operating profit grew 29%, driven primarily by the strong results in Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Commodities & Commercial Markets. Adjusted unallocated expense increased 4%. Overall, the margin expansion was significant year-on-year, as consolidated adjusted operating profit margins increased over 300 basis points to 35.7%.", "The tax rate declined 250 basis points to 35%, while noncontrolling interests grew $20 million, both primarily due to the impact of the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture. The tax rate also benefited from certain ongoing tax planning activities.", "Adjusted net income from continuing operations increased 28%, and the impact of our accelerated share repurchases can be seen in the adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 31%.", "Our Growth and Value Plan costs continue to wind down. During the second quarter, we reported $10 million of costs related to professional fees and outsourcing.", "We continue to maintain an exceptionally strong balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and approximately $800 million of long-term debt. We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet going forward, balancing investments targeted at building the business and, as appropriate, returning cash to shareholders.", "Our free cash flow during the first 6 months was $145 million. This was negatively impacted year-on-year by 2 large items. First, because of Hurricane Sandy, the IRS allowed fourth quarter estimated tax payments that are normally made in December to be paid in February. This payment was $130 million and was paid in the first quarter. The second item was the $77 million payment associated with the legal settlement that was included in our first quarter results. Including the impact of these items, our operating cash flow guidance remains $650 million to $700 million.", "I am pleased to announce that the $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction was completed earlier this week. As we noted in our first quarter conference call, we received 8.6 million shares at the end of March. This week, we received an additional 700,000 shares to close out the transaction. In total, we repurchased 9.3 million shares at a volume weighted average price of $53.80 per share. And right now, approximately 7.6 million shares remain under our existing share repurchase authorization, and we plan to continue to repurchase shares in the open market as appropriate.", "During the quarter, we also announced plans to purchase up -- to purchase an additional 22% of the outstanding shares of CRISIL. CRISIL is the leading rating agency in India, and we currently own approximately 53% of the company. Earlier this week, on July 24, the company initiated the voluntary tender offer for up to 15.7 million shares. The tender will close on August 6. If the tender is fully subscribed, this would represent an additional investment of approximately $320 million at current exchange rates.", "And lastly, just yesterday, we announced the sale of Aviation Week to Penton, further increasing our focus on high-growth, high-margin benchmark businesses. The sale of Aviation Week will reduce the company's annualized revenue by almost $50 million per year. The bottom line impact will be minimal.", "Summing up, we have delivered an excellent first half, with 15% revenue growth and 31% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. We are a bit cautious about the balance of year growth due to issuance volatility and challenging second half year-on-year comparisons, especially in the fourth quarter. That being said, we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $650 million to $750 million, and we are raising our 2013 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to $3.15 to $3.25 per share. The first year of McGraw Hill Financial continues to look very promising.", "With that, let me now turn the call back over to Terry.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thanks, Jack. And again, we have indeed delivered excellent first half results. We're deploying cash into global ratings opportunities, as well as share repurchases. And we're continuing to refine our portfolio of high-growth, high-margin businesses.", "With that, let me end it there, and let's go to Q&A. We can go in any direction you'd like. And to give some instructions on how to ask your questions, let me turn it over to Chip to provide that. Chip?", "Robert S. Merritt", "All right, just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] And now, operator, we'll take the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from William Bird with Lazard.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "First, Terry and Doug, congratulations to each of you. A question on the outlook, what does guidance assume for stock buybacks and macro top context, particularly as it relates to S&P Ratings?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thanks, Bill. Let me come over to Jack on share repurchases. We obviously completed what we said we were going to do in terms of the $500 million in the first half. And as Jack was saying, we fully intend to complete the year continuing share repurchases, and we still have an authorization level out there and we'll go back to the board for more as seen fit. And just in terms of the ratings guidance in terms of an outlook, again, issuance, albeit that slowed a little bit in June, was awfully strong in April and May. We see no abatement in terms of the drive for capital demand, and therefore, issuance will be strong. Again, comparisons to last year are going to be a little bit of an issue, so we'll see how that goes from that standpoint. Let me ask Jack. Jack, do you want to add anything on the share repurchase?", "John F. Callahan", "Bill, we still have about 7.6 million shares under our existing authorization. That's about $400 million. We will selectively work through that over the balance of the year. Some part of that is included in our guidance but particularly starting to get in the back half of the year. Most of that has a bigger impact as you get into 2014.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, we've got a very strong commitment, Bill, to that. Let me -- Doug, do you want to add anything more in terms of issuance?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "On issuance, I've mentioned 2 additional factors. As we mentioned before, between the first quarter and second quarter, this had been very robust issuance. Although there are certain asset classes, an example is the European structured finance market has been down and with very, very low issuance, with the exception of covered bonds. The last few days into last week and this week, we've seen a resurgence of volume and a strong pipeline coming up, but that's a short-term view. With a longer-term view, we've published different works over the last 3 or 4 months looking at the longer-term pipeline of refinancing and growth needs. In the corporate issuance alone, between now and 2017, there's an $8.3 trillion of debt maturities that is outstanding. And whether that we see choppiness and how that comes into the markets, we'll have to watch carefully. But between the overall corporate financial institutions, government refinancing pipeline, which is large, the need for new capital and new investment, we see that there will be, in the medium term, a very robust issuance going into the markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I\u2019d also like to first congratulate Terry and Doug on their new roles. If I can start off on the C&C side, clearly, Platts continues to perform well, and I just wanted an update on the sort of the inquiries going on in Europe, like what was the latest that you guys have heard in terms of how that was proceeding.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Let me -- again, all of that is, as you say, proceeding, and we're very much on top of that. The fact that Ken Vittor, our General Counsel, is here, let me ask Ken. Would you talk on the Platts issue for a second?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Sure, Terry. We were a party to an inspection by the EC in May, as were many other parties. No allegations of wrongdoing have been made against Platts. We are cooperating with the regulators, and this is the initial stage of this proceeding. We are planning to make a presentation to the EC early in the fall, probably in September, to lay out the Platts MOC process and how we go about assessing prices and doing our reporting activities. So it's very early stages, and that matter will go on for some time.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then in the margin performance, the division was obviously very impressive. Was that driven mainly by, I guess, the transactional increase on the Platts side? And then looking forward, like how sustainable is that level? And also, I guess, taking into account Aviation Week, which seems like it didn't have much of a margin contribution there, like balancing those 2, like how should we think about what's the sustainability of that margin is?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, I mean, at this point, Manav, I think it's very sustainable. Platts business is very strong. We're getting increased contributions from McGraw Hill Construction and J.D. Power as well -- J.D. Power, especially, in terms of its success in China. And as we expand into more geographic regions with that, I think that's going to be very sustainable with not as much investment dollars as some other areas. So I think it's very supportable at that level.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And if I can just sneak in one last on the rating agency side and sort of margin related as well, it seems like, sequentially, it was about the same, year-over-year, improved nicely. Is it fair to characterize most of that year-over-year improvement due to the sort of the reentrance into the CMBS market based on last year?", "John F. Callahan", "Manav, I think that's a contributor. I think it certainly helps as we get some stepped-up revenue on that part of the business. But I would also -- we've also had very strong growth on the corporate side. So the revenue is -- being as robust as it is, it's certainly incrementally profitable. But the business has also done a very good job in controlling year-on-year expense growth, particularly as it relates to headcount additions. So I would say it's a combination of very strong top line fundamentals, combined with prudent management of costs.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just maybe starting, going back to the product portfolio, I guess it sounds like, Doug, you'll give us a little bit more detail going forward, but obviously, Aviation Week is getting -- you're leaving that business, I guess. What else is in the product portfolio right now? Is anything more non-core that you're looking at a little bit harder to maybe not as good of a fit anymore? And then on the other side, I think you said there might be still room for some tuck-in acquisitions. So first of all, in terms of tuck-in, what do you mean in terms of size? And then secondly, what kind of areas do you think interests you in particular?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Well, Alex, first of all, we don't comment on any aspect within the portfolio pending or anything like that. We're very committed to the businesses that we're in. The nice aspect for Aviation Week is that I think it's a particularly strong strategic fit and an excellent home with Penton Media. And of course, they have an aviation business as well. So there's a very nice fit there. But no, we obviously are always looking at the portfolio and -- but there's nothing further at this point to discuss that way. In terms of tuck-in acquisitions, remember now, for the most part, and we're very proud of this because of the talent that we have, the majority of our businesses are organic businesses. And we've taken them in terms of changes in market and have been able to transform certain aspects and the like. But for the most part, they're there. Now we will always continue to be active in the market for tuck-ins, small -- smaller acquisitions in size, that bring new skill sets or capabilities to us. And I mentioned a couple of them, QuantHouse, R2, CMA for Capital IQ. But Jack was talking about the additional tendering opportunity in CRISIL. We like those opportunities a lot. And through globalization and the expansion of capital markets around the world and the introduction of new bond markets and the like, we plan to be very aggressive in terms of being able to expand our global footprint. So tuck-in acquisitions that give us new skill sets or capabilities are always important to us. But -- and for the most part, our businesses are organically driven.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "All right, fair enough. And secondly, maybe just talk a little bit more about the outlook for Capital IQ. Yes, I don't think there has been a lot of focus here in the prepared remarks. So first of all, I think client user growth continues pretty nicely. I think the organic growth is decent, but maybe you can talk a little bit more about the outlook there in terms of the hiring market seems to be looking a little bit better, both on the sell side and the buy side. And then obviously, with the new product offering on the risk analytics, maybe just a little bit of color of what you've heard so far in terms of early interest in the product and then also how you think you can compete with your competitors there.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. We're obviously very excited about the prospects of Capital IQ going forward. And we took a little bit of a step-back in terms of the acquisitions of those 3 capabilities, QuantHouse, R2 and CMA, from the -- from last year in all of that. But all of that was done to accelerate the top line. And you're exactly right, customer acquisition is what it's all about. And we have been able to provide some tremendous traction there, and that will accelerate the top line. We still have a little bit of year-over-year comparisons to get through in terms of the second half, but we fully expect that the investments that we've made and the continued customer acquisition will get us to a much higher level.", "John F. Callahan", "Yes, sort of in looking forward, it is our hope, with the benefits from these new product introductions, by the time we at least get to the fourth quarter, we'll see maybe some modest pickup in top line growth and would set us up for a stronger year of top line growth as we get into 2014. We're in the midst of -- we've been planning around, but more of the specifics of that next year.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great, great. And just maybe lastly, on the ratings side, maybe this is a little bit too detailed, but when I look at market share in high yield, it looks like you lost a little bit of ground in the last few months here. And I think there were a couple of high-profile deals that you weren't actually on as far as we can tell. So just wondering, I mean, is there anything different in the competitive environment that you're seeing, in particular, as it relates to high yields that we should be aware of?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "No, Alex, we're not losing any market share in high yield. In fact, it's pretty aggressive. But given that Doug is here, Doug, do you want to add anything to that?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "The only thing I'd add is we have -- we've not seen any specific slip in market share. We have very strong issuance throughout the quarter. And as you've seen, our pickup back into the Structured Finance market, in particular with CMBS and CLOs, has been quite successful. So I don't have any additional comments on that.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "No, and bank loan ratings as well...", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Bank loan ratings as well.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, bank loan ratings has been very good on that part.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Again, it's fair enough. And we can follow up on the specific deals as we go on. Just to squeeze in one for Jack real quick, just want to make sure I've heard you correct on your response on the share buybacks earlier. You basically said that 7.6 million should be extinguished by the remainder -- by the end of the year. Is that -- did I hear that right?", "John F. Callahan", "We have that possibility. I wouldn't be -- we'll work that in as we go through the year, depending on market conditions. But unless we get an additional authorization, that would certainly be the maximum we could do this year.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "That would be the plan.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.", "Craig Huber", "Want to focus first on your non-transaction revenue within your Ratings business, up about 11.5%. I'd be curious to hear what drove that. And also, could you talk about this change in billing that your press release talked about, like can you quantify that for us and when did that part start, that change start?", "John F. Callahan", "Could you repeat the second part of that question, Craig?", "Craig Huber", "You mentioned in your press release that there was a change in the billing of your non-transaction revenue in Ratings. I'd be curious when that actually started, and can you quantify that positive impact against ...?", "John F. Callahan", "Okay, going back to the high level, first of all, there is impact in there from the Coalition acquisition at CRISIL. This, I think, is about 2 points of growth. Another major driver of the growth is the strong growth in new entity ratings, new companies coming to market for a rating. And there's been some -- the point in terms of the release, there's been, over time, some restructuring in terms of some of -- the ways certain things are built between that impact, the non-transaction. I believe that worked its way into the market -- worked our way into about a year ago. So I think this is essentially the last quarter where we'd have a significant year-on-year benefit. Obviously, we have that now, change, moving forward, but I doubt it will make a significant a contributor to growth in future quarters.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, and again, Craig, as the release stated, non-transaction revenue increased 12% and represented 52% of S&P Ratings' total revenue. And I'd compare that 52% to 58% from the same period last year.", "Craig Huber", "Did this billing change -- sorry to belabor this, but did it add a few percentage points of growth year-over-year here?", "John F. Callahan", "It made a contribution.", "Craig Huber", "Okay. For the whole company, what was the incentive compensation for the second quarter, and what was it in the first quarter, please?", "John F. Callahan", "Craig, we really haven't gone in the past to be that explicit in the past. It's not a -- I would say, though, in terms of year-on-year comparisons year-to-date, it's modestly up this year, so it is a bit dilutive to growth. But...", "Robert S. Merritt", "But Jack, you might want to put it in the context of last year, how we'd calendarize this over the quarters as this year seems to be a little bit more upfront.", "John F. Callahan", "This year is a bit more balanced than last year. Last year was -- because our performance really kind of zoomed up in the third and fourth quarter, the timing of incentive compensation year-on-year kind of fettered in more in the third, particularly the fourth quarter of 2012. This year, kind of we're off to a stronger start than anticipated. I think -- I do suspect the year-on-year accruals right now may be a bit more front-end loaded, and we don't anticipate as significant an increase in incentive accruals in the third and fourth quarter that we saw last year.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Craig, if you want to circle back with Chip, we'll give you some specific numbers on that for what we've got.", "Craig Huber", "So if I could just ask on the DOJ case, is your sense if this thing does actually go to trial, if you're thinking roughly 3 years out from when it first became public knowledge in early February?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, the only thing that I would say on DOJ -- and again, remember, the judge was very explicit, and he didn't want this going back and forth in media circles or public circles and all of those things, so we, obviously, are going to honor that -- let me just say that we look forward to getting our side of the story out there and the facts and figures on this thing, and we feel very confident and comfortable with that.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Let me just add that...", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "This is Ken Vittor, General Counsel.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Thanks, Terry. The time is not clear yet because the government still has to decide what case it will be bringing. It needs to narrow and specify the case in its current form. We are unable to advise the court, and the court would be unable to set it as firm trial date because we don't know yet what the case is going to look like. As it is, we find and narrowed, and there's a status conference on Monday, the 29th, to begin that process of how to shape the pretrial phase of the case. We'll be better able to give you a timeline. But right now, it's still dependent on the government refining its allegation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Jack, in the last couple quarters, or at least last quarter, I think you talked about some orphaned cost leftover from the Education divestiture. I'm wondering what the -- what's left there with the magnitude of that overhang might be. And then on the growth and value costs, restructuring costs, you noted that those numbers are going down. Should we continue to expect some costs in the third and fourth quarter?", "John F. Callahan", "Yes, Peter, in terms of -- look, we came into the year of Education with stranded costs in the range of $20 million to $25 million. They're still in our run rate, so we have yet -- but we are working on those. But I suspect that we'll -- it'll take us some time as we get into 2014 to really address those more fully. So we're still overcoming those stranded costs right now in our performance. And in terms of relative to Growth and Value Plan costs, I'd probably right now point you towards some continuation of those costs, but I would keep them at the more modest stand like we've seen here now in the second quarter of approximately $10 million as we're working through the final stages of some of our outsourcing activities that relate to some of the decisions that we took last year.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And Terry or Doug, the decision to increase the ownership of CRISIL, I understand the appeal of that business given its very rapid growth. But what are the strategic benefits to you of going from the roughly 50% to 70-ish percent? And is there a road map that could take you to 100%?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, I mean, again, it's a public company. And as a public company, once you start getting above 75%, you're going to be in issues of delisting and things like that. So we are very, very excited about CRISIL, and it is performing extremely well in a marketplace that is going to be we're adding, what, $1 trillion of infrastructure over the next 5 years and all the financing mechanisms associated with that. It also represents a launchpad for other geographic expansion outside of India. So we are very excited about it. And we're in a tender offer period at this point and probably shouldn't comment any further on that, but very excited about it.", "John F. Callahan", "Just for context, Peter, this -- our previous -- our last investment of CRISIL, probably, if you look at it, it probably has delivered a 10x return when we went from about 9% ownership to over 50%. It may be one of the best investments this company has ever made. So that's just a little bit of historical context. But beyond sort of this -- the financial criteria, increasingly, we're just doing more working together. And I think with the increased ownership, it just gets easier as we kind of work together to broaden up the business, both within India and more broadly. But right now, it's very clear, it is our long-term intent to maintain it as an independent, public company in India, which means our ownership is maxed out at that 75% level. So that's what we're targeting.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And last thing, the -- if I've done this calculation correctly, I think the full year EPS guidance would suggest that you're going to be up somewhere between 0% and 7% in the second half. I obviously understand the comp issue with S&P. Are there any other things you would call out in terms of variables here in the second half in terms of year-to-year comps that would drive some slower growth?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, it's just the math impact of now it was the end of the third quarter when we will now have the JV and will now have been formed for over a year, so that will now -- you'll get, I think, a more complete view of the JV. It'd be more apples-to-apples comparison, obviously, because it's -- it was only -- it was formed in the early third quarter of a year ago. So that's just -- but that's just the math impact of it. I think you're raising the big point, which is just the extraordinarily difficult overlap that we have, particularly in the fourth quarter, led by ratings. So I think that's -- in the current environment, that just gives us some caution as we look at the balance of the year.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "And as always, Peter, as we go, we'll be looking at it very hard, and we'll give you any kind of guidance that we see as we go.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Arthur with Evercore.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Yes, just on Dow Jones Indices, I'm trying to reconcile the sort of pro forma growth of 6% with the -- you cite assets under management, x Dow Jones Indices, up 34% and trading volume up -- of derivatives up 11%. So where -- what's missing in that puzzle?", "John F. Callahan", "Yes, that's a good question. Just a couple points. One, as it relates to assets under management, in our contracts, there is let's call them some break points. As more assets under management are returning, it goes down a little bit. As you'd expect, there's sort of a volume discount. That's one. Two, we -- these -- we are paid not on assets under management end of the quarter but how it builds, how it averages in over the course of the quarter. And also, see, there's some noise in the second quarter, and I think you'll see that -- it'll be clearer as we get into the third. There was some benefits of some contract negotiations a year ago that we were able to retrospectively recognize some revenue a year ago. That's suppressing the year-on-year growth rate. As you get into the third and fourth quarter, based on, at least right now, what we're seeing on assets under management, we think this business is going to have pretty strong balance of your top line growth in aggregate of double-digit growth in both the third and fourth quarter if assets under management stay in this range. So I think we'll get this noise behind us, and it'll be a bit clearer as we move forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.", "Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So my first question is on CRISIL. Can you just talk about how you think of using cash to increase your stake in CRISIL versus other options, whether that's share repurchases or anything else that you might look at and, obviously, keeping in mind that, I think, the cash that you are going to use for that is held from your non-U.S. subsidiaries?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, it's always, obviously, a balancing of considerations in all of that. And Patrick, I can't state any more clearly how enthusiastic we are and excited about the share repurchase program we have in place and what we've been able to accomplish to date in all of that. But the opportunity for CRISIL using offshore cash was particularly welcoming because of what we wanted to do and what we want to represent in that marketplace.", "John F. Callahan", "Look, I would just add, the first place you want to deploy capital is building up our core business. And at our core, CRISIL is a rating agency and with a global business. And so the first place we're going to deploy capital is to build out that network. And I would just reiterate a point I made earlier, our last investment CRISIL, which was, I think, only 8 years ago, to date has delivered from -- at the expansion -- relative to the expansion of the market capitalization of CRISIL, it has delivered roughly a 10x return. So those -- we'll do those all day long, and you should expect us to continue if there's not that many opportunities where we can deploy capital of this magnitude in the Ratings business. I wish there were more, but we saw this as a great opportunity, particularly kind of given the formation of the new company.", "Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Understand. And then last one for me, and I apologize if you already talked about this. But with the record quarter for S&P Ratings, I would've expected a little bit of operating margin expansion, but it's pretty much flat quarter-over-quarter. Can you kind of talk about the margin in that business and what drove cost sort of higher this quarter and kind of what we should expect going forward?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, I mean, we're actually quite pleased. We've had now 2 conservative quarters of mid-40s margins, which has been pretty good expansion relative to where we were. Our overall expense control relative to headcount adds has been quite good, particularly kind of given the amount of business that has come in. And so I think there is -- maybe there -- the business is doing so well. There is some impact year-on-year as it relates to incentive compensation. But all in all, the business is doing a very good job of managing its costs. And we continue to both -- we hear the opportunity and margins going forward, but that is the balance of both top line growth and managing of the overall cost base.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Reynolds with Jefferies.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just one question from me. I wondered if you could talk about Capital IQ and the proprietary research business. There seemed to be some comments suggesting that it was a difficult quarter. I just wondered what you saw in that domain in terms of the longer-term view.", "John F. Callahan", "We did lose a bit of business there, so it was dilutive to the growth rate to some degree. But we like that business, and we are trying to like -- are trying to rethink a little bit how we did this on a global business. So we don't have all the answers right now, but it's an area of some focus for us right now as we start to get ready for 2014. But we do think it's an interesting piece of our overall portfolio, not a big one, but an interesting little piece.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Ed Atorino with Benchmark.", "Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Terry, you may have covered this circumventionally, something like that. You're getting to be a good size in financial services. You are concentrated in a couple of areas. Do you see the need to sort of diversify and make some acquisitions to sort of broaden the base in the financial service area?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, Ed, again, in terms of the whole notion of data content, benchmarks, analytics, we obviously are looking at all things that could be constructive to the portfolio. At this point, I would suggest that if we are doing any acquisitions, they're going to be relatively small, and they're going to give us different skills or capabilities that would enhance our portfolio. The portfolio now is largely organic-driven, and we're very excited about that because of the talent that we have and those kind of capabilities. There are no plans at this point for expansion. We are very focused on share repurchase. We're very focused on strategic things, like the tender opportunity with CRISIL.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call.

Sir, you may begin.", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you and good morning and thank everyone for joining us here at The McGraw-Hill Companies third quarter 2006 earnings conference call. I am Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations of The McGraw-Hill Companies. With me today are Harold McGraw, III, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Robert Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the corporation.", "This morning we issued a news release with our third quarter 2006 results.

Today's update will last approximately an hour. After the presentations, we will open the meeting to questions and the answers.", "Now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President, and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw. ", "Harold McGraw, III", "Okay. Thank you very much, Don. And good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for a review today of The McGraw-Hill Companies third quarter results. As Don mentioned joining us on the conference call today is Bob Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the company. And we will start today's call by reviewing the performance of our businesses and take a look at the outlook for the rest of the year. Then Bob Bahash will review our financial performance and also talk about expectations for completing the year 2006. And as Don said, afterwards as always we'll answer any questions and we can go in any direction that you'd like. ", "Earlier this morning, we announced third quarter results. Diluted earnings per share increased 6% to $1.06 and that included $0.03 for incremental stock-based compensation and $0.03 for restructuring business operations. I'll chat about that in a moment a little bit more and Bob Bahash will also address that. Net income for the third quarter was $382.3 million and revenue rose to $2 billion for the quarter. ", "As a result of this performance, we are again increasing our guidance for the year. Our previous earnings guidance called for earnings per share of $2.44 to $2.49 and that excluded the incremental impact of all stock-based compensation; that excluded $0.13 for the stock-based compensation and $0.04 for the one-time charge for the elimination of the restoration stock option program.", "Our new guidance for 2006 calls for earnings per share of $2.53 to $2.55 and that excludes again the incremental impact of all stock-based compensation and restructuring charges. The incremental impact at the stock-based compensation has been revised to $0.11 down from the estimate of $0.13 earlier this year, and as we have previously stated and for the full year 2007, we fully expect to achieve double-digit earnings growth. ", "With that let's take a closer look at how we achieved our third quarter results and the steps that we are taking to prepare for 2007. Let's begin with The McGraw-Hill Education. In this year's softer market, we worked very hard to protect the bottom-line. Two major swing factors, more limited opportunities in 2006 after last year's robust growth, and stringent cost controls are reflected in the segment's third quarter results. Revenue decreased by 6.3%, operating profit declined by 7 and that includes $3.4 million for incremental stock-based compensation, but our operating margin at 33.1%, was virtually unchanged from last year's, which was 33.3%.", "That achievement reflects our determination to manage costs in a weaker state new adoption market this year. For the education segment in the third quarter, cost declined by 6% compared to last year and that\u2019s after a pre-tax restructuring charge of $5.6 million primarily for the integration of our elementary and secondary basal publishing business, and $3.4 million for the incremental stock-based compensation expenses that I just mentioned a moment ago. ", "We took a number of steps to manage cost in the third quarter. In anticipation of the restructuring of our basal publishing businesses, we sharply curtailed hiring, we also cut marketing and sampling costs in anticipation of this year's softer state new adoption market, and we also worked very hard to achieve a higher level of operational efficiency, the benefits of the new global transformation platform should be greater in periods of peak activity and they were in 2006. ", "As we have pointed out, the year-to-year market shift is pronounced in The McGraw-Hill School Education Group. In 2005 The McGraw-Hill School Education Group increased third quarter revenue by 18.9% in a very strong market. One of the keys to last year's successes was an outstanding performance in Texas, which accounted for $46 million in third quarter new adoption revenue. There is no adoption this year in Texas and that clearly was an important factor in the 12% decline in third quarter revenue this year at The McGraw-Hill School Education Group. ", "There were other factors as well. This is an off year in the state new adoption cycle; in 2006, it if off 30% or approximately $250 million, which obviously limits the potential. We also fell short of expectations with our elementary products in the Florida Science and the California Social Studies adoptions. We took only 4% of the elementary market in Florida and 15% of the market in California, but that\u2019s not the whole story. Our secondary science programs took 39% of the Florida market, and they were also very successful in Alabama, New Mexico, Oklahoma and West Virginia. ", "In California, we captured 32% of the middle school and 43% of the high school market for Social Studies. We successfully introduced Treasures; this is our new elementary reading program and designed in for this year in the open territory. Spotlight on Music, an elementary program was the market leader in the Indiana and Oregon. Our alternative basal math program, which is Everyday Mathematics, also demonstrated year-over-year growth with particular strength in the open territory. ", "Still this is going to be a soft year in the school education business. Through eight months, industry sales were down six-tenths of 1% and that\u2019s according to the Association of American Publishers (NYSE:AAP). We think the industry at best match last year's sales, but could be off as much as 4%. Texas will be an important factor in year-over-year comparisons because the state placed substantial orders in the third and fourth quarters last year, and as I said, there is no Texas adoption in 2006.", "Of course, comparisons do get easier next year with about a 15% increase in the state new adoption market in 2007. We took another step to gear up for those new opportunities in August by integrating our Elementary and Secondary Basal Publishing businesses. That new combination improves our efficiency, leverages our talent and will enhance our new product development, and those procedures are all well underway and doing well. There is a growing market demand for greater continuity in terms of curriculum design of instructional materials across all grade levels. We will be in a better position to respond to this demand because there will be a more comprehensive approach and greater continuity in product development efforts at our newly integrated publishing centers. We are creating very good pipeline -- a very good pipeline of new products in anticipation of the new opportunities. I've already mentioned the success this year in the open territory of our new elementary reading program, Treasures. That\u2019s a very good record to build on as we prepare for major new adoptions in reading.", "We are also encouraged by the reception of Real Math. This is our new skills oriented math program. It has already won a number of small and medium-size adoptions. Also, two new literature products, Reading with Purpose for the middle school and The Reader's Choice for high school, were completed in the spring for submission to adoption states for purchase in 2007. These programs have already captured some business in the open territory, and we\u2019re excited about their prospects going into next year.", "Jamestown Reading Navigator, which is a new online intervention program for secondary school students was not fully released until May of this year, but is already capturing new business because many students are still entering middle and high school, without achieving a reading proficiency, and of course, Jamestown Reading Navigator can adjust the reading capabilities to any level of student proficiency. Intervention products like this represent an important new category. The market for them has broadened as educators seek to meet the early progress goals, and these are the goals created by the No Child Left Behind Act. The fact is that many children, especially from urban districts, start school without the vocabulary, or for that matter, the number skills needed to deal with standard primary grade instruction. Efforts to address these needs often known as Response To Intervention or RTI programs have developed around the country. Our school group is offering a growing array of solutions to help educators deal with these kinds of issues. A new K-8 math program, Mathematics Connect is well along and we will have national as well as state specific editions ready for next year. As we know that Georgia is going to be having a very large K-12 math adoption; Texas in the 6-12 math as well for next year.", "Most adoptions as for next year would not be official until they receive State Board of Education approval, which usually comes next month. However, many state evaluation committees have already announced their recommendations. So, while we don\u2019t have the final word, we believe that our products, which are key to next year's sales, will be approved without difficulty. In short, we have the new organizational structure in place; we have an extensive list of new and revised products to address this emerging trend that is K-12 market.", "In educational testing, we continue to see pressure on operating margins even as we invest in technology to improve efficiency. In the third quarter, we saw decrease in our off the shelf sales of norm reference tests and reduced custom contract work. Partially offsetting this softness were our innovative personalized study guides, which have been adopted in Texas and Arizona, and this coming by way of the acquisition of the Grow Networks.", "Our Higher Education, Professional and International group grew by 2.2% in the third quarter, is up by 3% after nine months. In the U.S. college and university market, revenue in the third quarter was up for only one major imprint, that was the Science, Engineering and Math, but this is also our largest list for this year. We expect only modest growth from our Business and Economics group, because this is an off-cycle revision year for that imprint. The Humanities, Social Science and Languages imprint was off modestly for the third quarter. It now appears likely that the U.S. college and university market will grow about 3% this year instead of the 5% originally anticipated. ", "We still expect to outperform the market. A key factor will be our fall release of new products. We are also encouraged by the growth of our digital products for professional markets. India's largest technical university association will make our online digital engineering library available to 88 engineering schools. In Australia, a consortium of university libraries added AccessMedicine for 17 universities. These web-based subscription products clearly are growing global opportunities.", "Okay. Summing up for The McGraw-Hill Education, stringent cost controls protected the bottom line in a soft education market, and we are very pleased about the progress that we made there. Our secondary school products captured significant share and key adoption states this year. We have strengthened the el-hi organization by restructuring our basal business and that is for the most part complete. Comparisons will be challenging again in the fourth quarter. Again last year, the School Education Group had the benefit of $44 million of Texas revenue and grew by 23.6%. Margins in the testing business remained under pressure as we move more into the formative side from the summative side where the new growth opportunities exist. And the U.S. college and university market now looks like it will grow about 3% this year and we expect to outperform it. ", "Okay, let's move on to the Financial Services segment. In financial services, solid performances across our diversified portfolio of fixed income and equity products and services produced another record quarter in financial services. Revenue increased 11.4%, but excluding $33 million from Corporate Value Consulting, which was sold at the end of September in 2005, revenue was up 17.9% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating profits grew by 17.3% and that includes $8 million for incremental stock-based compensation. The operating margin for the third quarter expanded to 43.8%, up from 41.6 for the comparable quarter last year and our operating margin for the nine months is 44.1, up from 41.9 last year. ", "Now this is the expansion this year stems from a higher drop through from increased revenue and ratings, improvement in our data and information products and services where in acquisitions like Capital IQ had performed so well and are ahead of schedule, the expansion of our index products and services and cost controls and timing of expenditure. ", "Creating a diversified and resilient portfolio that is not dependent on any one asset class or market has been our strategic goal as we've been talking about for many, many years. We will continue to work on that objective, but the progress we have already made is apparent in the results, in the face of declining dollar volume issuance in the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities and the public finance market and only a modest increase in the U.S. asset-backed securities. ", "There were many global growth drivers in the third quarter; structured finance and corporates, very strong; rating products and services that are not tied to new issuance continues to grow and as a percentage of revenues continues to go up; data and information products and services is doing quite well; index services and products also; international credit ratings and services accounted for 39% of ratings revenue in the third quarter and that\u2019s up from 36.7% last year and as we have stated many times, our non-U.S. revenues are growing at a faster rate obviously than our U.S. growth and we are very encouraged by that.", "Structured finance was the global pace setter. We saw strong investor demand for cash flow and synthetic collateralized debt obligations; dollar volume issuance was up 118.7% in the U.S. and a 122.9% in Europe, tremendous growth. In the United Sates, growth in cash flow sector of CDOs was driven by high yield collateralized loan obligations and collateralized debt obligations of asset-backed security transaction. Hybrid transaction, this is a combination of cash flow and synthetics are driving the synthetic issuance. ", "In Europe there is a strong investor appetite for cash collateralized debt obligations, particularly the leveraged loan collateralized debt obligation products. It's worth noting that an increasing numbers of deals in Europe are coming from the U.S. based managers who are targeting a European loan market. They believe the European loan market offers more attractive spreads than the United States.", "We also saw strength in the U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities market. Issuance has been strong due to the historically low interest rate environment, which is driving commercial originations and refinancing of maturing deals. There is demand for these instruments especially among life insurance companies and foreign investors. We started noting this about a year and a half ago with the increases on the commercial side and it has been quite strong and it has done well. ", "As we pointed out earlier, the United States residential mortgage-backed securities market is starting to slow down. These are the year-over-year comparisons now. Dollar volume issuance declined about 11.2% in the third quarter and is up 6.6% through the nine months of this year. The number of deals that came to market in the third quarter was up 1.7% from the same period last year and for nine months the number of deals is up 18.8%. Activity in the United States has been driven primarily by the Alt-A sector and the refinancing of adjustable rate mortgages. ", "We continue to benefit from the increased number and the mix of deals issued in the non-agency market. In Europe, residential mortgage-backed securities dominate the securitization market. In the third quarter, residential mortgage-backed security dollar issuance grew by a 190.5% versus the same period last year, very, very strong. A buoyant European housing market is obviously a key to the continued strong deal flow there. ", "In the asset-backed securities market, it\u2019s the same areas that we have been seeing strengthened for the last several years; autos, credit card receivables, student loans remained the primary drivers. As auto manufacturers have recognized their businesses in recent months or rather reorganized their businesses in recent months, they have curtailed securitization. That will continue to be a factor in this market. ", "In Europe, the asset-backed securities market is far less matured than the United States and new issuers are still entering that market. The corporate market was strong in the United States, and it was very strong overseas. International markets were up solidly in the third quarter, and this is coming from a booming M&A activity and strong financing activity that have been driving this.", "In the United States, insurance companies and pension funds have been snapping up new issues as 5- and 10-year bonds in their portfolios are maturing. Foreign investors also active here; many are from nations flush with cash from oil markets. They are looking for a safe place to put their funds. The speculative grade market has been very weak, but a combination of historically low interest rates and active merger and acquisition market, and multi-million dollar buyout has stimulated leveraged financing in the bank loan market. Leveraged loans are replacing high yield bonds and taking a bigger piece of the capital structure. The growth of the bank loan market is one important reason, ratings and services not tied to the new issue market continue to expand, and in the third quarter, it represented 23.4% of ratings revenue, up from 21.6 last year. And this is a trend that we expect to see to continue, and we will continue to push very aggressively to offer products and services in this non-traditional area; and that net number will continue to grow.", "The growth of global financial markets is also stimulating new demand for our data and information products in both fixed income and equity market. We\u2019re attracting new customers and selling more capabilities to existing customers. This is basically a subscription business, so growth here adds to the stability of the revenue stream.", "We're continuing to add information and functionality to the web-based platform developed by Capital IQ, very pleased with the progress here. In the past few months, we've added real-time data, credit research and global corporate issuer ratings from S&P and macroeconomic time series. And again, we are very pleased with our progress here, and we can talk about that a little more, the revenue growth is well ahead of where we were expecting.", "We are also continuing to build our index products and services. Assets under management in exchange-traded funds based on S&P indexes grew to $147.1 billion by the end of September; that's a 23.5% increase compared to the same period last year. 25 new exchange-traded funds have been launched in the United States market so far this year with four different sponsors and there are more upcoming.", "We forecasted double-digit top and bottom line growth for financial service operations for the year and for the second half. That excludes revenue from the divestiture of Corporate Value Consulting and the impact of the incremental stock-based compensation and we are on course to achieve those results.", "In looking at the fourth quarter, the structured finance pipeline still looks very healthy. We expect strength in the collateralized debt obligation, a very large market and getting better, and the commercial mortgage-backed securities markets, which we've seen for the last couple of years, now gaining strength.", "U.S. residential mortgage-backed security issuance in the fourth quarter is expected to decline the year-over-year comparisons; the absolute volume is still quite high. Corporate still look very solid, and again, both here and outside of the United States. And the leveraged loan market will continue to be strong and international issuance looks very good.", "Let me also comment for a moment on the current regulatory outlook for the credit rating agencies. We have said all along that we expected no material adverse reaction on our business and that is certainly the case now that President Bush has signed into law this Credit Rating Agency Reform Act. The next step is obviously for the SEC to engage in rule making and implement the legislation in all part. S&P will continue to work with the SEC. We have very good relationships there. We believe that the version that was finally signed into law on September 29 was much more constructive than the original measure that was passed by the House, the Senate bill was essentially, the consensus bill that was passed.", "We see four major areas here that we are very pleased with. The SEC has not injected firstly into the analytical process or criteria or the methodology that credit agencies use to arrive at their opinion and that\u2019s good. The second one is that the new legislation does not diminish rights, including First Amendment protection S&P already possesses under applicable laws. The third one is that new firms now registering to become \"NRSRO,\" the Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organization, they must provide evidence that capital market participants regard them as issuers of quality credit period. And finally, the law preempts regulation by individual states. So, it\u2019s a very clean and clear posture.", "Okay. So, let me sum up then for Financial Services overall, another double-digit growth year is taking shape. Solid growth overseas and we are going to continue to see that in the years ahead. Strong performances in the structured and corporate market, excellent growth in the data and information businesses, continued strength in indexes and the expansion of the operating margin.", "Okay, let's move now to the information and media segment. In the information and media segment growth in higher value added information products and services and a pickup in business-to-business advertising were evident in the third quarter results for this segment. Revenue was up 8%, operating profits improved 10.3% and that includes $2.7 million for incremental stock-based compensation. ", "The segment incurred a pre-tax restructuring charge in the third quarter of $5.7 million and this was for employee severance costs for elimination of 100 positions across the segment. Nevertheless, we managed a modest increase in the operating margin for the quarter increasing it to 5.5%. ", "Revenue from the business-to-business group was up 9.9%. J.D. Power & Associates was a major factor here, producing top-line growth in both domestic and international products. Again about 25% of their business' revenue is outside the United States where two-thirds of that is in the all important Asia-Pacific region. Both the automotive and the financial service products were strong performers. ", "We are continuing to grow in the energy market. For many years, Platts products had successfully served the physical energy market. In recent years, we've been adding customers who are focused on the financial aspects of the energy market. Like the energy producers and traders, they want real-time information on volatile markets and they want Platts' price assessments. ", "Today four major energy exchanges, that would be The New York Mercantile Exchange, The Intercontinental Exchange, The Tokyo Commodities Exchange and The Singapore Exchange, all used Platts' prices and price assessments to clear trade. Platts' prices are used to settle $15 billion in global petroleum transactions every day. ", "The ad picture was mixed in the third quarter. We saw a pick up in business-to-business advertising, which helped offset a decline in national and local times sales at broadcasting. Revenue of broadcasting was up 5.9% to $26 million in the third quarter; that was primarily due to the loss of Monday Night Football in all of our markets and also Oprah in San Diego and in Denver, which is affecting fourth quarter pacing. As of October 13, fourth quarter pacing is up just about 1%, but we expect some improvement as political advertising is booked; that number looks to be somewhere around political advertising number for this year about $12 million. ", "Typically, political advertising is placed late, so stay tuned. Ad pages at Business Week were up 7.6% in the third quarter as measured by Publishers Information Bureau, (PIB). After nine months Business Weeks' ad pages were essentially flat, they were off about 1.7%. Businessweek.com continues to build traffic and contributed 13.1% of Business Week's total advertising revenue in the third quarter; we are very pleased with that. Ad Week's hotlist of websites listed Businessweek.com as one of the top 10 performers in 2006. Business Week also recently launched a mobile addition, the URL is Businessweek.Mobi. ", "Summing up the Information and Media segment, growth in higher value added information products, J.D. Power & Associates continues to perform exceptionally well; Platts is showing very strong performance and a pick-up in business-to-business advertising. And therefore summing up for the company overall now; as I pointed out earlier, we increased -- we are increasing earnings guidance again for 2006. Our new range now is $2.53 to $2.55 and I want to spend just a moment, and I will point out what is excluded and included. That guidance excludes now the, again, all of the incremental impact of the stock-based compensation and a $0.06 restructuring charge of which we'll have $0.03 in the third quarter and $0.03 in the fourth quarter. Those are the components that are excluded. Now in the incremental impact of the stock-based compensation, a revised $0.11 estimate for the incremental stock-based compensation in 2006, which is $0.02 less than the original $0.13 estimate, and also the $0.04 for the one-time charge of the elimination of the restoration grant. But it's the Stork Bill, it excludes all of the incremental impact of stock-based compensation and a $0.06 restructuring charge -- again, $0.03 in the third, $0.03 in the fourth.", "Several important factors are also influencing our expectations of earnings per share for the fourth quarter where we're estimating $0.53 to $0.55 per share. First and foremost, we still expect double-digit top and bottom line growth in financial services in the fourth quarter. ", "But there also will be the one-time $0.04 impact for transforming Sweets from a print catalog business to a subscription based businesses, obviously which will benefit 2007. That shift involves a change in revenue recognition, but the impact is somewhat larger than the $0.02 to $0.03 we originally estimated. ", "We also faced challenging comparisons. Again in The McGraw-Hill Education, fourth quarter revenue last year for McGraw-Hill School Education Group as we said earlier, grew by 23.6% and that was because of the $44 million in late orders from Texas. We had recognized the costs associated with that Texas order earlier in 2005, so the drop through was significant in the fourth quarter. We also expect the pressure on operating margins in our Educational Testing business to continue, as the whole nature of the business shifts from the high stakes to the low stakes or the summative to the formative testing business. And we will be making some investments in education that will have an impact on expenses as we prepare for a much bigger 2007. ", "So in short, we are taking some important actions to position us for a more rapid growth, starting 2007. But we are pleased with the performance in the third quarter and therefore, the ability to raise earnings guidance for the full year. ", "So, let me leave it with that and we can go in any direction you would like, but let me go to Bob Bahash now, our CFO and he has some further information for us on the financial side. ", "Robert Bahash", "Hey thank you, Terry. I will begin this morning with a discussion of cash flow, which was stronger than expected in the third quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we projected a return to a net surplus cash position by the end of this year. But with cash flow stronger than we thought, we are ahead of schedule and actually reached net surplus cash position in the third quarter. Our net cash position is $74.3 million, consisting of debt of $235 million, which is primarily in commercial paper borrowings in the U.S., offset by approximately $310 million in foreign cash holdings. Given our strong cash flow, we'll probably pay down all commercial paper borrowings by the end of the year.", "Net interest expense was $7.5 million in the third quarter, compared to about $3 million for the same period last year. The increase resulted from more commercial paper borrowings at higher interest rates to fund the stepped up share repurchases compared with the prior year. Strong cash flow has enabled the company to reduce commercial paper borrowings during the quarter. And we now expect the full year interest expense to range from $17 million to $19 million.", "Now for share repurchases. We did not purchase any shares during the third quarter. During the first half of the year, we did acquire 26.1 million shares at a cost of $1.4 billion. We expect to buyback 2.3 million shares during the fourth quarter to achieve our previously-announced 28.4 million share target for this year. When we complete this purchase, 20 million shares will remain from the 45 million share repurchase program approved by the Board in January 2006. This program represents in total 12.1% of the corporation's outstanding 372.7 million shares as of the end of 2005. Share repurchases will benefit earnings per share this year by approximately $0.03 and is reflected in the earnings guidance that Terry discussed earlier.", "With the buyback and dividend programs, we have returned increasing amounts of cash back to our shareholders. In 2004, we returned over $630 million. In 2005, we ramped that up to over $920 million. And so far in 2006, we have returned nearly $1.6 billion. Together, these represent a return of more than $3.1 billion to our shareholders. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2006 was 360.9 million shares, a 20.2 million share decrease compared to the third quarter of 2005 and a 4.6 million share decrease compared to the second quarter of this year.", "In the earnings release this morning, we reviewed the impact of restructuring a number of business operations in the third and fourth quarters. In the third quarter, the restructuring charge was $15.4 million or about $0.03 per share, primarily for employee severance in McGraw-Hill Education, information and media and at corporate. All told, we eliminated about 600 positions -- 400 at McGraw-Hill Education, 100 at information and media and 100 in our corporate business support areas. We will complete the restructuring this year in the fourth quarter. We anticipate an additional $0.03 restructuring charge in the fourth quarter for actions we contemplate but have not yet taken. The $16 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter relates primarily to vacating some facilities and eliminating another 100 positions in McGraw-Hill Education, information and media and at corporate.", "The fourth quarter action will bring our total restructuring charge for the year to $31.4 million or $0.06 per share primarily from the elimination of approximately 700 positions.", "Earlier this year, we reported we are transforming Sweets -- the McGraw-Hill construction group's popular building products database from a print catalogue to a fully integrated internet-based sales and marketing solution. This move has led to changes in our revenue recognition for the Sweets product sales. We estimated last year that the impact of the Sweets transformation would be $15 million or approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share. We now expect the impact to be in the range of $24 million or approximately $0.04. We are increasing our estimate because all of the Sweets' customers have contracted to purchase a bundled product, consisting of both print and online editions. This swift migration from standalone print to bundled contracts was not anticipated in our earlier estimate.", "Accounting standards require us to recognize revenue for subscription products over the contract period, rather than solely in the fourth quarter, which was how we recognized Sweets revenue in the past, but only if the standalone print product was delivered to customers in December. We will cycle through this change in 2007.", "There is another change I want to bring to your attention. When the company began expensing stock options at the beginning of this year, we had expected an incremental charge of $0.13 per share as a result of this accounting change. However, as a result of lower than expected incremental stock-based compensation activity, the company now expects the full year incremental charge to be $0.11 per share. In the third quarter, the company incurred incremental stock-based compensation expense of $14.6 million or $0.03 per share, which brings us to a year-to-date incremental expense of $54.1 million or $0.09 per share. ", "Now, let's take a look at our corporate expenses. In the third quarter, corporate expenses increased $11.9 million including 4.1 million of restructuring charges. The balance of the remaining increase is due primarily to increased compensation-related expenses. In 2006, we expect dilution of approximately $0.04 from the acquisitions made in 2004 and 2005. They will be approximately cash neutral. In 2007, we expect these acquisitions will be cash positive. The company did not make any material acquisitions or dispositions in the first nine months of 2006. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 37.2%, and we continue to project this rate for the balance of the year.", "Let's take a look at capital expenditures, which include prepublication investments and purchases of property and equipment. In the third quarter, our prepublication investments were $64 million compared to $67 million for the same period last year. For 2006, our current estimate for pre-pub investments is approximately $300 million. This level of investment is driven mainly for products we are currently developing to realize significant opportunities in the el-hi market in 2007, 2008, and 2009. However, through continued efficiencies, technology, and global sourcing, we anticiapte a reduction in spending from our earlier projection of $315 million.", "Purchases of property and equipment were about $25 million in the third quarter compared to $29 million for the same period last year. We are decreasing our projection of capital expenditures for 2006 from $200 million to $150 million. We are making this change because of the delay in the timing of expenditures associated with the construction of our new data center and other expenditures related to the implementation of digital technology initiatives until 2007. ", "Now for some non-cash items. In the third quarter, amortization of prepublication costs was $103 million compared to $99 million in the same period last year. We now expect $240 million for the full year, down slightly from our previous estimate of $250 million. Depreciation was $27 million in the third quarter compared to about $23 million in the same period last year. We continue to expect it to be about $130 million in 2006 reflecting the higher level of capital expenditures and a full year of depreciation of capital expenditures made in 2005. Amortization of intangibles was $12 million in the third quarter compared to $12.4 million in the same period last year, virtually flat. For 2006, we expect $50 million, up from $44.2 million in 2005. The increase is driven by 2005 acquisitions.", "Now, thanks and now back to Terry.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Okay. Thanks Bob, and as we came into 2006, we knew that we were facing from a market cycle standpoint, a weaker education market. And given that we are very pleased with the earnings performance across the board and the cost controls and the growth that we have been able to see, and we obviously are pleased to have the ability to raise our earnings guidance. And as we complete the year now, we start to focus on 2007 and beyond, we look forward to achieving that double-digit earnings growth and we fully expect to be able to do that.", "Let me turn it back to Don and then let's go in any direction anybody would like.", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for phone participants. (Operator Instructions). We will now get ready to take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. The first question comes from Frederick Searby with JP Morgan. You may ask your question.", "Frederick Searby - JP Morgan", "Yes. Thanks. Terry could you give us some color on credit derivatives in terms of the growth rates in the U.S. and Europe and what percent of revenues they were for the quarter? And then just secondly, any thoughts on coming into a strong adoption year next year, what's going to prevent -- what looks like somewhat of a share loss in Florida, even though you had a nice, I guess, in the secondary market, can you just talk about your positioning from a share competitive perspective in the education el-hi. Thank you?", "Harold McGraw, III", "Yeah. Thanks Fred. Yeah, in the structured finance market, obviously, it's been strong for the last several years and it's going to continue to be strong and then -- and the good part is that it continues to gain strength outside the United States. As we were saying in the -- in just some of the issuance numbers, the issuance for collateralized debt obligations, which is very large and a big area was up almost a 120% and it was up -- new issue dollar volume in Europe was up roughly 52%. So it's very, very strong. We continue to benefit obviously from the shift there. Now remember on the residential mortgage-backed securities market even though we are seeing year-over-year declines a little bit in the third and the fourth quarter, it is still very large. Overall, in 2006 in the residential mortgage-backed market, we sold $1.2 trillion of new issuance and that\u2019s in the U.S. alone. So it is very large and it continues to grow very strong, and the residential mortgage-backed market in Europe is also doing -- is growing very nicely and is doing really well. So with that overall the structured finance market is strong and it's going to continue to stay strong. We will see the year-over-year comparisons of residential start to decline a little bit, actually for the full year. I expect it to be flat to probably even positive, given where we see the pipeline. On the commercial mortgage-backed market, you're going to see the continued strong increases that we have been seeing since last year. On the asset-backed, a little bit softer on the asset-backed, but again, the CDO market and the collateralized loan obligation market are going to continue strong. Fred, on the K-12 side, in terms of the state adoption markets for next year, again, 2007, 2008, 2009 are going to be really very, very good markets for the K-12 publishing business. Some of the major adoptions for next year, you're going to see California K-12 Science. You've got Florida with Health, K-12 Health, World Languages, Applied subjects. You've got Georgia with K-12 Math, Texas 6 to 12 Math, and then we start getting into major reading adoption, especially the Florida K-12 reading adoption in 2008.  So the pipeline there is going to be strong, and it's going to be in the major disciplines.  And we're pleased where we are this point, especially because on the reading side, Treasures, which we have launched this year, and really focused on the open territories is doing so well.", "Frederick Searby - JP Morgan", "Great, thanks a lot guys.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Thanks Fred.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Goldman Sachs; you may ask your question.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks you, good morning. Terry, or Bob, is it possible to quantify the cost savings you expect to achieve from the headcount reductions you've implemented, particularly, I am thinking about the education segment. And then related to that, I'm wondering if these cost reductions caused you to rethink the timing of your 20% margin target within the education unit, and maybe even,  it implies there could be some upsides of that target.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Okay, thanks Peter. Yeah, there is cost saving associated with all of the restructuring and some of the combination initiatives that we\u2019ve taken, like the global transformation project, like the global resource management project and so forth. For the most part, the restructuring was associated with the combination of the elementary and secondary school operations. We\u2019re very excited about that. This is something that is very new in the industry, and it gives us a lot of continuity and product development, and it gives us a higher level of focus in some of the sales and marketing areas. So, we\u2019re pleased with that. But, again when we start talking about the margin improvement that we expect to see in 2007, '08 and '09, as we approach 2010, the GTP, the Global Resource Management, these restructurings are all about getting to a higher margin level. And so, from a target standpoint, I think we would leave it as where it is right now at 20%, but obviously we're going to be working very aggressively to be able to achieve that. ", "After that as we become more online focused and as the market accepts more online participation, obviously, you are cutting 25% of your cost structure in terms of paper binding and printing and all of those kind of things. So, we'll see beyond 2010. We will work hard to get to the margin goal that we've got there.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Right, but no specific estimates in terms of the dollar magnitude of the costs you are taking out in the context to these specific cuts?", "Harold McGraw, III", "No, and not at this point. We will be able to do that as we go forward, but obviously we are looking at a very good 2007 and the double-digit earnings guidance and we've taken the opportunity to make sure that we are in a good position to do that. So, the cost savings are obviously a factor in doing that and why we took the actions that we've taken.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "All right, okay. Just one follow-up, I think Bob mentioned or you mentioned, Terry, that you would cut marketing and sampling costs in the Education segment this year. Is there any risk associated with cutting the marketing expense in terms of implications for your share performance next year?", "Harold McGraw, III", "No, I mean, it really has to do with the fact that there is -- the schedule is so light for 2006 that we were able to obviously save on the variable costs associated with the lower schedule. So, as we see the demand pick up coming into next year, those variable expenses obviously come back in all of that, but with a higher revenue the better return, on that one. But, again we were just being able to take advantage of really good cost savings. I would also add one other thing, Peter. It's also the efficiencies here, in terms of how we look at the whole production and design process and how we have been be able to save cost there by doing some outsourcing and doing some pickup on that side, and we will continue to look at that. That\u2019s coming out of not only global transformation, but also the global resource management capability.", "Robert Bahash", "Peter, in addition to Terry's comments here, when he talked about the fourth quarter, we are seeing a step up clearly in some of our sales and marketing promotion costs because of the big opportunities in 2007. So, that\u2019s another factor entering into what our forecast is looking at the fourth quarter to really help to ensure the sales objectives that we have for 2007.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Thank you.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Thanks Peter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Shipman with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Brian Shipman - UBS", "Thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions. First Bob, could you tell us what the Financial Services division operating profit growth was, excluding CVC? Second, Terry, I was wondering if you could give us a better idea as to your expectations for revenue growth from the Schools Education Group in the fourth quarter? Is it going to be worse -- given the comparisons, is it going to be worse than what we saw in the third quarter or better or comparable? And then I may have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Robert Bahash", "Okay. Just getting that specific information excluding CVC, I will have it for you in just a moment.", "Brian Shipman - UBS", "Okay. ", "Harold McGraw, III", "On that revenue growth in the fourth quarter, remember in the fourth quarter for education it's much more of a higher education market. The only reason that we had such strong growth in the fourth quarter of 2005 was because of the timing associated with the Texas spending on that one. Usually you don\u2019t see that kind of K-12 spent in the fourth quarter. So for the Higher Education Group, which is doing quite well, my sense is that you are going to see better revenue growth because of that but it's going to be less on the K-12 side.", "Brian Shipman - UBS", "Okay. ", "Robert Bahash", "With regard to third quarter revenue growth, revenue growth excluding CVC from previous year was almost 18%, 17.9%", "Brian Shipman - UBS", "Right, and the operating profit, I'm sorry that\u2019s actually what I was after.", "Robert Bahash", "Okay, operating profit was in excess of 20%.", "Brian Shipman - UBS", "Okay. And then, Terry, one other follow-up, if you will, please. If I recall, you ran into trouble a few years ago in Florida again, I believe, on the math side. Can you talk more about McGraw's positioning in Florida please? Is there some kind of legacy issue going on there that\u2019s affecting your performance?", "Harold McGraw, III", "No, I mean, again the middle school and the secondary school, which are under the Glencoe imprint have -- are clearly number one. I mean they are so strong in all of that and our problem has been on the elementary side. Now one of the -- and here again, remember now we are talking programs and bigger programs, the issue this year and with the elementary science program had to do with the state-specific guidelines. They wanted a very detailed state-specific program. Now what you've got to look at very carefully here is the cost benefit of developing a program that would be so state-specific that it might not get you any kind of return. We made a conscious decision coming out of North Carolina with this science program that did so well -- we made a conscious decision to make it state-specific to Florida, but only to a point on that one. And in hindsight that was a decision that did not bode well for us on it. But we did overall, on Science, for example in Florida we did very well but that was because we had such huge performances in the middle school and the secondary school on that side.", "Brian Shipman - UBS", "Okay thanks Terry.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Thank you Brian.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Monaco with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, yes, on the amortization of pre-pub costs you could give us a number for '07and then I have a follow-up.", "Robert Bahash", "Yeah actually it's bit early because we are not even into the budgeting process for 2007, but clearly it's going to be a higher number because we have increased our spending. So, it's hard to predict at this point of time what it's going to be, Lisa, but there is no question it's going to be a higher number because of the additional ramp up in spending with regard to the significant programs that will be released, but we will have that for you probably by the next call, clearly.", "Harold McGraw, III", "And just to add on to that Lisa again, you know, remember with these larger programs especially in reading and math, these are -- it takes 2, 2.5 years to develop these programs, so we are really finishing up now on the costs for 2007, and we are really working on 2008-2009 product on that one. So you will see that continue to ramp up a little.", "Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "And is there any way to give us some color -- not to harp on this, but in terms of the margins for next year, any general yield for el-hi, what percentage of the current costs that you would recognize in that given year are for the programs, which you will realize revenue for that given year and what -- and generally what percentage is for forward years?", "Robert Bahash", "In a major release year for any given program, you are going to have a higher cost element relating to that release, combination of sampling costs, free with order costs depending upon the type of program and of course your amortization costs. In the K-12 space we amortize our cost generally over five years, some of the digits. So a major piece of your amortization goes out in that very first year. So there is a frontloading of costs in one sense -- of course frontloading and revenue as well, but it does have a margin impact. You have very significant benefits as you go out into the future years -- you are getting nice benefits in that year, but very nice benefits as you go out because your cost structure is lower, you have residual revenue coming in without sampling free with order costs as well.", "Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just two unrelated questions. Is there any way for you to give us a little bit more color on what the revenue growth performance for JD Power was and what I guess the profit growth was? And secondly if you could just elaborate again on what's driving the strength in the bank loan issuance, and I think you mentioned that the strength continued into 4Q, what's holding that up? Thanks?", "Harold McGraw, III", "Well, Lisa, the acquisitions that we completed in 2005 are all doing really well. We talked about Capital IQ, we've talked about -- well we actually didn\u2019t talk about CRISIL in India. They're doing exceptionally well on that one, but the JD Power, we don\u2019t give out specific unit information on that one. But those acquisitions and JD Power are exceeding the base plan that we had for them. They're doing really well, and they\u2019re doing well because -- JD Power now is doing well because of what we were talking about with the non-automotive side. The automotive side is doing exceptionally well and you'd expect that. But the non-automotive areas especially in financial services including insurance and brokerage, is doing very well, and we expect that to continue. The global part is also quite exciting. As we\u2019ve said, all the roads go online, all roads go to Asia, and the Asia-Pacific region increasingly becomes a more and more important for us, and two-thirds of their non-U.S. growth is coming out of that region. And we expect that to continue as well. And then the bank loan market, again, bank loan market is again a big piece of our non-traditional net ratings activities, activities not tied to the new issuance market and it is now up getting close to 24% of total ratings revenue, and we expect that to continue.", "Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Meltz with Bear Stearns. You may ask your question.", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "Great. Thank you. Two quick questions on Information and Media. Bob, I saw on one of the slides, you've got a benefit in the quarter, and can you just talk a little bit about that and quantify that? And then secondly, the Sweets -- just so I understand the Sweets migration, I understand the concept, I just thought it would have been impacting you all year already. And now it sounds like you are saying it is more an '07 event. Can you just talk a little bit about that and then I have a follow-up?", "Robert Bahash", "Okay. Let me deal with the Sweets item first. The product previously that we used to produce was a book that came out once a year, a collection of marketing promotion pieces for a number of major building suppliers. This product would be sold during the course of the year. The advertising and promotional types of material and such would be bound and put together during the fourth quarter and the product would be shipped in December. So, it was a fourth quarter event, revenue recognition event. That\u2019s how it always had been historically. No difference in previous years. As we went into this year when we gave you guidance earlier clearly with the web many of these suppliers have their own website, so they would question -- is a single bound book really the right way to spend some of their marketing dollars as -- well right now they have a very robust website. What we have tried to communicate to these individuals is that there is a tremendous opportunity, not only part of the sweets.com offering here, but also to be part of the construction network. With their web-based product offerings as we have a package not only would they be reaching their particular customers that they want to reach, the builders, the architects, but those individuals would then be able to put -- input that data into their specifications as they are bidding on particular sites. So, there is a greater connection to not only accessing the information, but also specifying that information with a particular building project. So, when we entered into the year, we thought there would be a different mixture of individuals purchasing either just the electronic product, individuals purchasing the print product or a bundled product. What we've found and we are very pleased to see this is that virtually every customer wanted the electronic product in addition to the print product. So as a result it is just simply -- is a revenue recognition issue. The customer penetration that we had thought we were going reach in the beginning of the year is about exactly where we are, It's just that the mix of revenue is going to be much more recognized over a 12-month period than a split between some being recognized in the fourth quarter of this year and the balance being recognized more broadly. So that is why we have increased the estimate from $15 million to $24 million. On the other item, it is just simply a business item that was in dispute and we reversed the reserve. And I don\u2019t really want to get into the specifics of it, but it was a large enough in terms of an impact on the quarter that we wanted to point it out to you. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "How big was that?", "Robert Bahash", "The net impact of that was $8 million.", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "Is that solely at the EBIT line or is that in revenues as well?", "Robert Bahash", "Both, revenue and EBIT line.", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Two quick ones. At S&P on the index side, do you expect any benefit from the Chicago Exchange mergers and then I have one follow-up there.", "Harold McGraw, III", "No, I think it's very exciting. I think we are going to see a lot of activity in terms of exchanges and the coordination of exchanges doing more together. And I think that it makes for bigger markets and it gives us more opportunity to work with them. We have a terrific relationship with both and I see no -- I see nothing that would create an impediment for us, I look at it just the other way. It\u2019s a way to extend those relationships. But we are going to see that again throughout Europe and Asia as well, as you see more cooperation between exchanges and combinations that way. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "And last question, do you expect any impact near term on your education business from this Reading First situation?", "Harold McGraw, III", "No, and again I'm not sure what you know about it or whatever, but some of the comments that we were steering Reading First dollars by having access to expert panels and all, that is all nonsense. The fact of the matter is, is that we've got an extremely successful program and that\u2019s the Open Court phonics-based reading program coming out of The McGraw-Hill Learning Group, which is our No Child Left Behind group and if some people have competitive problems with that, so be it. But just because you have an extremely successful program, I get a little exercised on that one. We'll compete in the market on merit and we'll stay with that. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "Okay thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Dobell with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", "Hi. Terry, maybe you could just give us a little color on the S&P business in the U.S. versus internationally. Any major or significant differences in margins between the two geographies? And I guess in particular in terms of pricing on similar types of deals, so structure or CDO in Europe or Asia for example versus the US, any differences there? And then Bob, also on S&P, you also mentioned little bit of timing of expenses of that being an issue here in Q3, I wondered if we could get an  the order of magnitude on what that might have been? And then I have one follow-up. Thanks. ", "Harold McGraw, III", "Yes, Brandon on the structured finance market here and in Europe, again the trend is what's important. As the structured market is the securitized world, gains increasing acceptance, most institutional investors are looking for that kind of product, financial institutions like it a lot, obviously because they are offloading that risk. And so, you are going to see that trend just absolutely continue, and you are going to see more growth outside the United States as that ramps-up. It's a more sophisticated market in one sense here in the United States because we have been at it longer and that trend is going to continue as we get to Europe. But also in the Japan and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, even in Latin America, even Mexico, we are seeing some nice representation there, especially in the housing market.  But it really hasn\u2019t quite, when you start talking about margins, the revenue growth is going to be very strong on the non U.S. side. When you start talking about margins, it's really a question of size and scale. As you start to build up that size and scale, the margins are going to obviously increase on that one. So, in parts of Europe you have got very competitive margins, very competitive pricing to the United States. As you go in to certain other markets, newer markets, it's a ramp-up on that one. But eventually there will be no difference in terms of the pricing and the margin expectation that way. It's really a size and scale as you ramp up. ", "Robert Bahash", "Brandon, can you elaborate on your question about the expense timing, what area were you talking about?", "Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", "I think it's within S&P, it sounded like that was some of the driver for the year-over-year margin change, want to get a sense of if it was material or then if we should expect those expenses to show up in Q4, or if it was pushed from Q2 into Q3, just trying to get a better sense of kind of what you guys meant there?", "Robert Bahash", "Okay, there is nothing significant there. The only thing I can tell you is that just like the other segments, the S&P the Financial Services segment, is looking at efficiencies, looking at offshoring, outsourcing for a number of different initiatives. They are focusing on more of the captive approach to offshoring versus the other segments using third parties because of the relationships that they currently have with Capital IQ as well as CRISIL. Capital IQ leveraging some of the data information, the data type collection opportunities, they are creating initiatives for them; CRISIL, more from a standpoint of the analytic support. So, there are activities going on there, some timing of expenses in terms of where those things may be ramping up, but nothing of any significance here, Brandon.", "Harold McGraw, III", "And I would just add, Brandon, that when you exclude the $33 million from CVC, which we divested last year, revenue growth was up 17.9% and that\u2019s what's driving us.", "Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", "Then one final one, with the stock now at kind of a year/all-time high, maybe your perspective or philosophy on continued share repurchases, is that the best use for capital, given what the stock continues to do -- I just want to get your thoughts on how you think about the value of buying stocks or when it make the most sense?", "Harold McGraw, III", "Yeah, well, you know, again, that\u2019s an ongoing judgment call and how does one use your free cash flow and between dividends and share repurchases, acquisitions, organic growth. We will continue to be looking hard at tuck-in acquisitions that will support either a platform that exists or creates a platform and component acquisitions that strengthen a platform, and we will continue on that. The problem I have, Brandon, is that with a lot of the excess liquidity still in the market, you know, you see some people that are looking for really high returns and taking enormous risks to get them, I don\u2019t think this is a great environment to be paying four or five times revenues, you know, for some of these acquisitions. So, I think we will see an improved environment as we get into the latter part of 2007 and 2008, and I'm just not going to seek some of those very, very high valuations, that doesn\u2019t make sense, we will never get a return on that one. So, we focus a lot in this kind of environment on organic growth, and again, given the strength of the markets that we have and the expectations we have for '07 and beyond, we are focusing really hard on being able to satisfy those kinds of needs. And we will continue to make that -- analyze all of those kind of things, but we think the stock repurchase program and the return that we've given back to the shareholder, we think that\u2019s been a very, very good program for us and we like it.", "Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Karl Choi with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning, a couple of questions here. The first one is I wonder if you can talk about whether -- going back to Florida for a second, whether you are seeing an increase in demand for customization from different states, and if so, whether that would have an impact on how you compete in margin overall and I have a follow-up question.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Okay. In terms of mass customization, help me with that, Karl --", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "In terms of customization of specific programs, are you seeing an increase in demand and as a result does that have an impact on your margins overall over a longer period of time?", "Harold McGraw, III", "No, I think -- really the part that impacted revenues from the elementary side was the lack of revenue on that one. The mass customization -- really, I would put it a little bit differently to you. You are going to see more bundling of capabilities because as people are really focused on performance, student achievement and school performance, and you are benchmarking them, you are going to have to provide more capabilities to be able to ensure that they are getting that kind of performance. Therefore you're going to see much more push in the online market, you are going to see more push in remedial, more push in intervention products for people that are falling behind. So, one of the things that we are excited about with the reorganization of our elementary and secondary market school operations, is the continuity. We think that in terms of being able to put together a more continuous product that takes into account a building process, especially in reading, especially in math is going to very important. Testing in Science takes place in 2007 and we are going to see more activity on that side as well but I think it's going to be important to have a continuous product there.", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "And second question is, you previously have stated that you expect operating income for your education division to fall by as much as 10% in fiscal '06, just wonder whether you have any update on that outlook either with or without restructuring costs?", "Robert Bahash", "Yeah, we had indicated that we would have a decline in our profits in that range; we are still forecasting to be in that general zone.", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "And that is before or after the restructuring charges?", "Robert Bahash", "That\u2019s before.", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "And actually last question is to clarify the fourth quarter guidance of $0.53 to $0.54 that is before the restructuring charges as well, right?", "Robert Bahash", "That\u2019s correct. It\u2019s before -- the $0.53 to $0.55 is similar to the forecast that Terry had given, $2.53 to $2.55 before the incremental stock-based compensation, both the $0.11 -- the revised $0.11 and the $0.04 reload as well as the restructuring charge that occurred in the third and fourth quarters.", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.", "Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning everyone. Terry, my first question for you pertains to the mid-term elections that are coming. Any potential concerns at the state or Federal level, any changes to education policy as a result of that? And then secondly, maybe for Bob, it looks like you are recognizing some efficiencies as well as some timing issues in terms of your investment pre-pub and CapEx. How should we think about those in 2007 relative to your original guidance? Thanks.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Drew, on the mid-term elections -- boy, I'd better stay out of that one in terms of forecasting it, but as it relates to No Child Left Behind, no -- no, I mean No Child Left Behind is bipartisan. One can always have issues as to we ought to have funded more, we ought to have put more weight on this versus that and whatever. The important thing is the Education Reform Movement in America is so strong and it is clearly underway. It has taken time for the No Child Left Behind to get into the states and get administered that way and it has taken time for the Department of Education as well on that one. But -- and but that would be expected with something as major as that. But you've got aligment now between Federal, state and local that you've never had before. The focus is all on performances against student acheivement and school performance, and therefore I see no retreat from that. In fact, we are going to be working with DOE for obviously reauthorizaton of No Child Left Behind for next year, and we are going to see more emphasis now on the secondary. I mean a lot of the early emphasis has been on the early childhood learning. Obviously, the urban markets and that push for reading in particular and then you saw it with the early reading and reading first areas. We are going to see the push in not only reading, but math and science in particular as we get into the middle and the secondary school, and you are going to see more emphasis placed on that -- teacher training and development as well. We are also going to start to see a lot more discussion about higher education and you are going to see something in the reauthorization bill on that as well on that one. But I see no reversal on education side of the momentum in terms of billing under reform movement.", "Robert Bahash", "With regard to your question about pre-pub and CapEx, let me take pre-pub first. Clearly we are experiencing benefits from the efficiencies not only of the offshoring side, but we expect to generate efficiencies from the combination of McMillan and Glencoe, and let me talk about each one. We are using all the most current technologies in the development of products where it\u2019s not necessarily a linear handoff, but a number of editorial individuals can be working on projects collectively together which is very, very helpful. Using off-shoring vendors to help us in the page layout, the digitization is helping us tremendously; and as we are going through we weren\u2019t exactly certain how quickly and how deeply we would be penetrating this work effort with these individuals and that\u2019s why quite frankly we have been coming down a little bit each quarter with regard to how much we were expecting to spend. So no question we are getting efficiencies and that will help us as we go out into the future. As I indicated earlier it is little bit -- it is really too soon to be forecasting what our pre-pub investments are for next year. All I can say to you that was -- they are clearly going to be lower than where we had originally thought they were going to be simply because of the efficiencies that have been proven and will continue to generate these operating efficiencies. I think also with regard to the Centers of Excellence being creative with School Solutions we will see clear efficiencies there in that development process.", "On the CapEx side that's more simply a timing thing. Next year should be a higher year, again, not know exactly how that will fall, but the development of the new data center to support the digital nature of our company is significant. That's underway. We are just, I think, probably being a little bit too aggressive in terms of how we were thinking we are going to proceed with that development in terms of the timing of expenditures. We -- the completion of the program in early 2008 is still on target, but the expenditure side is a little bit slower. So you will see bigger spending on that initiative in 2007. Little bit too early to call how much that is but it will be up there in that range probably in the 200 range.", "Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Robert Bahash", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from William Bird with Citigroup. You may ask your question.", "William Bird - Citigroup", "Yeah. Just a follow on related to pre-publication investment, it seems that your level of pre-pub investment has been lower than your competitor Pearson and the gap also seems to be widening. You mentioned offshoring as one explanation and some of the efficiencies you are gathering. Maybe you could talk a little bit about maybe some other things that might explain differences and what you would expect going forward? Thank you.", "Robert Bahash", "We're using a number of very significant and very, very -- well, quite frankly, excellent workflow tools. We have been implementing a number of new technology initiatives in that process, and it has helped us tremendously. I really can't comment where our competitors are in the use of electronic workflow tools, or where they maybe on the offshoring side, but I can only talk from our standpoint that the editorial teams have done a great deal of work in this effort.  This is not simply -- first of all we have been outsourcing this type of work for many, many years. So, the thought of outsourcing to a different location was not foreign to our individuals. We've had a number of individuals of the development side traveling to India, meeting with our vendors offshore, not just the vendors, but meeting with their colleagues that they\u2019re going to be working with on a day-to-day basis. They are traveling here as well. We've gotten a high level of comfort and we have pushed more and more work in that direction. ", "Again, I can't really comment where our competitors might be, but we see this as a very significant competitive advantage to permit us to do more of the customization work, a question that was raised earlier, where we can do a heck of a lot more on the customization side in the development of these programs, so we can be much, much -- hopefully create a competitive advantage for us versus several of our competitors.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Yeah, and I'd only add to that Bill, that, a lot of this began early on with the global transformation project, but the whole global resource management capability; its not just an education, this is straight across the board, in terms of process improvement and efficiencies on that. We have launched a significant Six Sigma capability and that process has benefited us and I expect that to continue.", "William Bird - Citigroup", "Just as a follow-on, Terry, you touched on uses of cash a little bit earlier. Was just wondering if you could just speak a little bit to your cash build and in the context of acquisitions and what kind of acquisition strategy you would expect to be following?", "Harold McGraw, III", "Well, again as Bob indicated, we will be in a very good cash position by the end of the year and once again we will be thinking through the allocation of that. As far as acquisitions go -- again, we have to take a look at what valuations are. We have a very full pipeline and all of that. They are focused on the core growth areas. When he is talking about especially outside the United States, the continued development of the growth of the capital markets and the specifics within, we are looking very aggressively at building on those kinds of relationships. CRISIL was a good example and the follow-on acquisitions that CRISIL has been able to make, bring more transparency to that developing market. You are going to see more in the Asia-Pacific region. We are spending a lot of time there. You are seeing tremendous growth in the ASEAN base. We've got initiatives in Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and obviously China on that one. So, you are going to see continued push on that part. ", "On the education side, we are developing obviously very strong online development programs and we want to continue to focus on that, and anything that brings transparency via content to a particular market. We are looking at all of those.", "William Bird - Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now take our final question from Steven Barlow with Prudential Equity Group. You may ask your question.", "Steven Barlow - Prudential Equity Group", "Thank you, two quick ones here. On the education side, you didn\u2019t have some success on a couple of the states with a couple of the books. Does that mean that you have to go back to the drawing board, retool those books to get yourself in better position for the next couple of years of adoptions or is it just really a sales issue in that particular state and then you basically have fixed sales process in that state? Secondly, can you just talk a little bit about Capital IQ again? What is the number of people you have there versus when you started and an update really on the dilution or non-dilution of that for full year 2006?", "Harold McGraw, III", "Okay. Steve first on the education side, no, it's not a product problem. The decision that we made in Florida on elementary science really was one to go with the national edition with some state specific and we didn\u2019t go to a detailed level. Again, when you take a look at overall, we are right up at the top when you talk about the entire science or social studies in California for that matter. Again, in the Florida secondary market, we took a 39% share, 4% in the elementary and 39% in the secondary. So, it clearly -- it sounds it wasn't flawed product, I think it was the approach that we took towards state specific. Same thing in social studies; in California, it did very well. So, it's not -- from that stand point, it's not a product issue, and so there is no redesign that way. But what we will do with the new combination is we will be selling a more -- with more continuity a K-12 product that will build through the elementary into the middle school and into the secondary school market and I look forward to that. You'll see some design and implications associated with that as we go forward.", "On Capital IQ, Capital IQ remember now is a platform acquisition, and we have now catenated on to that platform Compustat and some other data components, and we will continue to build data components onto that platform. So when you take a look at the employment base there, it is obviously increased a lot but that\u2019s also because of the growth of it. Capital IQ in terms of an acquisition, just looking apples-to-apples at its existing operation is way ahead of the acquisition plan that we had put together and is doing exceptionally well as the product is so well accepted in the market on that part. And we expect that to continue and you can expect that we are going to be very aggressive in developing additional data components for it.", "Robert Bahash", "You asked about the headcount at Capital IQ, and Capital IQ I think specifically probably where you were going was with regard to our India headcount and that is right now approaching 1900 employees and this is growing, one because of Capital IQ and the roughly 40% growth in client penetration, but more importantly the leveraging across the S&P franchise to move more and more work into that particular business. So, as Terry points out not only is Capital IQ meeting and exceeding the particular targets that we have but across the board we are leveraging the capabilities of Capital IQ to help to reduce costs and hopefully grow revenues in other parts of the enterprise. So there is multiple benefits to the enterprise as a result of the Capital IQ acquisition.", "Steven Barlow - Prudential Equity Group", "Thank you.", "Harold McGraw, III", "Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call.

(Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to Donald Rubin, SVP of Investor Relations for the McGraw-Hill Companies. Sir, you may begin. ", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you and good morning and thank everyone from around the world for joining us today at the McGraw-Hill Companies fourth quarter 2006 earnings conference call. I\u2019m Donald Rubin, SVP for Investor Relations at the McGraw-Hill Companies. With me today are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO and Robert Bahash, EVP and CFO of the corporation. ", "This morning the corporation issued a news release with fourth quarter 2006 results. We trust you\u2019ve had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of it and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.McGraw-Hill.com/investor_relations. ", "Before we begin this morning, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates, and descriptions of future events.

", "We\u2019re aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call however, this call is for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Mr. Steve Weiss in our New York office at 212-512-2247 subsequent to this call. ", "Today\u2019s update will last approximately an hour. After the presentation the meeting will be open to questions and answers. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President, and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw. ", "Harold McGraw", "Thank you, Don. Good morning and welcome. Thank you, everyone for being with us today to go through the review of the McGraw-Hill Companies\u2019 fourth quarter and year end results. As Don said, joining me for today\u2019s conference call is Bob Bahash, he\u2019s our EVP and CFO of the companies. ", "We will start today by reviewing the performance of our business and the outlook for 2007. Bob will then review our financial performance and he\u2019ll discuss some of our expectations for 2007 as well. When our presentation has concluded, obviously we\u2019ll go in any direction any of you would like about the companies. ", "Earlier this morning, we announced full year and fourth quarter results for 2006. We reported that earnings per share increased 8.6% to $2.40 for 2006 and by 12% to $0.56 for the fourth quarter. Revenue grew by 4.2% for the year to $6.3 billion and 3.4% to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. The results include a number of charges largely due to the expenses for stock-based compensation, which are all carefully enumerated in the earnings release and the schedule that accompanies it. But I\u2019ve also asked Bob Bahash to comment on them later in the call so that everybody has those exactly in perspective. ", "The bottom line is that we clearly have had a successful year, and we were also able to exceed our guidance for both 2006 and the fourth quarter and we\u2019re pleased about that. With continued strength in financial services and a rebounding education market, we\u2019re poised for double-digit earnings growth in 2007. All segments will contribute to this performance with improving operating margins. We are using $2.50 as the base for our double-digit earnings guidance for 2007. We arrived at this figure by adding back to GAAP earnings of $2.40 the non-recurring charges in 2006 of $0.04 for the elimination of the restoration stock option program and the $0.06 for restructuring; so $2.50, the base for the double-digit guidance for 2007. ", "Management is dedicated to creating total shareholder value. We\u2019re very proud of the fact that our total return has outperformed the S&P 500 for each of the last ten, seven, three and one-year periods. As part of our commitment to advancing total shareholder value, we\u2019ve been steadily returning more cash to shareholders, and that\u2019s of course through stock buybacks and increased dividends. At the end of January, the board of directors at the regular monthly meeting on January 31st will review the dividend and the buyback programs. We bought back 28.4 million shares in 2006, cash dividends have increased at 10.3% compound annual growth rate since 1974. Obviously, we\u2019ll have more to say about the dividend and the future buybacks in a few days. ", "As we look ahead, our economists believe slower economic growth should permit the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates around mid-year. The Fed has maintained the Fed funds rate at 5.25%, but could ease to around 4.5% by the end of 2007. Corporate cash flow is expected to remain strong, so will capital spending. State finances are in good shape, and of course that\u2019s a plus for the education market. ", "With this background in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the operations and why we\u2019re optimistic about our growth prospects for 2007. Let me begin with McGraw-Hill Education. The bookings for education in 2006 were growth in the higher education, professional and international markets which produced 47% of the segment\u2019s revenue in 2006; and a decline in the school education group, which is largely attributable to a weaker elementary/high school market and tough comparisons after a very successful 2005 performance. ", "Revenue for the segment declined in 2006 by 5.5%. Operating profit declined 19.8% and that includes incremental expenses of $19.6 million for stock-based compensation and a charge for the elimination of the restoration stock option program. ", "On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin was 13.8% and that excludes the charge for the elimination of the restoration stock option program and restructuring charges of $16 million in the second half. Excluding taking those out and putting them back in, it would be 13%. ", "As part of the restructuring, we vacated some facilities and eliminated 450 positions. In a weaker year for state new adoptions, we reduced the segment\u2019s costs and expenses by nearly 3%. Softer market conditions and challenging comparisons were most pronounced in the fourth quarter. The school education group\u2019s revenue fell 30.2% in the fourth quarter and 12.4% for the year. In 2005 we received $44 million in late new adoption orders from Texas, which helped boost our fourth quarter revenue by 23.6% and so the comparison makes it difficult. In 2006 there was no major order from Texas and there was additional weakness in the testing business. ", "Our performance in the important state new adoptions in 2006 produced some outstanding successes and some disappointments. A 5% share for the Florida elementary science adoption, but a 39% share of the larger secondary market; a 15% share of the elementary social studies adoption in California, but a 32% share of the middle school and a 40% share of the high school market. These exceptional capture rates in the middle and the high school markets and our year-over-year increase in territory sales couldn\u2019t offset the tough comparisons from 2005 and a 30% decline in the state new adoption opportunities in 2006. ", "We had expected the el-high market in 2006 to finish flat to down 4%. In fact, the market declined by 5.8% and even the industry\u2019s open sales were off 0.3%, essentially flat in 2006, and of course this is all according to the AAP figures. Our school education group outperformed the competition in open territories, benefiting from a very strong showing from Treasures. That\u2019s our new elementary reading basal. Although our secondary science and social studies programs were very successful, we underperformed in the state new adoption market. ", "In testing, we saw a continued decline in the sales of norm-referenced shelf tests which are being displaced by the state-specific standards-based assessments required under the Federal No Child Left Behind legislation. In the fourth quarter, volume from custom contracts declines as states reduced the scope of work on several of our continuing contracts. We\u2019ve also discontinued some low-margin custom contracts, service revenue for state assessment contracts declined from $246.1 million in 2005 to $214.4 million in 2006. ", "The good news is that starting in 2007 the performance of our school education group will definitely improve. There are several reasons for this optimism. One is that we start with a growing market. The state new adoption market enters the first of three consecutive growth years and could increase by as much as 15% in 2007. We now expect open territory sales to grow in the low to mid single-digit range. That combination should lead the market growth to about 4% to 6% this year. We expect to outperform that. Clearly, year-over-year comparisons will be easier for our school education group in 2007. ", "We also expect to do better because the school education group will be participating in more of the addressable market in 2007 than it did in 2006. In most years, we participated in virtually the entire state new adoption market; but in 2006, for strategic reasons, we competed for about 80% of the available dollars in this state new adoption market. We captured about 25% of the market in which we competed, but only 20% of the total available state new adoption market, well below our usual capture rate which normally runs about 30%. ", "In 2007, we have timed the introduction and enhancements of new products to pursue bigger growth opportunities in a more robust market. In science, we have new elementary and secondary programs which have been customized for major adoption state. Real math, a skills-oriented elementary program, won a number of small and medium-size adoptions last year and is well-positioned for more growth in 2007 in both open territories and adoption states where it has been submitted. ", "Student tests were positive in schools that piloted the program last year and that will add to the momentum for this research-based program in 2007. Every Day mathematics, the best-selling program in the reform-oriented segment of the K-6 market, is continuing to win new business. We will extend the brand into the secondary grades with a new program in 2007. Reading with purpose for middle schools and the Readers Choice for high schools are a new series for the important secondary reading and literature market. We had some early success with these programs last year in the open territory and expect them to be very competitive in the state new adoption market in 2007. ", "Treasures, the new basal reading program for the elementary schools will build on the good start that it made in open territory last year. We are enhancing and expanding our line-up of products in reading and math for the fast-growing intervention market. For example, we\u2019re adding middle school components to our successful Numbers World and Kaleidoscope programs; Jamestown Reading Navigator, a subscription-based reading program for grades 6 through 12 was piloted with more than 100,000 students in 2006. The new program had early adoptions last year in Massachusetts, Texas and Florida and recently won state level approval for purchase in 2007 by districts in California, Tennessee, and West Virginia. ", "We also entered 2007 with a stronger organization to compete in the core basal market. As you may recall, we combined our elementary and secondary basal publishing groups last year. That reorganization is now 100% complete. We believe that streamlining improves the sharing of resources -- very important -- the delivery of competitive pre-K through 12 solutions, our cost efficiencies from product development through sales and marketing, the growth of our top line and our return on sales. ", "We compete with a spectrum of products in the reading and math markets. This depth and breadth strategy encompasses the balanced basal segment in the middle and the progressive and skills-based market. That gives us an extraordinary range of options for meeting the needs of students and teachers in a very diverse marketplace. ", "We expect some improvement in the testing market as technology investments help us increase our efficiency. We will also be making new investments to improve our penetration of the rapidly growing formative testing market. This is the so-called low stakes market because educators use formative assessments during the school year, essentially to gauge how well students are prepared to take the summative or the high stakes tests at the end of the academic year. ", "With the No Child Left Behind Act\u2019s emphasis on accountability for student performance, the market is looking for better ways to monitor and diagnose classroom progress. Teachers are realizing that there are issues with many of the homegrown assessment programs that they\u2019ve been using. Most are not online, and the turnaround time is slow. Our new formative program is online and customized to meet state standards. It provides predictive and diagnostic tests to meet the market\u2019s evolving demand for measurement-based formative assessment and we\u2019re very encouraged by the initial response to the program. ", "We\u2019re also expecting more improvement in 2007 from our higher education professional and international group. In 2006, our higher education and professional products grew both here and abroad. We had a strong finish in the international and professional markets. Our performance in the U.S. college market softened in the fourth quarter with only the business and economics imprints showing a gain for the period. ", "The best performance for the year was turned in by our science, engineering and math imprint which had solid growth. For 2006 it now looks like the U.S. college and university market grew about 3%, somewhat better than our performance. We expect the market to grow about 4% in 2007 and think our strong list of new products will give us an opportunity to do better. Higher education is expected to grow faster in international markets. ", "Our growing array of digital products and services contributed to growth in 2006 and will do so again in 2007. In the college and university market, we are getting some traction with Homework Manager and similar digital products in accounting, math and world languages. We\u2019ve also introduced 40 new online courses for the college market and that should have a positive impact in 2007. ", "These online courses, incidentally, are finalists in two categories: one category the best education solution and the other category the best post-secondary course and content management solution for the prestigious COTY awards from the Software and Industry Association. ", "In the professional market, we will continue to add to our lineup of digital products for the medical professionals. We started with Access Medicine which is now used in more than 42 countries and by virtually all U.S. medical schools. Last July we launched Access Surgery. It follows the Access Medicine model and combines leading McGraw-Hill reference text with digital video. This month we will launch Access Emergency Medicine and at mid-year we plan to introduce Access Pharmacy. Other specialties will follow from that. And again, these are all subscription products that sell on a global basis. ", "Summing up then for McGraw-Hill Education, improved prospects and a growing elementary/high school market in 2007, a robust state new adoption market starting in 2007, a growing spectrum of products to serve a diverse el-high market, growing global growth prospects in higher education and professional markets, more growth in digital products as the convergence of technology and content increases the addressable market, and margin expansion in 2007. ", "With that, let\u2019s turn over to the financial services segment and go through those results and prospects. This segment finished the year on an upswing with revenue improving 22.1% in the fourth quarter and with a good pipeline to start 2007. All the more impressive, since the hot U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market started cooling down a bit in 2006. ", "Revenue in 2006 increased 14.4% but by 19.4% on a non-GAAP basis, and that\u2019s reflecting the sale of Corporate Value Consulting in September of 2005. Operating profit increased by 18% and that is reflecting $30 million in incremental expenses for stock-based compensation and a one-time charge for the elimination of the restoration stock option program. The operating margin for the year was 43.8%, up from 42.5% in 2005. Solid growth in equity and fixed income information products and services produced new records at Standard & Poor\u2019s for revenue, operating profit, and operating margins in 2006. ", "The year was marked by solid contributions from rating services, data and information products, and index services. We have said that before and we are confident that we will say it again in 2007. Clearly, the solid and growing line-up at S&P continues to contribute to the sustainability of its performance, while reducing dependence on any single product or asset class. ", "In ratings, we grew solidly domestically and abroad. In the fourth quarter, the share of revenue from international ratings and services topped the 40% mark for the first time in S&P\u2019s history and that was accounting for 41.8% of its revenue, versus 38.4% for the same period last year. ", "For the full year, international produced 38.6% of ratings revenue and that\u2019s up from 37% in 2005. The structured finance market continues to be a strong driver. In the fourth quarter, structured finance\u2019s performance was primarily attributable to growth in the collateralized debt obligations and the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. ", "In the CDO market there was strong investor demand in cash flow and synthetic sectors as well as increases in collateralized loan obligations which benefited from the growth and leveraged loans stimulated by merger and acquisition activity. Asset-backed alert on industry newsletter reported on January 19th that in 2006 S&P, for the ninth straight year, rated more asset mortgage-backed securities than any other agency. The measures are S&P\u2019s ratings of dollar volume issuance and the number of deals. ", "S&P also benefited from a substantial pickup in the corporate market in the fourth quarter. Public finance issuance also finished the year strongly. Some, but not all, of the strength was captured by the quarterly flow by new dollar volume issuance this year. As this bar chart shows, U.S. corporate dollar volume issuance grew year over year in each quarter of 2006 and finished with a surge in the fourth quarter. For the year, U.S. corporate issuance was up 43.8% as investment grade and high yield issuance both set records. ", "Public finance issuance was off about 7% in 2006, but produced a gain of nearly 17% in the fourth quarter as December volume soared. This was the most active December market in public finance since 1985. Seven of the 14 largest deals of the year were sold in the fourth quarter. ", "The U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market rose at the start of 2006, but dollar volume issuance started declining in the third quarter. That trend continued into the fourth quarter, but thanks to the strong start in 2006, the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities issuance of the year finished ahead by about 1.4%. ", "In Europe, the residential mortgage-backed securities market dollar issuance was up for most of the year and was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter. For the year, European issuance in this asset class was up 58.9%. ", "The commercial mortgage-backed securities market produced year-over-year gains and dollar volume issuance for each quarter of 2006 and surged dramatically in the fourth quarter. As you may recall, we started talking about this issuance demand starting to pick up in early 2005 and it has and it is steadily increasing. For the year, commercial mortgage-backed securities dollar volume issuance was up 27.6% in 2006. ", "The commercial market was also very strong in Europe, and especially in the second half as issuance continued to build. For 2006, the commercial mortgage-backed security issuance in Europe was up 37.3%. Asset-backed dollar volume issuance in the United States showed year-over-year gains in the first and the third quarters but ended the year off 4.4%. ", "The market was also strong for ratings and services that are not directly tied to new issuance. These services accounted for 24.5% of ratings in the fourth quarter and 23.9% for the year. We expect revenue in this area to increase again in 2007. These are bank loan ratings, counterparty credit ratings, financial strength ratings, credit estimates. These will all lead to growth. In fact, we expect growth in all asset classes in 2007 except for the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities where issuance will probably decline around 10% or 15%. ", "International growth will be strong again in 2007, with all regions expected to produce increases for the year. We\u2019ve also worked very hard in recent years to reduce our dependence on transaction revenue through the growth of frequent issuer and surveillance programs. A measure of our success is the growth of unearned revenue. The corporation\u2019s unearned revenue grew by more than 15% last year to $983.2 million. The increase is primarily attributable to financial services ratings products. ", "In equity markets, S&P continues to expand and grow. Assets under management and exchange-traded funds based upon S&P indices increased 19.3% in 2006 to $161.2 billion. We will continue to expand and add index services in new asset classes such as real estate. Our goal is to provide an index for every type of investment style. ", "In the fourth quarter, ten new exchange-traded funds based upon S&P indices were introduced bringing the year\u2019s total of new exchange-traded funds to 35. All told, there are now 87 exchange traded funds worldwide using S&P indices and we anticipate 13 more exchange-traded funds will be launched in the first quarter of 2007. ", "There is continuing global demand for our equity and fixed income information products and services. Since we acquired Capital IQ in 2004 the client base has doubled to more than 1,700. Last fall, we added data from S&P ratings to the Capital IQ offering, leveraging and extracting greater value from S&P\u2019s content is a key strategy here and we are pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making. ", "Summing up for financial services, continued strength in ratings, solid growth in international markets, excellent growth in data and information and indices, another year of double-digit top and bottom line growth in 2007, and more margin expansion. ", "With that, let\u2019s turn now to the information and media segment. As we know, this is a segment in transition as we take advantage of new opportunities to deliver information and analytics over the Internet to our customers in the B2B markets. We\u2019re also very pleased with the performance of JD Power and Associates, and you may recall we acquired that in April of 2005. ", "These factors contributed to the 5.7% increase in revenue for the year and the 17.6% decline in operating profit and an operating margin of 5.1%. Operating profit included $14.1 million in incremental expenses for stock-based compensation and a one-time charge for the elimination of the restoration stock option program. It also included restructuring charges of $8.7 million for the employee severance cost for the reduction of approximately 150 positions. It also included a change in revenue recognition for the transformation of suites from primarily a print catalog to a bundled print and online service. As a result of this change, there were reductions of $23.8 million in revenue and $21.1 million in operating profit in the fourth quarter. ", "Favorable developments over certain disputed billings also benefited segment comparisons by $8.3 million. There was also the impact of eliminating Business Week\u2019s European and Asian editions. They produced approximately $26 million in revenue in 2005. ", "The year in advertising was mixed. Political advertising at our broadcasting group was extremely strong in the fourth quarter and for the year. The races for the governor in California and Indiana; there were also contests for the House of Representatives in Denver and Indianapolis; and, you had the issue and the proposition advertising in California. These were all factors in producing more than $16.8 million in political advertising in 2006. Some of that gain was offset by the loss of Monday Night Football at all our ABC affiliates and a decision not to renew the Oprah Winfrey Show in two of our markets, San Diego and Denver. ", "Broadcasting revenue increased 7.5% to $120.6 million for the year and 3.5% in the fourth quarter to $33.6 million. Off a small base, revenue at BusinessWeek.com grew by 45.7% last year, and we are looking for more growth in 2007. Business Week\u2019s ad pages were essentially flat in 2006 and up 1.6% in the fourth quarter. We expect some improvement at Business Week this year. In total, advertising contributed slightly less to the corporation\u2019s revenue in 2006, about 5.3% of our revenues is in advertising, and that compares to 5.6% of the total revenues in 2005. ", "In looking ahead, we expect our information products and services to drive improvement in this segment. We will be delivering higher value-added information to readers and advertisers by focusing on a few areas: news and information in text, audio and video formats; data and analytics and work flow tools and services; search advertising and lead generation and online community portals producing user-generated content. Construction will obviously benefit from the pickup in suites as revenue for the bundled print and online services will be recognized as earned in 2007. This is a significant transformation for a 100-year-old service. ", "JD Power and Associates had a solid gain in the fourth quarter and is poised for another very good year in 2007 and more global expansion. We\u2019re seeing strength in the non-auto segment. Financial services, insurance, real estate and construction all showed gains. As this graph shows, the outlook for the global automotive market over the next several years is very strong, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. In China alone, auto sales are expected to rise in seven years from 6.7 million to 12.9 million units. Given the complex and fast-changing nature of the Chinese automotive market, solid information on industry and customers is critical. That\u2019s why JD Power and Associates last September acquired Automotive Resources Asia which has been specializing in the Asian car markets since 1993. ", "The combination with JD Power which has been providing voice of the customer information in China\u2019s auto market since 2000, adds a whole new dimension to our services for the fast-growing region and enhances our prospects. ", "Additionally, news about oil and pricing in the volatile market will also continue to drive demand for [Platt\u2019s] products and services and we\u2019re pleased with the performance in \u201806 and expect more in \u201807.

", "For the corporation in 2007, we look for double-digit earnings growth, another year of double-digit top and bottom line growth at financial services, solid gains in our school education business, good growth in the global higher education market, more progress in information and media and margin expansion in all three segments. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Bob Bahash and Bob will talk a little bit about our financial performance and our strength there. ", "Bob Bahash", "Thank you, Terry. As part of the McGraw-Hill\u2019s Companies commitment to produce total shareholder value, we have been returning cash to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. We\u2019ve built on that record again in 2006 by returning $1.8 billion to shareholders in this manner. In fact, since 1996 dividends and share repurchases have returned $5.9 billion to McGraw-Hill shareholders. ", "As Terry mentioned earlier, the board of directors reduced the dividend and the share repurchase program at its January meeting which takes place next Wednesday. This morning, I\u2019m going to discuss our strong financial condition at the end of 2006 and provide some indication of what to expect for 2007. ", "We are debt-free. Our cash position at the end of 2006 was $353 million which is $395 million lower than the year end 2005 balance and consists primarily of our foreign holdings. I\u2019ll speak to the specifics of key components of cash flow in detail, but it\u2019s important to note that our strong cash flow for the year, along with our beginning cash balance, was sufficient to fund all operating investments, capital expenditures, pre-publication investments and our return to shareholders in the form of dividends and increased share repurchases, net of option exercise proceeds. ", "We achieved our previously announced 28.4 million share repurchase target for 2006 by repurchasing 2.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. We repurchased the 28.4 million shares at an average price of $54.23 per share, totaling approximately $1.5 billion. 20 million shares remain from the 45 million share repurchase program approved by the board in January of 2006. The fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding -- or WASO, and I am going to refer to this a couple of times, WASO -- for 2006 was 366.9 million shares. That\u2019s a 15.7 million share decrease compared to the full year 2005. ", "The decrease is primarily driven by the weighted impact of the 28.4 million shares repurchased during 2006, partially offset by stock option activity and the 31.7% increase in our stock price in 2006. In the fourth quarter, WASO actually increased 3.4 million shares compared to the third quarter and was influenced by the three factors mentioned above: ", "Now hopefully this illustrates how these factors can influence the WASO calculation using the required treasury stock method of determining outstanding shares. ", "Net interest expense was $14 million for 2006 which is slightly lower than we had projected. This declined to only $70,000 in the fourth quarter, a seasonally strong period of free cash flow as the interest income earned on investments from excess cash balances offset the fixed components of interest expense relating to bank fees, deferred compensation, and the accounting for the Rock-McGraw sale leaseback transaction that occurred in December of 2003. ", "For 2007, we expect the full year of interest expense to range between $16 million and $18 million. This is higher than 2006 as we begin this year with $395 million less cash than the same period last year. 2007 interest includes the same fixed items as 2006 with the largest component being the $9 million for accounting relating to the Rock-McGraw transaction. ", "Now, there are a number of ins and outs affecting 2006 and 2005 for both the full year and the quarter, so I want to point them out now to you. The earnings released this morning reviewed the 2006 earnings results of $2.40 per share. The results include a one-time charge of $0.04 for the elimination of the restoration stock option program; $0.11 for incremental stock-based compensation; and $0.06 in charges for restructuring started in the third quarter and completed in the fourth quarter. ", "The restructuring eliminated approximately 700 positions across the company. The action brought our total restructuring charge for the year to $31.5 million. Now, that compares to 2005\u2019s EPS of $2.21 and that included a $0.04 restructuring charge for employee severance costs related to the reduction of approximately 500 positions across the corporation in the fourth quarter of 2005; and, a $0.03 increase in income taxes on the repatriation of funds made possible by the American Jobs Creation Act and a $0.01 gain on the sale of corporate value consulting. ", "Now looking at the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2006, diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.56 compared to the same period last year. These results include $0.01 for the incremental stock-based compensation; $0.03 restructuring charge for positions eliminated in the fourth quarter; and a $0.04 for a change in revenue recognition, the transformation of suites that we discussed at previous meetings. ", "That compares to 2005\u2019s fourth quarter EPS of $0.50 which included the two items I just mentioned for the full year 2005 EPS, $0.04 restructuring charge and $0.03 increase in income taxes for the repatriation of funds. ", "In the beginning of 2006, we indicated we were transforming suites. The McGraw-Hill Construction Group\u2019s popular Building Products Database from a print catalog to a bundled print and online service. This move resulted in a change in our revenue recognition for the suites product sales. Accounting standards require us to recognize revenue for subscription products over the contract period, rather than solely in the fourth quarter which was how we recognized suites revenue in the past when only the standalone print product was delivered to customers in December. The shift reduced Suites\u2019 fourth quarter 2006 revenue by $23.8 million and operating profit by $21.1 million, or $0.04 per share. The difference between the revenue and operating profit impact is due to the deferral of $2.7 million in related expenses that will be recognized in 2007. ", "In 2006, the company incurred incremental stock-based compensation expense of $85 million, which includes a one-time charge of $23.8 million from the elimination of the company\u2019s restoration stock option program. The $85 million expense represents $0.11 per share for the incremental expensing plus an additional $0.04 one-time charge for the elimination of the restoration program. ", "Now, looking at how this all breaks down between the segments and corporate, McGraw-Hill Education had incremental expenses of $19.6 million for stock-based compensation which includes $4.2 million for the one-time charge. Financial Services had incremental expenses of $30 million for stock-based comp, including $2.1 million for the one-time charge. Information and media, incremental expenses of $14.1 million; that includes $2.7 million for the one-time charge. And finally, for the corporate areas the incremental expenses of $21.4 million, that includes $14.7 million for the one-time charge. ", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at corporate expense. Corporate expense increased $38 million to $163 million for 2006. It includes, of course, the $21.4 million incremental stock-based comp I just mentioned. The full year amount also includes a portion of the restructuring charge of $6.8 million versus $2.8 million of restructuring charges in 2005, as well as a revaluation charge for certain equity venture investments. ", "In 2006, we had dilution of $0.05 from the acquisitions made in 2004 and 2005. In 2007, we expect they will be cash positive. The company, of course, did not make any material acquisition or dispositions in 2006. ", "The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 37.2%. The blended effective income tax rate for 2006 was also 37.2%. For 2007, we expect the rate to be approximately the same as 2006 on a full-year basis. ", "Let\u2019s take a look now at capital expenditures which include prepublication investments and the purchases of property and equipment. Prepublication investments were $87 million in the fourth quarter and $277 million for 2006. This is $19 million higher than in 2005, but lower than our original projection for 2006 due to timing, as well as some efficiencies from our global resource management program. ", "For 2007, our prepublication investments will be about $330 million. As Terry mentioned earlier, we compete with a spectrum of products in the key reading and math markets and these investments are targeted to these opportunities. This level of investment is driven mainly for products we are currently developing to realize significant opportunities in the el-high market in 2007 through 2009. ", "Purchases of property and equipment were $70 million in the fourth quarter and $127 million for the year, which is $6 million higher than in 2005. As we mentioned during the last call, the primary construction phase for our new data center has shifted to 2007. In addition, we anticipate increased technology investments due to the continuing digitization of our products and services. As a result, we project $250 million for 2007 which is a $123 million increase compared to 2006. ", "Now, for some non-cash items. Depreciation was $113 million in 2006; for 2007 we expect $130 million, reflecting the higher level of capital expenditures in 2007 and the full year of depreciation from CapEx made in 2006. Amortization of prepublication costs was $228 million in 2006. For 2007 we expect $260 million, as a result of the new el-high programs we\u2019re publishing to take advantage of the strong adoption opportunities. ", "Amortization of intangibles was $48 million in 2006. We\u2019re expecting $50 million in 2007, virtually flat with the previous year. That brings me to free cash flow. In defining free cash flow, we start with operating cash flow and reduce that amount by certain cash outflows for investing and financing activities that are more reoccurring by nature. As you see from the table, cash provided by operations per GAAP was $1.5 billion for 2006. We then subtract the following which we\u2019ve already talked about. Investments and prepublication costs of $277 million; purchases of property and equipment, $127 million; additions to technology projects, $23 million; and dividends paid to shareholders, $260 million. ", "Under this definition, free cash flow for 2006 was $825 million versus $896 million for 2005. That\u2019s an 8% decrease due to increased investments and a return to a more normalized level of working capital. For 2007, we anticipate free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $750 million, primarily reflecting higher investment spending. We have ample cash and borrowing capacity for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions and to meet our requirements for internal investments. ", "Thank you and now back to Terry. ", "Terry McGraw", "Thanks, Bob. Again, as we entered 2006 we did so knowing that we were going to have a slower education market and we needed to reflect all of the expensing of stock-based compensation. But with all of that, we\u2019re very pleased with how we completed 2006 and we\u2019re pleased that we were able to outperform the guidance that we gave for the full year and for the fourth quarter. ", "Now, that we\u2019re in 2007 and we obviously have a much better look for all of our businesses, we look for the double digit earnings growth for the corporation, another year of double-digit top and bottom for financial services, we\u2019re looking for solid gains in our school education business -- again, good growth in higher education and more progress and information. And again, margin expansion across the board. ", "So with that let me turn it back to Don \u2013 and again, one other aspect again. We\u2019re using $2.50 as the base for our double-digit earnings guidance for 2007, and again, we arrived at that figure by taking the GAAP earnings at $2.40 and adding to that the nonrecurring charges in 2006 of $0.04 for the elimination of the stock restoration program and $0.06 for restructuring, so $2.50 is the base line for that. ", "Now, back to Don. ", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for phone participants. (Caller Instructions) We are now ready to take the first question. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs. ", " Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you, good morning. Terry or Bob, can you talk please about the operating margin performance in the financial services segment? You had shown some fairly impressive year-to-year gains in the first three quarters, the margin down in the fourth quarter. Anything particularly we should note that's driving that? ", "Harold McGraw", " Well, Peter, good morning. Even with a softer residential mortgage-backed market the pipeline has just been very strong. And again, the shift in leadership between some of the structured market asset classes as well as impressive buildup on the corporate and government side has allowed us to grow a little quicker. Also, as I mentioned in the remarks, the non-traditional products and services also contributed, as well as the growth on the data and information side and on the indices. ", "So it was just across the board a very good year for S&P and we expect a very good year in 2007. Bob, do you want to add anything? ", " Bob Bahash", " If could I add two points there: one, because of the very strong performance year there was a true-up in incentives for the various businesses as well. And last year, Peter, we had divested CVC in the third quarter so that comparison then therefore is now out. It was in the comparison on the year-to-year basis for the first three quarters, not in there for the fourth quarter. That also influenced the comparisons. ", " Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", " Wouldn't that have a positive impact, though, on margin performance in the fourth quarter versus a year ago? ", " Bob Bahash", " The CVC, when you look at our performance each quarter this year, of course it was down; if you are comparing to last year, because CVC's margins were lower than the total, last year's margins would have been lower for the first three quarters. Now you are getting more to a normalized margin for the businesses in the fourth quarter. So the comparison obviously would be tighter. ", " Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", " Even so, the incremental margin doesn't look that impressive versus what you have been doing. You mentioned specifically the true-up in bonuses. Would that be enough to account for the year-to-year differential in margin or are there some other mix issues? ", " Bob Bahash", " There's nothing out of the ordinary, or nothing unusual, but the incentive true-up clearly was part of that, but there's nothing unusual in terms of the overall mix of different businesses, different activities. ", " Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", " One last thing and I'll let go of this. For '07 then would you expect the operating margin in the financial services segment to be roughly flat on a year-to-year basis? ", " Bob Bahash", " Again, the way we're looking at it at this point, I think from a guidance standpoint Peter, we're saying that we expect margin improvement. At this point of the year, I think that's a good place to leave it. But we expect more margin improvement. ", " Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", " Thank you. ", "Operator", " The next question is from David Lewis - JP Morgan. ", " David Lewis - JP Morgan", "Quick question, can you guys elaborate on the international pipeline for issuance and just related to that, an update on some of the emerging opportunities? For example, CRISIL, how that's progressing? Thanks. ", "Harold McGraw", " Sure. First of all, again, as you can see in the numbers and as the percent of international revenues is increasing, that number will continue. What we have said is that we think that probably by 2010, about half of ratings revenue will be coming from outside the United States and I think that's a pretty good benchmark at this point. So it's very strong. ", "It's very strong across the board. It's strong on the corporate side but it's also strong increasingly on the structured finance side. As some of the new issuance numbers, the residential mortgage-backed market is benefiting nicely both in Europe and in parts of Asia, also in parts of Latin America; Mexico as well, on that one. So the international pipeline is strong and we'll continue to gain strength on that one. ", "CRISIL is a wonderful example. CRISIL is a terrific example of what we're able to do when markets change and markets grow. India is gaining a lot of strength, it's growing quite well on the financial services side and is benefiting nicely from that, and so are we. CRISIL has been a wonderful addition and not just on the ratings side. As important as that is, it is also expanding in terms of all of the information and data services as that market begins to show more development. So we're very, very pleased with where CRISIL is and we expect a fair bit of growth coming out of India for 2007. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Barlow - Prudential. ", " Steve Barlow - Prudential", " Good morning. There's been a lot of focus on the adoption states. Could you talk about what the market and what you feel the open territories can grow in the education business in 2007? ", "To drill down a little bit on Capital IQ, you talk about being pleased with the operation so far. Is there a way to quantify that a bit? Margins doubled since you bought it, margins are now in the low double-digits, the high double-digits, any particular metrics you can give us on that business? Thanks. ", "Harold McGraw", "Steve, obviously the state adoption market for 2007 is going to be a much better opportunity than it was last year. We are looking at somewhere around a 15% increase in the addressable market and we expect to do well. You are going to have programs like K-12 science in California, you are going to have reading and literature in Indiana for the elementary and middle school, you've got Georgia elementary and middle school math; you've got Florida is coming out with K-12 health and world languages. Texas has got middle school and secondary school math. So you have got a very, very good schedule and you have got good breadth in terms of state adoption monies. ", "Obviously at this time of the year the open territories number is a difficult one to project. It was essentially flat in 2006, so we're looking for an increase here. I would say mid single-digits is probably a good estimate for right now. I think by the time we get through March and April we'll probably have a better indication of whether to strengthen that or not, but at this point I'd say about 5%. ", "On Capital IQ, again, the focus here, Steve, has all been on the revenue-generating side. Customer expansion, content expansion, and building out on this platform. We are very excited about their role as a platform and a data aggregator, and its competitive posture in the market. We are with some 1,700 clients now, that's double where we were when we acquired it, and we will do everything we can to continue that customer expansion, and at the same time, investing in building out on the content side. As we talked about a little bit earlier, some of the other S&P information that we have added to that content, but you will see more on that side. So the revenue growth is quite strong and we're pleased with that, but that's where our focus is at this point in terms of building out on it. ", " Steve Barlow - Prudential", "Would it be fair to say then if the number of clients is double that your revenue has potentially doubled since you bought it? ", "Harold McGraw", " Yes. ", "Operator", " The next question is from Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley. ", " Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, yes. Two questions. Just first financial, I think in the press release you gave some color on the increase in financial services segment. It looks like 75% was from structured finance and corporate and munis. Can we take away from that potentially that the non-ratings businesses in financial services, the growth was more subdued in the fourth quarter versus earlier in the year? ", "Harold McGraw", " No. ", " Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", " Can you elaborate on that? ", "Harold McGraw", " Again, you've got several components here. You are quite right in terms of the emphasis was on the structured finance market. That has been going on and will continue to go on for sometime. Again, it's not only the breadth of the structured market but it's also the geographic expansion as capital market growth really wants to go in that direction. ", "When you start taking a look at the other components, the non-traditional ratings business, when you start taking a look at the data information and the indices, those are all quite strong. All at a time when we're spending a lot of investment also in building out as we were just talking about the Capital IQ platform, on that one. So again, we have seen a nice contribution across the board, but obviously led by the very strong performance in structured. ", "Bob, do you want to add anything? ", " Bob Bahash", " We had very good performance when you were earlier referring to the non-ratings side and the growth rates that we had been experiencing for some of the different segments, data and information, some of those particular product and services, as well as our index services, continued to be very, very strong or double-digit growth rates. ", " Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "Just on this issue and then I will move on, can you say whether the growth in the ratings business was higher or lower than in the non-ratings business? ", "Harold McGraw", " Higher. ", " Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", " Higher. Okay. And then just on education: in '06, you guys spoke about some areas of disappointment in California and Florida. At what point did you get the sense that expectations were a little bit too high and the year was not going to come in as expected? Where I'm going with this is how much you have a visibility in terms of new state adoptions. ", "Harold McGraw", " The issue again was in the elementary side of Florida, and on California, both were very different issues. In the science adoption on elementary in Florida, because of the overall opportunity and the size of the opportunity, we decided not to go with a rigid state-specific offering. It was state-specific, but it was coming off of a very successful national science program and that was the issue there. Again, in the middle school and the secondary school, those were very, very strong performances, and it carried the aggregate capture rate up. ", "In California with social studies, it was a very different issue. California was looking for a very rigid state-specific offering which we complied with. At the end of the day, because of the fact that it wasn't being tested and the emphasis was on reading and math, that California wanted to go with a much diluted version rather than a hard state-specific. ", "There were very different issues. It's not in terms of the quality of the program it is about markets conditions on those. Again, the middle school on social studies was quite strong on that part. So overall, it's just the elementary side and we have taken a lot of pains to fix that, and that was a part of the reorganization that we talked about last year, and they're out, and we fully expect to get back to the capture rates that we anticipate for planning purposes every year. ", " Bob Bahash", " Lisa, with regard to the specific timing of when we had indications, different districts, some of the larger ones -- Dade and such -- they are making their calls at different times. So you are getting indications, I guess probably in the February/March period, but in terms of when we really had a pretty good handle on where we were coming out, it's really into about the middle of the second quarter that you have a pretty good idea where your won-loss rate is coming out. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", " Thank you. I think I have three questions. Bob, just following-up on Peter's question that incentive true-up that you referred to for bonuses, can you quantify that? Is that closer to $1 million or is that a $10 million type of number? Then I have a follow-up. ", " Bob Bahash", " Mike, that's not something that I could actually quantify or that I really care to quantify. This is a business that has performed extremely well and we want to make certain that we first of all, reward the employee population in the best manner and be very, very competitive and we make certain that our total pay package, including incentives and such is going to be very attractive to maintain the best quality. So it's not $1 million, let's put that it way. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", " Fair enough. On your guidance just a clarification, you have said margins up at all three segments this year, and you have said financial services revenue is up over 10%. Is it fair to say you're looking for mid single-digit revenue growth at the other two segments? ", " Bob Bahash", "We're not forecasting, at this point in time, revenue for the other businesses. What we're comfortable in talking about is revenue for financial services, operating profits for financial services, both double-digit; EPS growth double-digit for the corporation and margin improvement for all three segments. ", "Harold McGraw", "Michael, obviously with the base in '06, we're looking for a very good performance on the education side. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "With that suites transformation, that $24 million does, is that fully incremental in '07? ", " Bob Bahash", " It moves from 2006 to 2007. I'm not sure what you mean. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", " So that boosts up your growth rate by a couple hundred basis points? ", " Bob Bahash", "Yes. Well, you're coming off a year where we didn't have it. So clearly that's going to be an additional element. It's simply a shift, as I mentioned earlier. We had always recognized that revenue in December. Now, with the print and online versions, you're taking effectively that same amount of money that would have been recognized in December of 2006 and is being recognized over 2007. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "Thank you, and I have one last question. You mentioned on the testing business, I think you said revenues were down 13% last year. Can you just talk a little bit about profitability of that unit, perhaps relative to the rest of the education business? ", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, Michael, we don't break that one out specifically. But again, this is a business that is in transformation. Again, we were very, very strong as a high-stakes tester, the summative testing market. Where the market is going is obviously into the formative side of assessment. The production infrastructure for the high stakes is different than it is for the low stakes testing, or the formative side because of the fact that speed and customization are the requirements and therefore, the investment that we're making on the technology side is having an impact on the testing business at this point. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", " Thank you for your time. ", "Operator", " The next question is from Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus. ", " Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning, guys. Terry, I wonder if you could fist start to talk about some of the keys to reversing the margin erosion you experienced in education? What are some of the swing factors you look at for '07 to boosting margins for that business? ", "Harold McGraw", " Well, there's a number of things in all of that. Certainly, a lot of the structuring issues that we have taken place, we're looking for more of response on. We talked about that in terms of combining the elementary and the high school operations and those centers of excellence. ", "You're also going to benefit from the global transformation project in terms of the efficiency of the order to cash methodology. You're also going to have some impact on the global resource management as we have outsourced some of those capabilities, but also, Drew, you've got the top line opportunity. With a much bigger addressable market, we fully expect to get back to the capture rates that we expect and I think that's going to have an impact as well. ", " Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Fair enough. Terry, is it possible to quantify the cost savings associated with the elimination of the 700 positions? ", "Harold McGraw", " It will have some impact. ", " Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Shifting gears to the financial services business, obviously some strength, surprisingly strength in the public finance realm in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe talk about what the contributing factors were to that and what you're likely or expecting to see into '07? ", "Harold McGraw", " Yes, I think that overall, I would say from a state standpoint the financial picture is quite bright. Budgets are very strong. We saw in the '05/'06 period a real slowdown in the new issuance market, reflective of that kind of strength. What we're seeing now is a little bit more aggressive budget as people are dealing with things like education reform and the like, and you're seeing some financing starting to pick up. ", "I would not look for robust growth here but certainly coming off of a very quiet '06, I think you're going to see a nice gain here. ", " Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", " The next question is from Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse. ", " Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. In education, Terry, you talked a little bit about the textbook market for options, a little about open territories. What about the supplemental market? How should we think about the performance there in '06 and your expectations or your assumptions for '07 in terms of revenue growth or market share? ", "Harold McGraw", "Brandon, the alternative basal or supplemental market has been a huge component for us because it's an area that allows us, obviously, to be able to address more and more of a particular market. It used to be that the lion's share was through a basal program, and now with the alternative basal and getting into reform and skill-based areas, having offerings in all of those areas gives us quite a leg up. ", "We expect growth in this area, and we expect the continuation of strength in some of the areas that we talked about in the remarks having to do with the mathematics with Everyday Mathematics and Impact Mathematics and the continuance of the very, very strong phonics-based Open Reading, and some of our new products in that area. So that will be an important part. ", " Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", " As we look at the adoption cycle in the next couple of years, we've talked about this in previous calls, but is there any trend in any of the major states to not do away with the formal textbook as the center of the learning, but to go towards more of a supplemental outlook for the teachers to use, not quite the same rigid philosophy, textbook centric? I'm trying to get a feel for the market share between supplemental and textbook, especially in the bigger states? ", "Harold McGraw", " It all depends on how people are addressing the intervention and remedial markets. States are doing that in a different way. Ours is to have a very strong alternative basal and a strong basal program and therefore make it fungible. We can go in any direction to build on the solution that they are looking for. I do think and we work very hard in terms of anticipating direction in the market that you are seeing, like we faced in social studies in California, an emphasis on certain areas and a de-emphasis on some and how to respond to some of those. I think the quicker we get to an online environment for some of those it's going to make it easier, and certainly I think the financials will reflect that as well. ", "But we work on that state by state but, yes, I think that everybody is looking at alternative ways of building content and how to do things or connect assessment into the content and the curriculum, and we will continue to work with states to do that. But you are not going to replace the textbook as the core component at this point. What you are going to do is you're going to be able to expand online participation in those markets. ", " Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", " One final one. Moody's has talked this past year or so about catching up on staff, especially international markets to keep up with the growth in structured products. Maybe if you could give us some color on staffing levels within the ratings business and how you see those progressing? Do you think you've got the right people in the right places to keep up with the strong growth in some of those complex products? ", "Harold McGraw", " I won't address Moody's, I'll let them do that. But from our standpoint, remember, as part of the global expansion what we have done is developed capabilities in specific markets, and therefore as you do so, initially your margins are going to be a little bit lower until you can get to a level of revenue base to get you to margin levels that we see domestically, and that will continue. ", "We are very competitive around the world, and we have people in those markets. So I don't see a huge ramping up for these activities. Another thing that's very, very important and one of the things that we do a lot of is a lot of cross-training, such that as you have shifts in the marketplace i.e. from let's say residential mortgage-backed securities to commercial mortgage-backed securities, that we can move staff around easily so that we can pick up some of that transaction capability. ", "So again, you have to have a very strong training and development function. We have very, very strong representation in specific markets, so that we can pick up on that demand. ", " Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", " The next question is from William Bird - Citigroup. ", " William Bird - Citigroup", " Terry, I was wondering if you could talk about your current thoughts on acquisitions and also you have laid out a goal of education margin of 20% in 2010. That would imply about 160 basis points a year improvement. Just wondering if you expect even progress or some different pattern? Thank you. ", "Harold McGraw", "Well, again, on the acquisition market, as Bob said and as we've said before, we were a little quieter in 2006. Some of the valuations that we saw and some of the things that we would like to do were in our opinion, too rich. When you're seeing certain kind of acquisitions at four, five, six times revenues, you can't get adequate returns on that, and therefore we think that in terms of use of free cash flow, going for a higher share repurchase and dividend made a lot more sense, provided that we're maintaining the organic growth investment required to be competitive in our market. So there was a bit of a shift on that one. ", "We'll see, as we get into this year, certainly I think that the 17 rate hikes last year are certainly going to slow down growth and by the time we get into, I don't know, somewhere mid-year, I think the Federal Reserve again will reflect that slowdown in growth and will start cutting interest rates. ", "As you take out some of the excess liquidity in the market, I think that valuations could become better on that one. So we're very active. We've got a pipeline there and we continue to monitor things, and where they make sense strategically, either from a platform standpoint or a component standpoint we'll address that. But we need to see valuations that are more conducive to the kinds of returns that we expect to get. ", "On the education market, again, the 20% goal by 2010 there's no change in that. We certainly realize that we have a bit of a hill to climb here in all of this. 2006 was an unusual year and 2007, 2008, and 2009 are going to be quite strong and given some of the things that we've talked about before in terms of GDP and global resource management that push to online the higher contributions and the higher ed in international and professional, we will definitely be making significant improvement on that part. ", "Now again, when you start projecting 2010 a lot of factors between now and then and will take place. But we expect significant margin gain and having a goal of 20% by 2010 I think is a responsible thing. ", " Bob Bahash", " If I could just add to that, Bill. Your suggestion of a linear approach there would be nice, but that's not going to happen. ", "With regard to the opportunities coming up in 2007, they are significant. As Terry pointed out, in addition to the global resource management, global transformation project, outsourcing, offshoring activities like that, it's capture rates on the top line which is going to be critical, but as you know, for some of these major adoptions coming up in these various states there's a fair amount of upfront marketing costs in terms of promotion, free with order, sampling costs, and things like that. Of course, your amortization costs are higher in that first year. So that has to be reflected in. ", "When you look at the life cycle of an adoption and the significant capture rates one achieves, the profitability really flows in in the later years because that's when you basically don't have your marketing costs, your amortization costs are much lower and with the higher capture rates you're now filling replacement orders at a pretty higher rate. ", "So those are just some of the factors. So you shouldn't be thinking of this from a standpoint of a linear approach, because we have big adoptions coming up, some bigger upfront costs to address, but we're looking at some significant capture rates because we're excited about the programs that we have. ", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch. ", " Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. I just wanted to get back to the testing market for a second. Terry, you sound a little bit more optimistic about the outlook for testing in '07, but you also mentioned that you discontinued some lower margin contracts. I just wonder, do you think that testing revenues could actually be up in 2007? ", "Harold McGraw", " Yes, thanks, Karl. We broke that out to show the investment as well as the shifts in the marketplace. I would expect, obviously coming off of a lower '06 I would have a higher expectation for revenue growth in '07. But again, this is a market that is in transformation. It's a critical piece of the market because of the No Child Left Behind standards. You're adding science testing in '07. So the market opportunities start to expand; but again, the investment is on being able to develop a fast, customized, formative product into the market which would be state-specific and it requires a technology base that allows you to customize and to have that instant return in terms of the test grading on that part. ", "So this will be a business that will continue to require investment and it will put pressure obviously on margins but the revenue opportunity is a growing one.

I'm Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations for the McGraw Hill Companies. With me today are Harold McGraw, Chairman, President, and CEO, and Robert J. Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the corporation. ", "This morning we issued a news release with our first quarter 2007 results. We trust you have all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of it and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at http://www.McGraw-Hill.com/investor_relations.

However, this call is for investors, and we ask that questions from media be directed to Mr. Steve Weiss in our New York office at 212-512-2247, subsequent to this call. ", "Today's update will last approximately an hour. After the presentation we'll open the meeting to questions and answers. ", "Now it's my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President, and CEO of the McGraw Hill companies, Terry McGraw. ", "Harold McGraw", "OK, thank you Don, and good morning everyone and welcome to our review of the McGraw Hill Companies first quarter results. Joining me today is Bob Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and we'll begin by discussing our results for the first quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year. Bob will then review our financial performance, and obviously, as always, we'll then go in any direction after that anybody would like to go. ", "Earlier this morning we announced our first quarter results. We reported earnings per share of $0.40. That includes a $0.03 gain on the sale of a mutual fund data business in March. Revenue grew by 13.7% to $1.3 billion and margin improvement in all three segments. ", "Historically, the first quarter is the smallest each year, but clearly we're off to very good start to achieve our goal of producing double-digit earnings growth in 2007. As we look ahead, we see that inflation is under control at 2.5%. The US Gross Domestic Product is growing at about 2.4%, and the unemployment rate is holding at about 4.4%. This makes all in all, a pretty good situation. ", "David Weiss, the chief economist at Standard & Poor\u2019s, was looking for a Fed rate probably going down, probably by mid year. He now thinks that's closer to the end of the year, but that the next move will still be down. ", "Again, David Weiss our chief economist believes that the housing starts and sales are bottoming out after a 30% decline. Housing prices are down 3%, and will probably decline another 5% between now and the end of the year. Non-commercial construction is doing very well, state revenues are solid, bond rates are stable, and the Federal Reserve has held the funds rate at 5.25% since last June, and no change is expected soon. One cut to 5% again is possible by the end of the year. ", "With that as background, let us look at our operating results. We'll begin with McGraw Hill Education. With that background, we expect Education to be an important contributor to our performance in 2007. We are encouraged by the start this year, even in a seasonally slow quarter. Revenue increased 5.6%. The operating loss was reduced by 6.6%. Costs and expenses are under tight control, and rose only about 2.7%. ", "The higher education professional and international group revenue grew by 11.5%, to $186.9 million, and contributed 56% to the first-quarter revenue. School education group revenue was up 1.2% to $144.8 million. ", "Let's take a closer look at those results. In the K-12 instructional market, the first quarter represents, as we all know, less than 10% of the full year. Sales in this period tend to consist largely of residual or supplemental orders, plus some early new adoptions, which may arrive toward the end of March. The pattern was skewed in the first quarter last year, because we booked 9 million in late orders from Texas for music, health, and some online programs. Obviously, this did not repeat in 2007. ", "We closed most of the gap. A key driver was March orders from North Carolina for our K-5 music program and vocational, family, and consumer science programs for grades 6-12. More important are the earlier indicators that our newly integrated school team is performing effectively, and that the strength we expected in the state adoption market is starting to materialize. ", "These trends take on added importance this year because we have stepped up our participation in a growing state new-adoption market. In 2006 we participated in only 80% of the state new adoption market. This year we have products for virtually the entire state new adoption market, which we expect to grow 10-15%, or between $750-800 million. ", "As this chart shows, we believe the state new adoption market is poised for growth for the rest of the decade. It's much too soon to make predictions on our results this year. Sales campaigns are running at full throttle, but I can report that we are very pleased with the early feedback. Science in California and South Carolina, math in Texas and New Mexico, and music in North Carolina look very promising at this time. ", "We are also encouraged by the early showing of our middle school products in the second year of the California social studies adoption taking shape in some large urban market and that would include New York City, Boston, Milwaukee and Washington D.C. We\u2019ve already realized some substantial sales in Washington D.C. for K-5 Science and 6-12 Social Studies. We\u2019re optimistic about our opportunities in the open territories. We\u2019re competing with new products in K-5 Science, 6-12 Literature, and the new editions of everyday mathematics and open court reading. We are also pleased with the early showing of a new supplemental product called science snapshot. ", "Science poses its own special challenge to elementary school teachers who typically are trained as reading specialists. Today, these teachers must help students learn the concepts and language of science so that they can score well on the new high stakes test as mandated by \u2018no child left behind\u2019. These science tests start this academic year in elementary, middle, and in high school. Preparing students for those tests is not a simple matter and when you realize that the complex concepts like photosynthesis are introduced in the curriculum as early as the third grade. ", "To provide a classroom solution we combined video, DVDs, and print, to create a new program called \u2018Science Snapshots\u2019 for use in the third, fourth, and fifth grades. The program includes 15 hours of video, so students will have a familiar way to see and hear, as well as read about science. And once again we provide materials students can use to work independently on the computer. We believe that creating materials that address multiple learning styles of today\u2019s students is the route to success in the classroom and to the market place. ", "In the testing market we\u2019ve benefited from increases in custom work for statewide assessment programs in Georgia, Colorado, Indiana, and Florida. Sales of off the shelf test products were flat in the first quarter. ", "As I pointed out earlier, we had double digit growth in the first quarter at the higher education, professional, and international levels, and we\u2019re quite pleased. In the U.S higher education there is a phenomenon that we call the echo effect, second semester ordering late in the year that echoes your success in the peak third quarter. ", "When the second semester business arrives is not entirely predictable. Some years it shows up in September, other yeas it shows up in January. Our higher education group heard the echo in January. We had a very strong January and that contributed to the solid growth that we experienced with higher education products around the world in the first quarter. ", "As you may know, we have three major imprints in this market: Science, Engineering and Mathematics; Business and Economics; and Humanities, Social Sciences, and Languages. All three produced solid gains in the first quarter. We\u2019re seeing increased demand for our digital homework manager products, particularly in world languages, accounting, math and economics. ", "Our new on-line courses are getting a favorable response in the market. Using technology to create new products and incremental revenue is a key strategy. We also are making real headway in the professional markets where we have launched a number of new on-line products. ", "Last July we introduced Harrison\u2019s practice which marked our entrance into the emerging patient care market. Harrison\u2019s practice combines content from the Harrison\u2019s editorial team and experts in the field of internal medicine, with an easy to use interface on a mobile platform which makes it a true work flow tool for physicians in an ambulance in an emergency room or in a doctor\u2019s office. ", "Last week we launched Access Pharmacy, an on-line product designed to keep pace with the changing demands of pharmaceutical education. This is a growing market. It is estimated that in five years nearly 300,000 practicing pharmacists will be needed to serve our aging population. That\u2019s a 30% increase compared to 2002 and that statistic is from the Department of Labor. ", "For Access Pharmacy we are leveraging the content of some of our classic reference texts, including Good and Gillman\u2019s \u2018The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\u2019. ", "Access Pharmacy also offers a fully integrated drug database in English and Spanish. Access Pharmacy joins Access Surgery and Access Emergency Medicine in our line up for ready access resources for medical professionals. More digital products for major medical specialties are on the drawing board. ", "So let\u2019s sum up the outlook for education. In the market we expect 10-15% growth for the state new adoption market. We expect 3-4% growth in the open territory and industry growth of 5-7% based on our new products and greater market participation in 2007. We expect to outperform the industry. In the U.S. college and university market, we expect growth at about 4% based on our plans we also expect to outperform this market and we expect margin expansion for this segment in 2007. ", "One final point about the education market, the competitive landscape is changing. Some are exiting, some are arriving. We have our plans in place to take advantage of growing global opportunities and the increased enrollment in the years ahead and it is clear to us that you can\u2019t sustain a knowledge economy without knowledge workers and that\u2019s why education today more than ever before is a necessity for our world and a growing opportunity for our team of professionals who know this market so very well. ", "With that, let\u2019s turn to the financial services side. By virtually any measure, financial services has had an exceptional first quarter. Revenue increased 21.5%. Operating profit was up 38.3% and the operating margin expanded to 47.7%. Now that includes a $17.3 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the mutual fund data business in March. ", "There were many contributors to this outstanding performance. Certainly world liquidity is extremely plentiful. We continued to operate in a very favorable interest rate environment. Spreads remain tight, investor demand for fixed income instruments is strong. Our diversified portfolio fired on all cylinders. Both our domestic and international rating revenue grew a double digit rate with international outpacing the U.S performance. Corporate and government ratings were strong. Structured finance was robust again and globally. Products and services such as bank loan ratings that are not tied to the public new issue market grew substantially. Data and information products grew rapidly. Index services continued to expand. ", "We expected double digit growth on the top and bottom line this year in financial services even though we forecasted a 10-15% decline in the issuance of the U.S residential mortgage bank securities. Clearly we have gotten off to a very strong start in 2007, and let me be clear there will be more double digit growth and margin expansion throughout the balance of the year in financial services although probably not at the exceptional rate of growth that we enjoyed in the first quarter but still very solid double digit growth. ", "Let\u2019s look at the situation in more detail. Corporate Issuance in the United States set a record in the first quarter. It was up 43% to $336 million. Both investment grade and high yield markets were strong performers. Strong merger and acquisition activity in a favorable financing environment are making this possible. The demand for corporate continues unabated this year. Insurance companies and pension funds have been consistent buyers, snapping up bonds at five and ten year maturities in portfolios that are coming to term. ", "As well, innovation in derivative markets is also attracting a growing number of new high yield investors to participate in this market. Corporate fundamentals remain sound and we look for continued growth both here and abroad in this important market. ", "Public finance benefited from a pick up in refunding and new money issuance. The environment is favorable. There\u2019s an expanding group of buyers and an increase in asset allocations to higher quality investments by aging baby boomers. We expect a good year in public finance although refunding is expected to moderate somewhat. ", "Structured finance produced another strong quarter, despite a 10.8% decline in the U.S residential mortgage bank securities issuance. As I pointed out earlier we anticipated a 10-15% decline in the U.S residential mortgage bank securities issuance this year. A slow in-housing sector, rising mortgage rates, and fewer housing starts were factors in shaping our forecast. As part of its ongoing ratings and surveillance process for residential mortgage back securities, S&P carefully monitors trends in the housing and mortgage finance market, consumer credit, and in the economy overall. ", "Last spring, little over a year ago, S&P foresaw the trend in the quality of mortgage lending that led to the concerns that had arisen in the sub-prime market today. As a result of the deteriorating credit quality of certain sub-prime mortgage loans of 2006, S&P (inaudible) the credit support necessary for a rating by 50% compared to transactions from 2005. ", "While there is a lot going on in this sub-prime market, nothing has occurred so far this year to cause us to materially change our expectations on the level of issuance that we originally anticipated for 2007. It's also worth pointing out that the US residential mortgage backed securities market has not come to a dead stop in 2007, not with the $254.1 billion in issuance in the first quarter. ", "In Europe, residential mortgage backed securities had a very strong quarter and the outlook is positive. Stable economic conditions combined with moderate home price growth in most European countries continues to feel the demand for mortgage credit. We also anticipate some residential mortgage backed securities activity in a merging market, including Russia and South Africa. ", "And we start the second quarter with a very good pipeline. The commercial mortgage backed securities market issuance was also strong in the first quarter. We saw steady improvement in Europe. Drivers of US commercial mortgage backed security include strong commercial real estate fundamentals, historically low interest rates, the refinancing of the maturing deals, and rising property values. And the pipeline looks very good. ", "In the US asset backed securities market, credit card and student loan activity offset the slump in auto loan asset backed securities. Credit card and student loans should keep this market growing. Growth in the European asset backed securities market was driven by small business loans, auto loans, leases, and equipment leases. ", "The outlook in Europe is also solid. Basil should have a positive influence on this market as consumer banks restructured the risk on their balance sheets to adjust to capital adequacy ratios. ", "We also saw robust growth in the US and European collateralized debt obligation market. In the United States, collateralized debt obligation issuants, or CDOs, was up 154% in the first quarter. Our expectation coming into this year was that the growth rate in CDO issuance would slow from the torrent pace that we saw in 2006. While the first quarter was strong, we expect the growth rate to slow in subsequent quarters and the assumption is already baked into our expectations. ", "Key factors in the US CDO market in the first quarter were concerns about widening spread resulting from credit quality deterioration in the sub-prime market and an increase in collateralized loan obligations resulting from the strength in the corporate loan market. ", "Although spreads did widen in the first quarter due to the sub-prime issuance, they have lightened a bit since the end of the quarter. There's a general agreement that spreads may not change or if they do they could widen slightly during the remainder of the year. Our current estimates for the CDO market are based on such a scenario. S&P does not expect dramatic widening of spread unless there is a shock of some sort to the system triggering some dramatic deterioration and that we don't have baked in. ", "US CDOs will continue to benefit from strong investor demand and broader acceptance of structures such as collateralized debt obligations of commercial real estate. There's a constant innovation taking place in the CDO space with respect to structures and the use of underlying collateral. This is not limited to the United States by any means and we also see more growth in Europe. ", "S&P produced significant gains in products and services that are not directly linked to the public debt issuance. These services which account for 26.3% of ratings revenue in the first quarter are another important measure of the diversity that we have created in the S&P portfolio. Bank loan ratings were a key driver of this growth. We anticipate more growth this year from bank loan ratings, outer party credit ratings, financial strength ratings, derivatives, and risk services. ", "S&P also benefited from solid growth of its product and services for equity market. The capital IEQ product continues to grow rapidly and now has more than 1,900 clients. We have also increased the number of subscribers here and abroad from some of our other information products: ratings direct, ratings express, and compustat express B. ", "We continue to expand our index services. At the end of the first quarter there were 113 exchanged traded funds linked to S&P indices, 85 in the United States and 28 outside the United States. Our S&P Citigroup indices form the backbone of a new fast growing business for bench mark indices, index data, and custom indices. ", "At the end of March, assets under management in exchange traded funds based on S&P indices increased 23.7% to $170.3 billion. We also benefited in the first quarter from the increased trading of derivative contracts based on S&P indices especially the E-mini which is traded on the Chicago mercantile exchange. Average daily vibe for the E-mini contracts for the first quarter was $1,376,979. ", "So summing up for financial services, more double digit growth and margin expansion for the balance of the year although probably not at the exceptional rate of growth produced in the first quarter. ", "And now let's go over to the information and media segment. ", "Revenue increased 4.1%. Operating profit was up $9.9 billion up from $1.7 million for the period last year. The operating margin improved to 4.2%. An important factor was the transformation last year from a primarily print catalogue to a bumble print and online service for the construction industry. ", "Because of the change, revenue is now earned throughout the year. As a result of the change, Sweets contributed $6.5 million in revenue and $5.8 million in operating profit to this segment in the first quarter. ", "Revenue for the business to business group grew by 7.5% in the first quarter to $212.3 million. This group includes some of our best known brands: Business Week, JD Power and Associates, Platts, Royal Construction, and Aviation Week. Sweets' transformation in growth and (inaudible) real time new services for oil, natural gas, and power market were key contributors. ", "Business Week's Global Edition was off 3% in the first quarter. Broadcasting revenues fell 18.8% in the first quarter. For broadcasting there were three major influences in the first quarter, certainly the absence of political advertising, the loss of the Super Bowl, and the decision not to renew Oprah Winfrey shows in two of our markets, and pacing for the second quarter is off about 14%. ", "This segment is in transition. We pointed out that before that the internet is reshaping the business to business market to add value to our audience. We're making progress in the new digital world. ", "I've already recited the transformation in Sweets in the construction market. In the energy market, traders are looking for better tools to help them work with real time information. Earlier this month we took an important new step to increase the efficiency and the transparency of physical oil markets. ", "Platts E-window is a new online tool using leading net technology to significantly improve our service to traders who use our daily price assessments as bench marks in the oil market. This is a solution with real promise. Benchmark prices are increasingly used as the basis for industry contracts, financial risk management, and for cash settlement of future contracts, traded at commodity exchanges literally around the world. ", "With globalization and technology making markets more dynamic than ever before, the need for reliable transparent benchmarks and other critical news and analysis of such strategic commodities like oil and steel are helping to drive growth in our real time subscription services. ", "We're also expanding by licensing our intellectual property for use in broader financial and future markets. The most recent example is last week's announcement by the Intercontinental exchange. ", "It has selected one of our bench marks, Platts Divide price assessment, as the basis for cash settlements on a new crude oil futures contract. BusinessWeek.com continues to improve its performance with increases with advertising and unique visitors compared to last year and we continue to make investments in this product. ", "Building communities is an important aspect of our new digital world. That's why ArchitecturalRecord.com now makes it possible for architects to post their work on its website. The site includes blogs and a rating system that encourages readers to participate by evaluating the projects that appear online and in the publication. Our objective is to make it easy for readers to share their work and to interact with their peers and with our editors. Not bad for a 116 year old publication. ", "OK, summing up for the information in media, a soft start in advertising particularly on broadcasting as it was a non-political year. And to complete for the corporation overall, summing up, some very encouraging indications in education, a strong start in financial services, progress in information and media, market expansion in all three segments, and our guidance for 2007, double digit earnings growth in 2007. ", "OK with that let me hold it there. Let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer and his report. ", " Robert J. Bahash", "Thank you Terry. We mentioned during our January conference call that we intended to purchase 15 million shares in 2007 under the share repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors in January of 2006. We elected to accelerate our program and purchase 13.2 million shares during the first quarter on a trade date basis at a total cost of $842 million. We expect to purchase the remaining 1.8 million shares during the balance of 2007. Of the $842 million total amount, approximately $231 million was settled and funded at the beginning of the second quarter. There are now remaining 6.8 million shares that are available to be purchased under the 2006 buyback program. ", "Earlier this year the board provided additional flexibility by authorizing a new buyback program of 45 million shares. Since 1996, the corporation has returned 6.8 billion to share holders through dividend payments and share buybacks, which includes approximately $915 million returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2007. ", "The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter 2007 are 361.5 million shares. That's a 15.8 million share decrease compared to the first quarter of 2006 and a 2.7 million share decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. The quarter only benefited modestly from the first quarter buyback of 13.2 million shares since the bulk of the repurchases occurred near the end of the quarter. ", "We have resumed borrowing in the commercial paper markets to fund our seasonal cash requirements and ended the first quarter in a net debt position of approximately $178 million. This compares to a net cash position of $351 million at year end 2006. And as of march 31st on a gross basis, our debt position is $607 million, which is offset by about $430 million in cash, primarily in foreign holdings. We expect to return to a net surplus cash position by the end of the year. ", "Interest expense was $1.2 million for the first quarter. Last year we were essentially debt free in the first quarter and had net interest income of $2.5 million. Interest expense for the second quarter will increase since it will reflect commercial paper borrowings for the full quarter. For 2007, we now expect a full year interest expense to range from $24\u201326 million. This is higher than our previous estimate due to the timing of funding cost related to the accelerated share repurchases as well as additional interest expense resulting from the implementation of FIN 48. ", "Now FIN 48, or FASB interpretation number 48, which is accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, became effective for the company on January 1st, 2007. GAAP based financial statements must account for taxes including an analysis of all tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting treatment of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken at any income tax returns. FIN 48 also clarifies the rules regarding accruing interest on certain tax positions. We will continue to accrue interest within the interest expense category. ", "Last year, as Terry mentioned, we transformed Sweets from real construction groups properly building products database from a primarily print catalogue to a bundle print and online service. The associated accounting change benefited year-over-year comparisons for information and media. For the first quarter 2007 the results reflect $6.5 million of revenue and $5.8 million of operating profit resulting from the sweets transformation. ", "Let's have a look at our corporate expenses. Corporate expenses decreased $5.6 million or 13.8% in the first quarter compared to a year ago but there were several one time factors that influenced this decline. Last year's first quarter corporate expenses included a $14.8 million charge relating to the elimination of the restoration stock option program. The year-over-year comparisons are also impacted by a $4.6 million gain on the sale of an office and printing facility that also occurred in the first quarter of 2006. ", "Categories with incorporate expense that increased are the following: expenses associated with the new business process management program that was implemented this year designed to strengthen our core processes and ensure alignment with customer needs while improving operational efficiency; increase in vacant space form downsizing; business rationalization initiatives that were implemented in 2006; and hiring setup compensation. ", "The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 37.7%. The 50 basis point increase from the prior year is driven the change to the accounting for uncertain tax positions FIN 48, the gain in connection with the sale of the company's mutual fund data business, and a state tax audit settlement. Based on these factors, the operating effective tax rate for the balance of the year is projected to be 37.5%. ", "Now let's take a look at capital expenditures which include prepublication investments and purchases of property and equipment. In the first quarter our prepublication investments were $57 million compared to about $61 million for the same period last year. For 2007 our prepublication investments will now be about $310 million. We anticipate a reduction in spending from our original projection of approximately $330 million through efficiencies, technology, global sourcing, and simply firming up our forecast for the year. ", "Purchases of property and equipment were $23 million in the first quarter compared to $12 million in the same period last year. This increase is due to the construction of our new data center which has now begun along with technology investments we are making to digitize our products and services. We continue to project $250 million for 2007. ", "Now for non-cash items: Amortization for prepublication cost was $28 million in the first quarter compared to about $23 million for the same period last year. We ramped up our publishing schedule last year in anticipation of the strong new state adoptions in 2007, 2008, and 2009. We continue to expect $260 million in amortization of prepublication costs for 2007. ", "Depreciation was $29 million in the first quarter compared to about $28 million for the same period last year. We still expect it to be $130 million in 2007 reflecting the higher level of capital expenditures of 2007 and a fuller year of depreciation of capital expenditures made in 2006. ", "Finally amortization of intangibles was about $12 million in the first quarter which is about the same amount as compared to last year. For 2007 we continue to expect $50 million. Thank you and now back to Harry. ", "Harold McGraw", "OK. Thanks Bob and let me go to you Don. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. Please press \"star one\" to indicate that you wish to enter the queue and ask a question. To cancel or withdraw your question simply press \"star two\". If you've been listening through a speaker phone but would now like to ask a question, we ask that you lift your handset prior to pressing \"star one\" and remain on the handset until your question has been answered. That would ensure good sound quality for all of us. ", "We\u2019re now ready to take the first question. ", "Operator", "Thank you. This question comes from Peter Appert of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. ", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning. Terry, you cited the second quarter starting with a good pipeline at S&PND in terms of new issue volume. Could you give us any additional color on that in terms of category strength or geographic strength you\u2019re seeing? ", " Harold McGraw ", "Yeah, again it\u2019s very appealing Peter because it\u2019s across the board. We talked about the corporate governance side and it\u2019s strong here mainly because of the M&A activity but also in Europe and Japan as well so that part is doing well. The structured finance market is doing exceptionally well. The only piece within that that\u2019s off is the US residential mortgage bank market. The European residential mortgage bank market is actually doing pretty well. And that market in the United States, we predicted it to be off 10-15% and it was off 10.8% but everywhere else, the commercial mortgage bank market continues to be very very strong. It\u2019s been strong since early 2005 and continues. You\u2019re seeing it in the debt obligation market and you\u2019re seeing it in the non-traditional areas as well especially in terms of the bank loan ratings areas. So it is again a very very strong pipeline and we\u2019re very pleased with the start. ", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "OK great. Thanks Terry and then one unrelated question. I was impressed you were able to post a first quarter decline in the seasonal education business. Might we read into that you\u2019re spending less on marketing and promotion than you otherwise would have anticipated this year or is it all a function of the upside coming from the college business. ", " Harold McGraw ", "Well, you\u2019ve got both. There\u2019s a timing issue certainly according to those expenses but also as you rightly say the higher education market was very strong. As you may recall Peter, we had a little softness in the fourth quarter last year in terms of unit sales and we think that there were some timing issues associated with that. We were really glad to see the pick up especially in early January. ", "We were talking about that echo effect and because we thought that it should have been a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter last year and there really was a timing issue into January, but it\u2019s strong and the professional market is also doing very well, and particularly I\u2019m very pleased with the innovation part but as you correctly say this is, 2007 is a very important year for the education market. 2008, 2009, and 2010 are too but this is the first year of a multi-year period and with the adoption schedule so strong we really want to really be able to do a good job here. ", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "And then one thing Terry, you noticed the ownership changes for some of the competitors in the market. Do you see some indication in the market that maybe some of these other players are less aggressive from a marketing and promotion spending as a function of these changes? ", " Harold McGraw ", "I that that probably all\u2026and I wouldn\u2019t want to speak for some of them but they\u2019re probably all different reasons, but one of the things that we\u2019ve talked about and when we\u2019re talking about major market transformation in the educational instructional material business, you need to see some turmoil. You need to see some people deciding not that they want to make investments and play and others that want to get in. And so I think that they are all very good signals that the market transformation that we\u2019ve been talking about is well under way. ", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "OK, Thanks Terry. ", " Harold McGraw ", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Lisa Monaco from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. ", " Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley ", "Good morning. Terry, could you just comment a little bit, this is a bit of a follow up to Peter\u2019s question, just on the debt issuance in the first quarter. How much of that was related to potential deals being pulled into the future March period? And then if you could just talk to the strength, the CDO market and what\u2019s driving that and if you could just quantify what percent of the CDOs that you rate are related, are tied to RMBS in the sub prime market and given the slow down in RMBS how is the growth in CDO issue going to be resolved? Thanks.. ", " Harold McGraw ", "OK, thanks Lisa. Bob, did you get that last point? Between us we\u2019ll get these. A lot of questions here. ", "There always is timing issues, Lisa. The pipeline has been strong in \u201905, \u201906 and again the phones worked very hard to get it all completed but there are timing issues on that one. But again it\u2019s just very very strong at this point. There is just no let up on that. ", "The CDOs are very attractive because it is the instrument of choice for so many financial institutions because of all of the variability that CDOs have in terms of being able to break up into various attributes and various risk rewards capabilities and the like, and it just gives portfolio managers more flexibility to do more things in terms of the constructions of those portfolios so the CDO strength that we\u2019re seeing now is a continuation of the attractiveness of those investments. ", "With residential mortgage bank, the US market was down 10.8% and again the sub-prime market was down 24.4% on that part. Now, you know the thing on the sub-prime, it has gotten, in my opinion an awful lot of spotlight in the general press and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as warranted or as deserved. I don\u2019t want to understate it but you know when you're talking about an economy that\u2019s in its sixth year of expansion, you know the Fed reserve worked hard to bring down the growth rate with the 17 rate hikes from last year. ", "The housing sector has been most affected and therefore with the rise in those rates we have seen some faults on the sub prime (inaudible. Yes, there were some lenders that were way too aggressive and that is why over a year ago, S&P changed some of the lost coverage criteria for those lenders and put those into effect such that it reflected the fact that some of these lenders were too aggressive. ", "Of the outstanding mortgage loan volume sub-prime is about 13% of that market and yes, I think the housing market slump has bottomed (inaudible) that one in terms of sales and new start, but we will see throughout the year certain defaults on some of the sub-prime loans, but it won\u2019t have a material impact in our opinion, on our results. ", "So we just think that these are in the housing sector, these excesses\u2026we all know get into the market and we see that those that are least able to afford certain things, you know you\u2019re going to see some defaults on that. Bob, you want to add anything? ", "Robert J. Bahash", "Yeah, Lisa the growth in the CDO area continues in our case to be driven by some of the new structures, the hybrids, the opportunities within the cash flow and synthetic sectors and clearly sub-prime issuance is part of some of the CDO packages but as Terry pointed out it\u2019s a small piece relative to the total issuance volume. ", " Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley ", "OK. And then just quickly on El-Hi? Terry could you just give us some adding total evidence why you feel comfortable with the 10-15% growth in the new adoption markets you cited early indications from some of the large states. What specifically are those early indicators? Thanks. ", " Harold McGraw ", "Well, again, I gave you some of the heads-up in some of the areas: New York, Washington DC, Milwaukee, and so forth. But again, it's a very full calendar. The state new-adoption market will be up in the 10%-15% range. And you've got some major disciplines in major states. You've got K-12 science in California; K-12 health and world languages in Florida; K-8 math in Georgia; in Indiana, you've got grades 1-8 reading and literature; in Texas, grades 6-12 math; and Tennessee is doing a K-5 reading. So you've got a broad representation in that market, and that coupled with a growing open-territories market, is pretty attractive. ", "Now, it's too early to start making calls on capture rates. We'll probably get into that toward the end of May and into June. But the early indications of some of these sales campaigns are telling us that the product is right, and it's getting very strong receptivity. So we're encouraged. But that's the right word, Lisa: encouraged. And again, it's an important year for us, and we really want to post some very good results. ", " Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley ", "Great, thank you. ", " Operator ", "The next question is from Michael Meltz with Bear Stearns. You may ask your question. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns ", "Great, thank you. I think I have three questions on S&P. Terry, I think there was a slide where you talked about the outlook, specifically for the CDO areas, and you mentioned growth should decelerate, or might decelerate. Can you just talk a little bit though\u2026are you still expecting revenue growth from CDO business for the rest of the year? I know it's a general question, but I think it's important. ", "And then Bob, on the margin side, can you just talk a little bit about S&P in the accruals. Did you normalize things this quarter? Is there anything we should be aware of on the margin side? ", "And then, last question: Can you just say the 21% revenue growth in the quarter was (inaudible)? If we examine ratings versus non-ratings, which grew faster? Thank you. ", " Harold McGraw ", "Ok, Michael. On the collateralized debt obligation market, again, this has been a very strong market, and multi-year, and it has been growing as the acceptance of CDOs and the availability of CDO usage, has taken hold of the marketplace. The CDO market was up 154% in Q1, and that's coming off a pretty good base. That is pretty stunning growth. I just don't think that we can expect 154% growth in each quarter going forward. ", "So we are just saying that we think there's a slower growth rate in the subsequent quarters, but it is going to grow, on that one, and we see nothing to hold that back. Bob? ", " Robert Bahash ", "Yeah, just to expand upon that point. Our second quarter estimate at this point in time, based on external data, calls for significant growth in the US in the CDO area, in terms of par value are up over 60% and that's in the US. In Europe we're forecasting close to 23% growth in the CDO marketplace in the second quarter. So those are very strong. ", "The question with regard to margins and accruals, wwe're very fine there. What you're seeing is what you're getting. There's a very strong quarter, the margin improvement clearly driven by the higher revenue elements, as well as the containment of costs. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns ", "OK, and on that growth rate, ratings versus non-ratings? ", " Robert Bahash ", "As you know, we do not break those components out. But as Terry pointed out earlier, we saw strong growth across the board in our ratings area: the traditional area, the non-traditional ratings data and information index services. As you know, we don't break it out, but clearly we had very strong performance across the board. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns ", "OK Bob, on your point on the forward look, do you have a feel, as we stand here right now on the second half? Do you guys accumulate a forecast for that? ", " Robert Bahash ", "Well, as we're looking at the full year, I have full-year data in front of me now \u2013 again, based on external information, CDO growth in the US forecasts to be about 30% and in Europe, about 28%, so clearly very positive through the balance of the year. As Terry pointed out, we expect to grow financial services double-digit, top and bottom line, for the balance of the year. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns ", "Sorry, one last clarification. Maybe it's a seasonality issue, but if you're saying +125 in the first quarter and +60 in the second, or +30 for the year, wouldn't that imply down in the second half? ", " Robert Bahash ", "Well, yeah. I think the key to focus on here is that this is a very broad portfolio, and you're focusing on one particular element within the portfolio. We see significant growth in other sectors. Again, with data and information that has been growing very strong we feel very, very comfortable about our forecast for the full year. ", "As we've pointed out earlier and as you well know, we have forecast a decline in the marketplace in 2007, and we continue to hold to that. So that is within that structured area. We do expect a decline, we expect a decline in the second half of the year. No question about it. Nevertheless, we feel very comfortable about our forecast for the balance of the year. ", " Harold McGraw ", "And I would also say, Michael, that when you're talking about year-over-year, the decline of 10%-15% that we're predicting for the US residential market, it's still a sizable market. And the year-over-year comparisons obviously just get a little bit difficult. ", " Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns ", "OK, thank you for your time. ", " Operator ", "The next question is from Karl Choi from Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. ", " Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch ", "Hi, good morning. A quick question. I wonder if I heard it correctly, Terry, you're now expecting (inaudible) high industry growth to be 5-7% for the year, which I think is a little bit higher than 4-6% previously. I'm wondering what drove that to change? I have a follow up. ", " Harold McGraw ", "OK. Again, as we go we'll give you our best thinking on that one. We see the market growing at 5-7%, and we see ourselves outperforming the market. ", " Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch ", "Similar question for college, given the strong start in January or in the first quarter overall, and the seasonality of the business, does a 4% growth for the industry seem a little bit conservative, given the fact that it seems like is was double digit in the first quarter? ", " Harold McGraw ", "Yeah, again, in terms of some of the timing-related issues, I go back to the question about the fourth quarter. College sales, higher-education sales, were just a little bit lower than what we thought they were going to come in at. And we were trying to put that into context, on that one. And the echo effect that we talked about happened in January rather than in December. ", "So I think the first quarter numbers benefited from some of the follow-through coming out of December. But again, maybe you're right, maybe it is conservative. But I think that right now, the best information we have on the market is 4%. And given what we're seeing at this point, and how well the products are doing, we think we're going to beat that. ", " Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch ", "And Bob, I don't know if you have this, but do you have the deferred revenues at the end of the year quarter? And if you have the growth rate year over year, that would be great, as well. ", " Robert Bahash ", "OK, let me just look for that. I do have it. I'll have it in just a moment. ", " Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch ", "And lastly, Terry, you have the 20% operating margin goal for education. Is there any update on what progress you can make on improving the margins on the whole year, given the good start that you had in the first quarter? ", " Harold McGraw ", "Well, again, you know all the components we're looking at, in terms of that goal. And there was the global transformation project, and there was the resource management project, and the market itself, and so on. I think that's our goal, and this is an important year. So let's see how this year starts to unfold, and then we can tighten that up for you. But that's the goal. ", " Robert Bahash ", "Karl, with regard to the unearned/deferred revenue you asked me about, at the end of the quarter it's about $978 million. ", "I should just point out that in the base year last year would have included an element form the divested funds business so the growth rate would be higher because of course we don't have that in this year. So this is almost 13% with funds in the base year so it's something higher than that, so nice performance here. ", " Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Drew Crum from Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question. ", " Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Harry I was wondering if you could share with us if there was any update on the regulatory front for the credit rating business. ", "Harold McGraw", "Yeah and I'll make sure that I've got these dates right. At this point we've gone back and forth with the FCC. They're in the final stages now of developing their final positions. I believe those have to be completed by May 23rd. On that one I'll get that date exactly for you but I think they need to be completed by May 23rd for implementation in June on that part. ", "From our standpoint, it has been a fairly good outcome. We have gotten the things that we want. There was some discussion on a couple of issues going on but the FCC is on schedule and so far we're very comfortable with the way it's working. ", "Let me see if I've got June 26th. June 26th and I think May 23rd was the deadline for them to complete their work but they have to be implemented by June 26th on that one and we don't see any, and again all along we've been working very comfortably with them, we don't see anything that materially would effect us. ", " Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "OK, question for you on the L-high business. You talked about last quarter cutting some less than profitable testing contracts and based on the due diligence we've done you guys appear to be maintaining share and picking up some nice contracts along the way. I was wondering if you could comment directionally the profitability for this business. You talked about margin erosion the last several consecutive quarters. At what point do you reverse that trend and get the margin going in the right direction? ", "Harold McGraw", "OK. We are sitting on some very big contracts that will be coming due in the second quarter. And we're waiting for the outcome of some of those and we're very hopeful on that one. ", "Let me put it into the broader context again. Again you have two types of tests. You have the sum of the test, the high stakes test and you've got the formative test which is the low stakes test. The growth in this market is in the formative side. In the past our strength has always been on the very large high stakes tests. The information management systems designed to create those tests are different than the ones to do the formative. ", "The formative low stakes tests for teachers, for principals, administrators, whatever, you need to have and you have to have customization to what they're trying to measure. And those two require different information management systems, and as you were saying, that's where the investment is going, in creating the capabilities such that we can compete very quickly in those markets. Now the brand that we're using on the formative side is Acuity and Acuity is up again and some big contracts and we should probably hear fairly soon on a number of them. So that would be a second quarter issue. But again the investment, and a lot of it is P&L investment, is still ongoing in terms of building the kinds of systems to do that. ", " Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "OK thanks for the color, Terry. And Bob, one question for you, is there any updated guidance for free cash flow for the year? ", "Robert J. Bahash", "No, we haven't made any adjustments. We're in the range of $750\u2013775 million. We're holding to that in this point in time. The sharing purchase activity was simply a timing issue in terms of the acceleration earlier in the year versus what we probably would have done over the balance of the year, but no impact over the $750\u2013775 million. ", " Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "OK. Thanks guys. ", "Harold McGraw", "Thanks Drew. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Fred Searby of JP Morgan. You may ask your question. ", "Frederick Searby - JP Morgan", "Hey thanks guys. Great quarter. Question for you Terry. Just to drill down a little bit on the margin expansion you saw at Standard & Poor\u2019s, clearly that was extremely positive. How much is fixed cost solution? Bob you mentioned that some of it was fixed cost solution and some of it was changes. Are we seeing as you ramp up in some of these non-ratings businesses, particularly Catholic Union as actually having a meaningful impact on margins as you kind of gain scale and secondly what should be the progress there throughout the year? It sounds like you're expecting some ongoing strength in margins at Standard & Poor\u2019s. Thank you. ", "Harold McGraw", "Yeah thanks Fred. Let me take the first whack and then follow up Bob. ", "You're going to get margin expansion at financial services in 2007. You're not going to get a lot of contribution more than from investments like Capital IQ. Capital IQ, we are really driving hard in terms of customer penetration and market acceptance. And therefore they're in a full investment mode. We are very excited about the prospects for Captial IQ and the progress they're making. And again in terms of the overarching strength the margin expansion is coming from a higher level of efficiency and the robust growth. We expect for 2007, quite frankly in terms of our own plans going forward, it's to continue to see margin expansion on S&P. ", "So I think the guidance I would give you is that we're definitely going to do better than 2006 and let's see how the year starts to unfold where we are. But $477 million for the first quarter includes that $17.3 million gain on that mutual fund gain but still it's showing good growth and we expect as Bob said to show double digit top to bottom and margin expansion in the remainder of the year. Bob do you want to add anything? ", "Robert J. Bahash", "Yeah. Fred, the margin improvements came really across the board with regard to our various products and services whether it's in ratings, data information portfolio services, and performance evaluation side. So we're seeing very very good performance across the board with very prudent expense management. As Terry pointed out, we're allocating resources, we're allocating our expenditures for those particular growth areas where we have an opportunity to significantly expand platforms and we're going to continue to do that and at the same time looking prudently at managing cost in other areas. So we have very solid performance on the revenue side and very prudent management on the cost side. ", "Harold McGraw", "One of the areas, Fred, that we institutionalized throughout the corporation last year, and it was a consolidated business process management function, there's a business process operation in each of the segments and corporate. And they're all coordinated but they all have a number of projects that they're working on therefore when we start talking about efficiency and process improvement we expect to see more and more based on those kinds of initiatives. ", "Frederick Searby - JP Morgan", "Just this one follow-up: You have made what looks like a very (inaudible) call on buying crystal and some of these other agencies around the world and I wondered how margins are impacting the overall business at some of these smaller but albeit fairly exciting rating agencies around the world. How we should think about that as they continue to grow and at some point start growing faster of course than your domestic business? ", "Harold McGraw", "Again Fred, the international growth rates are higher and that's why you're seeing more and more participation in the United States. Building that global network is extremely important. ", "Crystal is a much larger operation that has been added for a while. We have had a relationship with them since 1996 and it is very strong and doing extremely well. And that's also because of the Indian market that it is doing so much better. ", "When we start talking about some of the smaller and as you got to get the revenue base up to be able to get the same level of participation and therefore they're in varying degrees again of development and they would have different margin levels. But they will have comparable margins, as all will have comparable margins to the US as they gain size and critical mass. But again the growth outside the United States is much faster. ", "Frederick Searby - JP Morgan", "Alright thanks. ", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from the line of Brandon Dobell of Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. ", "Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. I'm going to repeat the debt horse one more time. If I could frame the CDO growth expectations question a different way if Q1 was up 150% and Q2 expectations are up 60% and all of Q1 came in all above of what we were expecting it to, the two part question would be wouldn't that necessitate either a change to the year estimate if it started out so strong, wouldn't that 30% now have to be higher? ", "Or if in '06 the first half of the year was roughly 40% of the volume, with your projection for Q1 and Q2, it seems like the math would have to work out that the back half of the year would have to be roughly flat or down a little bit for that 30% number to be the right number. Just trying to put all of those things together to understand how it is. If the forecast is too low and quite materially too low if we see continued strength or if the implication is that 30% is the right number there should be an offset to the strength that we saw to the first quarter out of the box? Thanks. ", "Harold McGraw", "Bob's got some specific numbers for you Brandon. But remember you have 154% now as a Q1 over Q1 growth rate and the other numbers that Bob was giving you were the same. And the market strong and will be strong and we're going to be participating right along with it. Bob you want to get the specific number on that? ", "Robert J. Bahash", "Yeah when you go through and do that math and 30% which I indicated was the full year, the second half of the year would work out to be roughly flat as compared to the second half of the previous year. ", "Again as I point out, imbedded within that forecast were elements of the RMBS issuance and such that we had forecast to be down on the year to year basis by roughly 15% which we expected to see pretty much across the board and if not possibly accelerating in the second half of the year. So that clearly is an influencing factor but again that's one part of the market. ", "The CMBS area is growing significantly. We expect corporates to do very well, the nontraditional markets bank loan ratings and such to do very well. And we continue to be very very bullish about our non-ratings products and services being data information, portfolio services, etc. ", "As well as high yield by the way. High yield is expected to do very well through the balance of the year. So again this is a portfolio look and as we looked at the portfolio, we looked at issuance, we looked at future revenue streams and such, that's how we came up with our balance of the year double digit top and bottom line. ", "Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", "OK. I appreciate the clarification. That's great help. And you guys have a more diverse portfolio than I think people realize sometimes. In the education space, as you look forward over the '07, '08, '09 timeframe you gave some color about what percentage the adoption market you expect to compete in this year. Should we anticipate that the '08 \u2013 '09 timeframe that you guys also go after that much of the adoption market or is it materially different in those two years that your portfolio fits better this year than it might in '09 let's say? ", "Harold McGraw", "No that's certainly the game plan, Brandon. When you start talking about '08 and we're into '08 product now and you know '08 and '09 you still got very big in a state and very big disciplines. This year you've got California K-12 science. In '08 you've got California K-12 math. And then in '09 you're going to have California K-12 reading and literature so those are big. Florida not only do you have the Help the World Languages for this year, in a way you've got K-12 reading and reading intervention which will be big and in '09 you're going to have 6-12 literature in Florida and so forth. ", "So the plan with this kind of major adoptions and especially with the reading, math, and the science, you can count that we are going to be looking to participate in all of those. ", "Brandon Dobell - Credit Suisse", "OK, great, thank a lot. ", "Harold McGraw", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call.

And good morning, and thanks for everyone joining us this morning for the McGraw-Hill Company second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. I'm Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at the McGraw-Hill Companies. With me today are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President, and CEO; Robert Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Vicky Tillman, Executive Vice President at Standard & Poor's.

", "Today's update will last approximately an hour. After our presentation, we will open the meetings to questions and answers. It's now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President, and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Okay. Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our view of the McGraw-Hill Company second quarter results. As Don mentioned, joining me today on today's conference call are Bob Bahash, who's Executive Vice President and CFO; also, Vicky Tillman is Executive Vice President of Standard & Poor's. She's the head of the credit market services and our chief rating officer. ", "I'll begin by reviewing our results for the second quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year. Then I've asked Vicky Tillman to provide some context for some of the recent rating decisions at Standard & Poor's credit market services, and then Bob will review our financial performance and then, of course, we're pleased to take any questions or comments that you have about the McGraw-Hill Companies. ", "Earlier this morning, we announced our second quarter results and for this period, we reported earnings per share increased 31.7%, which is $0.79. Revenue grew by 12.5% to $1.7 billion, and the operating margin improved in all three segments. In looking ahead, we see reasonably healthy economic conditions. In fact, overall economic conditions are quite good, save the housing recession, which is costing the United States about 1 percentage point of growth. Inflation remains moderate at 2.2%, which is at the top end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s comfort zone. So we expect more watchful waiting by the fed before any interest rate adjustments. ", "Growth in the U.S. gross domestic product picked up in the second quarter. David Wyss, the Chief Economist at Standard & Poor's, now expects GDP growth up 2.5% for the second half of the year and 2.1% for the full year and improving into 2008. Again, David estimates that the housing recession has clipped about 1 percentage point of growth from the GDP for the U.S. this year and certainly, as we look at the housing recession, we're looking at new starts will probably bottom out by sometime by the end of the year. ", "He doesn't expect housing prices to bottom out until probably the spring of '08, and losses and foreclosures may not hit their peak until late 2008, but we're in the later innings of the housing recession. Nonresidential construction continues to do well. State budgets are generally in pretty good shape, and, of course, that's very good for the education marketplace. ", "With that as background, let's now review our operating results and let's begin with McGraw-Hill Education. In the second quarter, there was more evidence that the good year we expected in the Elementary/High School Market is certainly taking shape. ", "In the second quarter, revenue increased 5.8%, operating profit grew by 18.6%, and the operating margin improved to 12.4%. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group was up 3.3%, revenue for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional and International Group was up 10.3%. This is a great time to be in the educational publishing with a well-established team and a well-developed growth strategy in place. We're building for a very promising future and certainly the 2007, '08, '09 and 2010 marketplace looks quite good. ", "Contrast with that with an industry in flux where we're seeing changes in ownership, changes in organization and consolidation that in effect reduces the number of major competitors from four to three in the Elementary/High School Market, all the changes and uncertainty will take some time to sort out. In the meantime, we expect to gain share this year, especially in the Elementary/High School Market and as well in the U.S. College and the University markets. ", "We strengthened our School Education Group last fall by creating a single, well-coordinated K-12 team under the direction of our most experienced and successful managers. As a result, we are improving our performance in both the K-5 marketplace as well as the 6 through 12 market. ", "A broad and deep product lineup has always been important to us, because one size obviously definitely does not fit all in a large and diverse market. With its spectrum of products, we are performing well in both academic and nonacademic subjects. ", "In nonacademic subjects, we are on our way to achieving high market shares in small but profitable categories, such as: health, business education, technical and vocational education, as well as family and consumer science. A key factor in our performance will be the capture rates that we achieve in this year's rapidly-growing state new adoption market. We expect the state new adoption market to come in between $750 million and $800 million, a 10% to 15% increase over last year. ", "We're anticipating in virtually the entire market this year versus about 80% in 2006. Much of the 2007 business remains to be decided, but based on current trend, we certainly expect to take more than 30% of the available dollars in the total state new adoption market. ", "Math and science offer the biggest opportunities this year for state new adoption sales and we're off to a very good start. Revenue for the school education group in the second quarter was driven by grade 6 through 12 math orders from Texas, K through 12 science orders from California, and K-8 science from South Carolina. ", "We're optimistic about the performance of Treasures, that is our K through 5 balanced basal reading program which is competing well in Indiana, Tennessee and Oregon. Spotlight on Music is positioned to lead the state new adoption market in its subject. We are picking up new business in the second year of the California K through 8 social studies adoption. The outlook is also promising in the grades 6 through 12 literature and reading market in Indiana, Oregon, Tennessee, and West Virginia. ", "In the open territory, we have won some major adoptions in large urban markets, but most small and medium-sized districts don't order until the third quarter, and we expect the open territory market to grow about 4% this year. We will get help in achieving our open territory goals with the new addition of Everyday Mathematics, our reform-based program. The new addition is generating new business in Philadelphia, New York City, and Seattle and should be a leader in the K-5 New Mexico adoption. ", "The supplemental market has been soft this year, but this tends to be a second half business, so we'll have to wait and see how this works out. The market is looking for targeted skills-based intervention programs and we have created a strong lineup to meet the need at both the elementary level and the 6 through 12 level as well. In testing, we experienced softness in both custom and shelf products in the second quarter, but we're getting wonderful traction with Acuity, and Acuity is our new formal testing product as more look for research-based formative solutions. ", "Acuity is a suite of diagnostic and predictive benchmark assessments and it's designed to indicate student learning needs and to track their progress towards mastery of state standards in english, language arts and math. Last week Acuity won the largest formative contract yet award in the United States, a five-year, $80 million arrangement with New York City. Acuity has also been selected by Indianapolis, the biggest district in Indiana, and Mesa, the largest district in Arizona. Acuity's close correlation with state standards, its strong research base, and our reputation for quality are creating a competitive advantage for this product in the testing market. And that's why Acuity algebra was selected by the Rand Corporation as the standard measure of student progress for a five-year study that's being funded by the U.S. Department of Education. ", "We're off to a good start in the U.S. College and University market. The big challenge, of course, occurs in the third quarter. Our three major imprints are performing well and we're gaining traction in digital products, which produce incremental revenue. Homework management products give students access to an interactive online textbook that allows them quick access to relevant content as they work on problems and practice quizzes. Also proving popular with students are our new iPod and MP3-compatible features in our media-enhanced text and we're very pleased with the introduction of these as IPod icons are populating all of our higher education text. ", "In the second quarter, we also benefited from the publication of a McGraw-Hill classic, the 10th edition of the Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, a 20-volume work that we issue every five years and of course we also provide this in an on-line version as well. The encyclopedia is selling well here and also very well abroad. Our best sellers in the professional markets were Harrison's Manual of Medicine. It's in its 16th edition. ", "The Millionaire Maker's Guide to Creating a Cash Machine for Life. Nursing Spectrums Drug Handbook for a 2008 imprint and the current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2007 in its 46th addition. Therefore, summing up for the McGraw-Hill Education, a solid year, a very solid year is taking shape in education and we're very pleased with that. We expect the el-hi market to grow 5% to 7%, we expect the U.S. College and University market to grow about 4%, we expect to outperform both markets and we anticipate margin expansion in this segment for the full year. ", "Okay, with that, let's now turn to the financial services segment. The second quarter results underscore what by now is a familiar story. A diversified and resilient portfolio again produced substantial increases in global financial markets. In the second quarter, revenue increased 21.2%. Operating profit grew by 27.9%, and the operating margin expanded to 48.9%. There were many contributors to our success in the second quarter. First, there's Standard & Poor's unique blend of fixed income and equity services which reduce our dependency on any single asset class. ", "Second is financial service's strong and growing position in international markets, a 10-year compound annual growth rate of 18.9% by financial services in international markets through 2006 underscores that point. Third is our growing array of new services and both fixed income and equity markets. And fourth is the durability of powerful growth trends in our market, the securitization issue, the globalization, privatization, and of course the continued disintermediation movement away from the banks into the capital markets. All of these factors contributed to our performance this year. ", "In the second quarter, the obsession with subprime issues obscured some very, very positive trends in the ratings market. International markets grew at a double-digit rate and contributed 38.9% of ratings revenue in the second quarter, up from 36.6% for the same period a year ago. ", "The U.S. corporate market set a new record for issuance for the second quarter in a row, as both U.S. investment grade, which was up 33% and high-yield, which was up 42.6%, grew substantially. Public finance coming off a slow second quarter last year grew solidly because of new money issuance, but also because of refundings. Structured finance was strong globally, despite a 12.4% decline in the dollar volume issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities in the United States. ", "There was strength in the European residential mortgage-backed securities market, where subprime is not the factor it is here. In fact, we saw solid performance in all asset classes in Europe. The commercial mortgage-backed securities market grow solidly here, but also very much so abroad. In the United States, the collateralized debt obligation market met our expectations. During the conference call on the first quarter earnings, we said that new issuance dollar volume would grow by about 60% in the second quarter and it grew 58%. We saw modest gains in the asset-backed securities market. ", "And another example of our diversity, ratings and services not directly tied to public new issuance also grew at a double-digit rate in the second quarter. These offerings, which we refer to as our nontraditional ratings, accounted for 22.6% of ratings revenue in the second quarter compared to 24.1% for the same period last year. Bank loan ratings were the key driver here. ", "Standard & Poor's is also a leading provider of data and information, analysis, and other service for the equity market, including our expanding lineup of indices. Our client base at Capital IQ continues to grow and we're very pleased with that. We're now at approximately 2,000 customers. That's a 29% increase over the prior year. More new clients and new services that increase penetration at the ones we already serve should keep this business growing very nicely. ", "We're confident that we have strength in our position in this market with a recent acquisition of ClariFi, which is off to an excellent start as the newest addition to the S&P family. In the data and information market, we're seeing good growth from S&P Compustat, RatingsDirect, and RatingsXpress. Assets under management based on S&P indices continue to increase. It was up 20.9% at the end of June to $178.6 billion. ", "In June, trading began on nine new exchange-traded funds based on S&P indices. 30 have been launched so far this year, bringing the total to 127, the total number of exchange-traded funds based on S&P indices. The S&P Citigroup indices formed the backbone of the new fast-growing opportunities to create customized indices and benchmarks. We're successful licensing the recently acquired commodity indices from Goldman Sachs. Recent licensees for the S&P GFCI indices include: Morgan Stanley, Barclays Bank, Deutsche Bank, the National Bank of Canada, UBS, Wachovia, and Cargill. The pipeline is growing. ", "And speaking of pipelines, let's spend some time now on the outlook for the second half. As we've pointed out, we expect low double-digit growth at financial services in the second half, probably tougher comparisons will make the fourth quarter a little bit more challenging. Corporate issuance is off to a strong start in 2007 and there is a large new issue calendar, an attractive financial environment, merger and acquisition activity, and balance sheet restructuring is going to help to continue to drive this market. As the chart shows, the fourth quarter last year was the biggest in 2006 for dollar volume issuance in the U.S. corporate market. ", "In Europe, the corporate sector is off to a solid start and the current pipeline of business is strong and it's across all sectors. Dollar volume issuance in the U.S. public finance started the year on an upswing, but even though this may be a record year for issuance, we expect somewhat slower growth for the balance of 2007. Similar volume issuance in the U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities market is off 11.6% in the first half of this year, and we anticipate a further decline in the second half. ", "We now estimate that dollar volume issuance of U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities will decline by 15% to 20% this year. Our prior guidance here was 10% to 15% and we think maybe just a little bit more, up to about 20% is right. Activity is being driven primarily by Alt-A and net interest margin security deals and the refinancing of adjustable rate mortgages. Many potential deals are on hold as issuers reprice to the new criteria and gauge the market's appetite for residential mortgage-backed securities. ", "The U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities market is up 36.8% in the first half, and of course that's driven by low interest rates and strong commercial real estate fundamentals, but the pipeline for commercial mortgage-backed securities is robust. Dollar volume issuance in the U.S. asset-backed securities market is up 22.5% for the first half, and the pipeline looks very solid. The U.S. collateralized debt obligation market, CDO market, soared last year and is off to a fast start in 2007. ", "We expect more growth in the collateralized debt obligation market in the second half, but at rates well below the blistering pace established in the third and the fourth quarters last year. Collateralized loan obligations, CLO, net market cash, hybrids, and synthetics continue to benefit from investor demand, ample liquidity in the market, and broader acceptance as structures such as the collateralized debt obligations of commercial real estate. In Europe, the pipeline for structured finance products looks very good. ", "We expect a solid second half with all asset classes showing strength with the toughest comparison coming in the fourth quarter. We also expect a solid second half from our data, information, and indices. ", "So let's sum up for financial service, continued strength overseas, more growth in the structured market, solid prospects in the corporate market, growing contributions from data, information, and indices, low double-digit growth in the second half, margin expansion for the year. But no summary of the outlook for financial services at this time would be complete without a reference to a significant recent federal court decision, and some discussion of the decisions S&P has made in the subprime and the CDO markets. ", "On June 5, the federal court reaffirmed the strong legal protection afforded rating agencies in dismissing a complaint against the ratings agencies brought by the attorney general of the state of Connecticut on behalf of the state's resources recovery authority, the federal district judge in Houston, Texas, emphasized the significant public policy reasons for not imposing liability on credit rating agencies for their opinions. ", "And I quote from that decision, \"Imposing such liability would open the flood gates of litigation against credit rating agencies by disappointed investors or creditors, and chill the agencies from vital and vigorous participation in the ratings process and the marketplace where the free flow of information and conflicting views ideally establish reality.\" ", "In recent days, Standard & Poor's have announced some important decisions in the subprime market, and that's why I've asked Vicky Tillman, again Executive Vice President of S&P, and she heads the credit marketing -- the market services and our chief rating officer and asked her today to share some of S&P's perspectives on the rating process and those market conditions. Vicky, will you make your remarks? ", "Vicky Tillman", "Thank you, Terry. There's been a great deal of commentary recently about the deterioration of the subprime market. Not all of it has been particularly insightful or accurate, so we think it's important to share with you Standard & Poor's' perspective on our market conditions and our ratings. In the brief time I have this morning, I would like to make five key points. ", "First, the current situation did not develop overnight. For more than a year, Standard & Poor's have been signalling the market about the deterioration in residential mortgage-backed securities backed by subprime loans and their potential affect on credit worthiness. ", "Second, S&P continues to alert the market to new problems. On June 2, for example, we commented to the market about emerging issues with collateral debt obligation. S&P said that covenant-like juggernaut is raising CLO risks and that we were raising the collateralized loan obligation loss criteria to reflect potential expectations of increased loss exposure on covenant light loans. ", "Third, we do not structure or engineer transactions nor do we arbitrate on which deals can or cannot proceed. Our guidelines and criteria are publicly available. ", "Fourth, criteria is a factor in whether or not Standard & Poor's is selected to do a rating. Tightening criteria may have an adverse impact on our market share, but we will continue to develop and adjust our criteria to reflect how changing conditions impact credit risk. We are driven to improve our ratings process because it is our excellent track record that makes Standard & Poor's a rating agency of choice. ", "Fifth, the performance of Standard & Poor's structured finance ratings have been exceptionally strong over a long period of time. Our regularly-published default studies show the clear relationship between the initial ratings signed by Standard & Poor's and the likelihood of default. ", "Since 1978, the average five-year default rate for investment-grade structured securities is 0.87%. The default rate for speculative-grade securities is 15.42%. We identified heightened credit exposure with so-called affordability products and the layering of multiple risk factors in loan programs over a year ago and adjusted our assumptions going back to April 2006. ", "In any rating decision, we are concerned about the duration and the severity of issues affecting future credit performance. We need sufficient time and data to show how collateral pools are performing. Our recent actions are a continuation of that view and in applying our adjusted assumptions to the delinquency default and loss trends to make decisions on some of the RMBS transactions. ", "Let me quickly sum up our latest actions in July. S&P downgraded 562 classes of rated RMBS transactions that were backed by first lien subprime loans from the fourth quarter of 2005 through the fourth quarter of 2006. It's worth noting that the 6.3 -- $6.3 billion of securities represented only 1.1% of all first lien subprime RMBS deals rated during this period. ", "We also downgraded 418 classes of S&P rated RMBS transactions, which were backed by closed-end second liens. That represented $3.8 billion in volume or 6.1% of this class. As a result of the first lien subprime downgrades, 74 synthetic CDOs were downgrades, 19 classes of cash flow and hybrid CDOs were placed on credit watch negative, 17 classes of cash flow and hybrid CDOs were placed on credit watch negative as a result of the closed end second lien downgrades, and yesterday an additional 33 tranches from eight U.S. cash flow and hybrid CDOs were also placed on credit watch negative. ", "Again, the result of downgrades of the first lien subprime transactions. The downgrades we announced on the first lien subprime collateral did not impact any AAA ratings. ", "Also note that while eight classes of the AAA second lien RMBS deals were downgraded, none of these fell below investment grade. Of course, we will continue to monitor these issues and will take any further rating actions we deem to be appropriate. In fact, the actions we have taken in July are part of Standard & Poor's ongoing process of adjusting its assumptions and ratings to reflect current trends in the housing market, the mortgage finance market, consumer credit, and the overall economy as they move over time. ", "We have provided the market with information on our approach for rating new CDOs containing RMBS securities, which are backed by nonprime collateral, and S&P is currently reviewing RMBS transactions, which are backed by Alt-As and the net interest margin collateral. That will be completed over the next several weeks. Transactions issued after January 2007 have not had adequate seasoning. ", "We are monitoring these transactions under new assumptions and will take such ratings actions as we deem appropriate and as more loss data becomes available. In our view, loans made prior to January '05 are not at the same level of risk as those made since then. ", "I'll wrap up with one final observation. Our role is to provide an independent opinion on credit worthiness based on demonstrable facts. Sometimes that puts us at odds with the ebb and flow of market sentiment. While the market doesn't always agree with our ratings, we take a longer-term view and do what we believe is right for the market. And I would make one further note. ", "Tomorrow, Standard & Poor's structured finance group will be holding a teleconference discussing the details of the downgrades that I have gone over with you today, as well as some future actions and the changes and assumptions that we have made, and I encourage any of you that are interested in this detail to please dial in. The teleconference facts will be made available today. Thank you. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Okay. Thanks very much, Vicky. And now let's take a look at the information and media segment. Growth in information products and some shortfalls in advertising were the hallmarks of this segment's second quarter performance. In the second quarter, revenue grew by 4.7%, operating profit increased by 13.1%, and the operating margin was 5.9%. The segment benefited in the second quarter from the change in accounting for the transformation of Sweet, and I'm going to ask Bob Bahash to cover that in his financial comments. ", "In the second quarter, Sweet's contributed an incremental $6.5 million to revenue and $5.8 million to operating profit. In the business-to-business group, revenue increased 7.9% to $223.1 million. This group includes some of our company's best-known brands: J.D. Power and Associates, Platts, BusinessWeek, and McGraw-Hill construction and Aviation Week. ", "Information products and services were a key to our progress in the B to B group. The incremental revenue from Sweets due to the accounting change was part of the picture. But we also had contributions from Platts News and pricing services for oil, natural gas, and power markets. The price of energy commodity continues to be volatile and is driving demand for our news and pricing services. We also benefited from the new J.D. Power and Associates studies in the financial services and healthcare sector, as well as increased penetration from existing studies. ", "Listening to the voice of the customer is a powerful concept and we continue to build on it. Advertising pages for BusinessWeek's global print addition were off 20% in the second quarter, and that's according to publisher's information bureau figures. BusinessWeek.com though continues to expand. The new company Insight center, utilizing Capital IQ's extensive database of company fundamental data is attracting a global audience. ", "Search traffic has been growing steadily since the launch. Revenue for the broadcasting group declined by 16% to $26.8 million in the second quarter, in obviously a nonelection year. Automotive, a key category, was also off sharply. Political campaigns are starting sooner and lasting longer. So while 2007 is not an election year, we may still have some political advertising in the second half. ", "At the moment, broadcasting's third quarter pacing is off 4%. Summing up for information media, a soft year in advertising, growth in information services, and margin expansion for the full year. ", "That completes our review of the three operating segments. And so summing up then again for the full corporation, we expect to achieve our goal of double-digit earnings growth in 2007, even though the growth rate will probably be slower during the second half of the year as compared to our very strong first half performance. Although we expect low double-digit growth from financial services in the second half, tougher comparisons year-over-year will make the fourth quarter more challenging. ", "Some operating margin compression may occur in our segments in the second half, but we still expect improved operating margins in all three operating segments for the full year. So with that, let me leave that and let me go over to Bob Bahash, and then we'll take your questions. ", "Bob Bahash", "Okay, thank you, Terry. I'll start with an update on our share repurchase program. We began the year intending to buy 15 million shares in 2007. After we purchased 13.2 million shares during the first quarter, the Board of Directors at its April meeting approved an increase of up to an additional 15 million shares, bringing this year's total repurchase authorization to up to 30 million shares for 2007. ", "In the second quarter, we repurchased 6.3 million shares on a trade date basis at a total cost of $431.6 million. That brings the first half repurchases to 19.5 million shares for approximately $1.3 billion. Half a million shares remain available to be repurchased under the 2006 buyback program and 45 million shares remain under the 2007 program. Since 1996, the corporation has returned $7.3 billion to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks, including more than $1.4 billion return to shareholders in the first half of 2007. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2007 is 350.3 million shares, a 15.2 million share decrease compared to the second quarter of 2006, and an 11.2 million share decrease compared to the first quarter of this year, of course due to the impact of share repurchases. ", "We've ramped up our borrowings to fund the additional share repurchases and seasonal cash requirements and ended the second quarter in a net debt position of approximately $636 million, which is up from a net debt position of $178 million at the end of the first quarter. As of June 30, on a gross basis, our debt is $994 million, offset by $358 million in cash, primarily foreign holdings. This debt reflects a diversified mix of short-term borrowings in the commercial paper, extendible commercial note, and money market loan markets. ", "Interest expense is $12 million in the second quarter, a $3.5 million increase compared to last year due to the borrowing. If market and business conditions support the completion of the full 30 million share repurchase program for 2007, we'd be in a net debt position at year end. We'd also expect the full-year interest expense to range between $40 million to $42 million, again if we complete the whole program, up from our previous estimate of $24 million to $26 million due to the primarily the additional 15 million shares of repurchases. ", "As we discussed last quarter and 2006, we transformed Sweets, McGraw-Hill construction's group popular building products database from a primarily print catalog to a bundled print and online service. The associated accounting change benefited year-over-year comparisons for information and media. Second quarter 2007 results reflect $6.5 million of incremental revenue and $5.8 million of incremental operating profit resulting from the Sweets transformation. ", "Let's take a look now at the corporate expense. Corporate expenses increased $7 million or 20% in the second quarter compared to a year ago and it's primarily attributable to several factors. First, expenses associated with the new business process management program that's focused on our core processes and insuring alignment with customer needs while improving operational efficiency. ", "Higher incentive compensation accruals due to better operating performance, our corporate advertising program, which I'm sure many of you have heard, and an increase in vacant space from downsizing and business rationalization initiatives implemented in 2006. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 37.5%. We expect to maintain this rate for the balance of the year. ", "Let's take a look at capital expenditures, which include prepublication investments and purchases of property and equipment. In the second quarter, our prepublication investments were $75 million compared to $63.5 million for the same period last year. For 2007, we continue to project that prepub investments will be about $310 million. Purchases of property and equipment were up significantly this year to $60 million compared to only about $20 million for the same period last year. ", "The increase is driven, of course, by the construction of our new data center, which is underway and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2008, along with the technology investments we're making to digitize our products and services. We continue to project $250 million for 2007. ", "Now for some noncash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $57 million in the second quarter compared to $53 million for the same period last year. We ramped up our publishing schedule last year in anticipation of the very strong el-hi new state adoption opportunities in 2007, 2008, and 2009, and we continue to expect $260 million in amortization of prepublication costs for 2007. ", "Depreciation was $29 million for the second quarter compared to $28 million for the same period last year, and we expect $130 million for the full year, reflecting the higher level of capital expenditures in 2007 and full-year appreciation for capital expenditures paid in 2006. Amortization of intangibles was $11.5 million compared to $12 million for the same period and we expect $50 million for the year. ", "And, finally, unearned revenue grew to over $1 billion in the second quarter, which is up from $893 million for the same period last year, reflecting an approximately 15% year-over-year growth driven by continued growth in financial services. Last year included a mutual fund data business that was divested in March 2007. Excluding the fund business, the year-over-year increase would be even slightly higher than the 15%. Thanks. And now back to Terry. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Okay. Thank you, Bob. And that completes our prepared remarks. We're very pleased with the start of the first half of this year. It obviously was stronger than we expected and we're very pleased with that and we look forward to completing the year in good fashion with our guidance of double-digit earnings growth. With that let me turn it back to Don, and we'll go in any direction you'd like. ", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instruction) We'd now like to take your first question. ", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Peter Appert with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Terry, you referenced in your remarks the potential for possibly some margin compression in the second half of the year. I assume you're referring primarily to S&P, so could you quantify potentially with a you think the risk to margins might be in the second half? ", "And then secondly, just confirm that you were referencing S&P, or do you expect to see as well some margin pressure at the education and info services segment? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Thanks, Peter. As we said coming into this year, we expect margin improvement in all three segments and that will be the case. In the second quarter, for Standard & Poor's, the margin was 48.9%. Obviously, that's quite strong. ", "We did 43.9% at the end of last year and we said that each year going forward we expect margin improvement at S&P and that guidance continues. I don't think it's -- I don't think it's fair to say that we're going to be at 48.9% by the end of the year, but we still expect margin improvement and continued strength that way there. ", "On the education side, we've been very clear in terms of what our goal is and what our expectations are, and we've worked hard at this and we're off to a very good start in the K-12 space and a good start to the higher education year. So we expect improvement here and we expect improvement, again, in each year going forward and the same thing with information media. ", "We're off to a very good start to a year. When you have earnings at 31.7% in the second quarter, I don't think we can keep that pace going, so the second half will be at a little less of a rate on that one, but we expect to finish the year with double-digit earnings. ", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Right. Right. I understand that, obviously, you start very strongly and you expect the year to be up on a full-year basis, but I was specifically asking about the second half. And let me be more precise then. For the education business in the context of the revenue momentum you've seen, do you think you can sustain positive margin comps in the second half of the year? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Again, I would keep to where we are at, Peter, that we're going to see margin improvement here. Obviously, the third quarter is a big quarter in the education marketplace and we have to see how that comes, but we like our position right now and we'll see. ", "But, again, we expect margin improvement there and I think we have to see how this third quarter materializes to make any predictions that way. In this -- for the financial services side, Peter, we expect double-digit top and bottom growth in the second half. ", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks. Could I just ask one brief follow-up for Vicky, perhaps. There's been some discussion in the market about issuers shopping more aggressively for ratings in the context of some of the criteria changes you've talked about. So do you see any impact there, Vicky, if terms of the pipeline in your own business on a near-term basis? ", "Vicky Tillman", "Well, actually, as I indicated, we have been changing criteria at some of our assumptions and adjustments around it in a number of the different asset classes. I mentioned specifically residential mortgages, some of the covenant light, as well as commercial- mortgage-backed securities. ", "While that does sometimes have an impact because our subordination levels may increase and the types of protection that we have to have in deals may in fact sway issuers potentially not to come to S&P, but we believe in the long run because of our trans, by the way we're transparent in the market, and I think in the forefront in terms of allowing the market to understand why we do what we do that ultimately we're going to end up the year in a very good position relative to market share. ", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you. ", "Bob Bahash", "Peter, let me just add a comment on the education margin for the second half of the year. As you know, Terry had indicated that we have very strong outlooks for performance and science and in math and some of our big areas and we plan on doing very, very well. ", "Coupled with that, though, is very high marketing costs, as you know, free with order, et cetera, and they tend to place a little bit more pressure on margins in that initial sale period, so we're expecting a little bit of pressure on the margins in the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter, but we believe that our year is really excellent because of the penetration in terms of the adoption characteristics that we have. ", "But nevertheless, we're going to experience a little bit of margin pressure in the third and fourth quarter. We're trying to see what we can do to offset some of that, but nevertheless, that's about where we are right now. And that's why Terry had mentioned in his remarks that we expect some compression in margins for all the segments in the second half of the year. ", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lisa Monaco with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ", "Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. Terry or Vicky, could you just give us some color in terms of how much did second quarter at S&P come in better than expected and what are you seeing in the pipeline? Is the pipeline more robust than you had been seeing three months ago or were some deals pushed into 2Q ahead of some of these headlines about subprime we've seen? And then I have a follow-up. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Okay. Thanks, Lisa. The fact that we have Vicky here, I'm going to take advantage of that on that one, but let me begin by just saying that economic conditions worldwide are quite strong and are quite good. The corporate activity that we're seeing is impressive. ", "We're looking at very, very large merger and acquisition activity and the whole corporate and government sector is benefiting from that. In terms of other asset categories, we're also seeing enormous growth, not only here in the states, but in Europe and in Asia as well and we're benefiting from that, both in the asset-backed mark, the commercial mortgage-backed market, the CDO market, and so forth. ", "Certainly, the housing recession in the United States is costing the United States at least 1 percentage point of growth. We'll probably finish up the year at GDP growth of 2%, 2.5%, but it would be 3%, 3.5% if not for the housing recession, and it's -- the housing recession is winding down and by the end of '08, we should be in a very different position. ", "So the subprime market has been a smaller piece of the overall equation and, yes, that's had an affect, but the growth in the second quarter is an affect because of the growth worldwide and the push for structured instruments and the M&A activity. And, Vicky, would you like to respond to that? ", "Vicky Tillman", "Well, you pretty much covered and I would reiterate what you said. The fact that in the second quarter, I think the fact what was record issuance for corporate, I think Terry mentioned that it was a 34.5% increase, so a lot of the corporate issuance that we have seen probably over expectations. ", "Again, the other element of the experience that we're having is in our nontraditional products and in terms of the bank loan ratings that we're seeing tremendous push, not only in the U.S., but we are very much beginning to penetrate at a much more substantial rate, European bank loan market as well. ", "So in that regard, I think some of the experience we saw was actually at record breaking and that was unexpected, but it was good news and we see the fundamentals continuing through the second half. ", "Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "I guess, just to clarify on that, in terms of your second half outlook for S&P, is it about where you expected two, three months ago, or was some of that pulled into 2Q? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Again you're dealing with market conditions and it was a little bit more robust in the first half than we expected. Our guidance for the rest of the year is double-digit top and bottom line for S&P, but obviously at a lower rate than the very, very hot first half. ", "Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "Sorry to beat a dead horse, but there's been all these headlines about deals being sidelined, in terms of debt deals, is that impacting your business, or are strength in other areas offsetting that? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Yes, I would expect that. That, again, especially in the subprime and Alt-A area, there's going to be more caution going forward and I think that there will be some pressure on that, but, again, that is a smaller percentage of the overall ratings activity and we'll just have to see how that materializes in the third quarter. But I think it's fair to say that there'll be some softness in that. ", "Vicky Tillman", "Well, we saw some pullback, but I think a lot of that, as Terry indicated before, was a repricing in the deals, but we do see a strong pipeline coming in and as it relates to some of the loan market, what you're seeing is that they, especially with regards to CLOs, they're coming in with a more selective and tighter covenants as opposed to some of the light covenants that you've seen in the past. So there was some of that, but the pipeline is looking good. ", "Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "And then just on the margin front for financial in the second half, are there any unusual expenses we shall think about, or is there any ramp-up in investment spending that we should think about, just when we model out the margins? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Well, again, as you know, we're investing very heavily on the financial information side and we're very, very pleased with the customer penetration, with Capital IQ and the progress we're making there, and the acquisition in the second quarter of ClariFi, and we will continue to make those investments, but nothing out of the ordinary from that. ", "Lisa Monaco - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "You bet. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. ", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "Yes. Good morning. Just a couple things. Just to clarify this paragraph in your press release about the outlook. It just says low double-digit growth for financial services in the second half. Just to be clear, are you talking about the top line there, operating profit, or both? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Both. ", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then also, Bob, you mentioned just briefly you were expecting margin compression across all three segments in the second half, is that correct? ", "Bob Bahash", "That's correct, yes. ", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then lastly, just to clarify this, your subprime exposure on your ratings business, is it roughly about 5% of your revenues for that segment? ", "Bob Bahash", "Well, we don't break that out as such, but if you take a look at just the mortgage loan volume outstanding, subprime is only about 13% of that total market. So you're correct in the assumption that it is a smaller piece of that configuration. And, again, when you start moving up the credit curve and get into CDOs, you're seeing very, very strong growth and as I said in the second quarter, they were up 58%. ", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "So it sounds like you don't feel you're seeing fall off another round of subprime is going to slightly different classes? ", "Bob Bahash", "Again, everybody's watching the same picture and the question is, is there a spillover effect in the economy of subprime, and I think both, we've heard from Secretary Paulison and also Fed Chairman, Bernanke, saying that there is not a spillover and we're not seeing that. ", "And so, again, I think we're coming towards the end of the housing recession. We're looking at new starts bottoming out probably by the end of the year, and a little bit more to go in prices by spring of next year, probably about another 6% price decline to go. ", "And then we'll see some loss exposure and foreclosures probably through the end of next year. But, again, it's a smaller portion of the housing recession and from our standpoint, the strength in other areas are obviously doing quite well. ", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "And then, lastly, if I could, you mentioned total new issued dollar volume up 15.3% in the second quarter. According to Thompson, it looks like that data slowed significantly in the month of June. Can you verify that? And then it sounds like from your comments you believe it's going to rebound in July and August? What's your thoughts? Thank you. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Yes, well, there's two parts to that. One, we don't break out monthly data, but as Vicky said, the pipeline is quite strong and we don't see that letting up. But new issuance was just a little bit over 15% in the United States. The big one, though, Craig, is that in Europe new issuance is over 33% and we see that across the board in all asset categories. So that's going to be a stronger project, and remember, no, almost 40% of S&P's activity is outside the United States now, growing at a faster rate than domestically and we're going to continue to see that trend materialize. ", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thank you. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Thanks, Craig. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Choi with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Hi. A couple of questions here. First, Terry, your comment about the fourth quarter for S&P being a little bit more challenging in terms of comps. It's a little bit early, but comps will remain difficult for all of '08 then, given what's going on in the subprime market and if some maybe liquidity growing out of the credit market here, does this change your confidence about S&P's ability to deliver double-digit topline growth next year? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Well, it's a little early to get into 2008. I want to get through this year on this one. I feel very good about our guidance on double-digit growth, top and bottom line for S&P for the remainder of the year. Albeit, it's going to be at a lower rate and we have to see what the affect in some of the subprime there, but, again, it's going to be a smaller impact because of the strength overall, globally as well as in the corporate market. ", "But our planning process that is underway now for 2008, I think 2008 for Standard & Poor's is going to be a very good year. But it's too early to quantify that, and so we'll give guidance come December on what we expect on that one, but I have every reason to believe that it's going to be a very good year. ", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Second question is on management incentive compensation. Based on what I can see from your proxy, it looks like in the past management's incentive compensation maxes out when EPS growth is at 15% or so. Has that changed for 2007? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "No. ", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Lastly, I guess the question may be for Bob\u2026 ", "Terry McGraw, III", "And by the way, again, in terms of executive compensation, for it to kick in, to begin, it has to be double-digit growth. We feel very strongly on that given our markets and the growth drivers associated with those markets that our drive and desire is double-digit earnings growth and therefore we've aligned our set of process to kick in only with double-digit growth. ", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "And lastly, a question on the deferred revenues. Over what period of time do you expect to amortize the deferred revenues into your income statement? ", "Bob Bahash", "Generally, that's over an annual basis. ", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you. ", "Bob Bahash", "Thanks, Karl. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Meltz with Bear, Stearns. Please go ahead. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "Hi. It's Meltz over here. Two questions for you. Bob, I know the margin question's been asked a few time here, but you're saying margin's down year-over-year down in the second half. I'm not quite sure why the S&P margins would be down. I understand why the other two segments, I would like you to clarify that a little bit. And in that context, do you think, with your comments about margins, your comments about interest expense, do you think consensus -- full-year consensus of $305 million is achievable? And I have one follow-up. ", "Bob Bahash", "First off, I'm not going to comment on consensus, but let me talk to the margin issues. First off, S&P was off to, as you know, a very strong start, first half, second half and we had posted some very, very attractive margins there. What we're simply suggesting is that the growth rate, albeit double digit, will be significantly slower than in the first half of the year. And as a result, the margins will come in closer to the margins that we had achieved last year in the third and fourth quarters. ", "So this is not a collapse of margins, this is simply margins coming back to being more in-line with what we had achieved last year versus the much higher margins that we achieved because of the very, very strong growth that we achieved in the first and second quarters of this year. So hopefully that clarifies the issue with regard to margins for financial services. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "You're saying closer, not necessarily down? ", "Bob Bahash", "I'm saying right in that zone. It's very difficult to predict precisely, because our estimates are looking relatively close, and I'm saying relatively close to our performance of last year in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. So, yes, I'm saying, but down in relation to where they were. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "I understand. ", "Bob Bahash", "But in relation to last year, relatively close to where our performance was last year. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "Okay. One question. Vicky, you commented about the market share and I just want to make sure I understand. In RMBS or in CLOs, are you actually not getting deals at this point, similar or akin to Moody's comment last year, or are you just mentioning this is something that could happen? ", "Vicky Tillman", "I'm mentioning that we're going to adjust our criteria as we see fit, and if that requires higher subordination levels and higher support levels, it's then up to an issuer to make that choice in terms of whether they're going to go with S&P or not. ", "To date, we have made moves in adjusting our criteria and in some regards, especially in a collateralized mortgage-backed securities area, as you probably have read, we saw the changes in the real estate market a while ago, saw that the leveraging and the structuring of the deals and the underwriting was beginning to really begin to deteriorate somewhat and even further in the first quarter of '07, at which point again we called it like it was and just raised our requirements in terms of ratings. ", "This can in fact have an adverse impact on whether they come to Standard & Poor's or not, but that's not what we're concerned about. We're concerned about calling it as it is. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "And I understand, but my question is, do you think you have lost deals because of tightened standards in the past month and a half? ", "Vicky Tillman", "Not that I know of. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "Okay. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "It's more that it will be what it is as we go into the third quarter, but no, at this point, we don't see any. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "Okay. And last question. What were the shares out at the end of the quarter, please, diluted? ", "Bob Bahash", "Just a minute. We'll get that for you. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Shares were what, 350.3 million? ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "That was the weighted for the quarter, what was it at the\u2026 ", "Bob Bahash", "Yes, for the quarter, roughly 350.3 million. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "Weighted for the quarter and end of quarter? I'm asking for the end of quarter? ", "Bob Bahash", "That's weighted for the quarter. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "No. I know. But I'm asking what it was at the end after all the repurchase. ", "Bob Bahash", "Okay. We'll get you that. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "Okay. ", "Bob Bahash", "We'll pick it up somewhere during the call here. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear, Stearns & Co", "All right. Thank you. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Okay, Michael. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Atorino with Benchmark. Please go ahead. ", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Company", "Yes. I had a question on shares, which you'll answer. On interest expense, if you did not finish your purchase, would we -- would you set $12 million interest expense for the rest of the year per quarter? Or to put it another way, what would interest expense be for the rest of the year if you did not complete the share buyback? ", "Bob Bahash", "If we did not, we will be -- I think I had said something in the $42 million to $44 million range. If we complete it, the whole thing, probably somewhere around $30 million or so. ", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Company", "Okay. Thanks much. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Thanks, Ed. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Farman with Edgewood Management. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Alex Farman - Edgewood Management", "Congratulations on a good quarter. Are there any other suits like the June 5th suit that we should know about and where do they stand? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Alex, could you say that again? ", "Alex Farman - Edgewood Management", "Are there any other suits like the suit that you just mentioned, the June 5th ruling, and where do we stand on those things? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "No, there are no other suits and I don't anticipate them. Again, we are dogged in terms of the compliance function to our process and procedures and that's what we monitor very carefully and, of course, we worked with all government agencies in terms of doing that, but there are no suits outstanding. ", "Alex Farman - Edgewood Management", "And the international growth, what percentage of it\u2026 ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Yes, Alex, you're breaking up there. And we can't hear you very well, but if the question was on international growth, and it's about, for S&P, it's about 19% and it's growing at a very good rate and will continue at that rate for some time. ", "Alex Farman - Edgewood Management", "Thank you. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Thanks, Alex. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Fred Searby with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Fred? ", "Operator", "Fred, your line is open. Please check your mute button. We're not able to hear you. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "We're not hearing anything, operator. ", "Operator", "Yes, I'm not exactly sure what is wrong with his line. ", "Fred Searby - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.", "Hello? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Yes. There we go. Fred? ", " Operator", "We can hear you now, Fred, please go ahead with your question. ", "Fred Searby - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.", "Sorry about that, Terry. A couple questions. First, CDOs, it looks actually like you made a pretty accurate prediction for the second quarter, just came in slightly below, I think you'd said 65% originally. What would you think in terms of the third quarter? ", "And then secondly, a follow on Michael Meltz' question, but I would have thought that what I've gleaned that you would have actually gained market share because of Moody's tighter, more stringent rating criteria in CMBS, so I would have thought you would have some benefit, or I guess Fitch would have been the principal beneficiary. ", "Could you just elaborate somewhat on that? And then finally, just ABS (ph), I was surprised, it was a little better than we thought it would. Can you give us some components or thoughts of why, given some of the factors, what drove some of the upside there, at least from our perspective? ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Okay. Well, first of all, Fred, on the CDL market, as we all know, it is a very, very strong market and the pipeline going forward is also very, very strong. These are instruments of choice of institutional investors because they have so much flexibility, obviously, in getting the risk reward attributes that they want. And we will continue to see strong growth that way, but the only way I can really answer that is to say that the pipeline is full and is very strong. ", "On the asset-backed securities, we were a little surprised as well because we've been looking at the traditional areas of auto loans, student loans, credit card receivables and the like, and even though there's some softness on the automobile side, we're seeing strength elsewhere. And so it was good to see the asset back strong. And, again, across the board, when you break down all the categories, we're seeing considerable strength, and I think that pretends well for the economic conditions here and outside the United States overall. Bob, do you have a number on Michael Meltz's question? ", "Bob Bahash", "I don't have it now, but if we get it before we close, I'll refine, otherwise we'll post it on the site. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "You'll post it on the site. Okay, great. Okay, Fred? ", "Fred Searby - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.", "No. I appreciate it, but on the market share question, CMBS? I'm just\u2026 ", "Vicky Tillman", "Maybe I can respond to that. I said earlier that we saw some of the changes occurring and implemented and adjusted us our assumptions around the criteria for CMBS, we believe, earlier in the year than what Moody's did. So that had to be taken into affect. My understanding is, as well, is that Moody's did in fact change their criteria in April, but did was not effective until July. ", "So basically speaking, how they managed that is up to them, but we saw it, our criteria was in effect, we saw it, we let the market know about it, and once we understood the conditions that were weakening and that's in some of the structuring of the deals and the underwriting and the high leverage, once we saw that, we put it into affect immediately. And that may explain the market share difference. ", "Fred Searby - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.", "And was the principal beneficiary then Fitch? ", "Vicky Tillman", "I don't know the answer to that. ", "Fred Searby - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Terry McGraw, III", "Thanks, Fred. Fred, while we've got you, I think we have the Michael Meltz question here. ", "Bob Bahash", "Yes. For the month of June, the weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis was 349.5 million shares. ", "Fred Searby - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.", "Okay. ", "Operator", "Thank you.

In Education, we produced virtually all of ouroperating profits for the year in the third quarter. In 2007 we also faced anadditional challenge because of some of the difficult conditions in the creditmarkets. So I am especially pleased this morning with the results that we havejust announced for the third quarter. ", "Let me briefly re-cap some of the highlights.  Diluted earnings per share increased 26.4% to$1.34, versus $1.06 last year. Diluted earnings per share in the third quarterof 2006 included a $0.03 charge for restructuring. Net income grew by 18.2% andrevenue increased 9.8% to $2.2 billion. ", "I\u2019ll start this morning by reviewing how we achieved theseresults and then spend some time on the outlook for the McGraw-Hill Companiesand our guidance for 2007. But let me begin with our operations; and becauseeducation is such an important contributor to the third quarter, I\u2019m going tostart the segment review with McGraw-Hill Education. ", "Double-digit growth in the elementary-high school market,and margin expansion for McGraw-Hill education in the most important quarter of the year, are key takeaways for thissegment. In the third quarter revenue increased 9.9%. Operating profit grew by 16.1%.That included a pre-tax gain of $4.1 million on the divestiture of product linefor our parochial schools. In 2006, there was a pre-tax restructuring charge of$5.6 million.  The operating marginimproved to 35%, up from 33.1% for the same period last year. ", "Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education group grew at11.2%, and revenue for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional andInternational group increased by 8.1%. ", "2007 is the first of four robust years in the state newadoption market. To improve our competitive position at the start of thiscycle, we reorganized our base of operations a little over a year ago; and wewanted to do that in order to strengthen our sales, marketing and productdevelopment initiatives. ", "We also stepped up our new product introductions, to takeadvantage of the new opportunities in an expanding market. ", "Those decisions are starting to pay off. You can see it inour performance in this year\u2019s state new adoption market, which is growingfaster than our original forecast for the market. Some numbers will illustratemy point.", "In 2006, our School Education Group participated in about80% of the state new adoption market, and that was worth about $685 million;and we took a 20% share.  In 2007, ourreorganized School Education Group competed in virtually the entire state newadoption market, which is growing 14% to 20% and will be worth $780 million to$820 million this year. Our earlier forecast called for 10% to 15% growth and$750 million to $800 million range.", "This year we are taking an industry-leading 32% market shareof this expanded market, and we are very pleased with those results. ", "To achieve these results, the school education group led allcompetitors in California and South  Carolina for K-8 science and Grade 6 through 8 mathin Texas. We placed first in allsix states adopting music for the Elementary Grade. Treasures, which is our Kthrough 5 balanced basal reading program, led the market in Indianaand competed very well in Oregonand Tennessee.", "It is also worth noting that we had a 30%+ capture rates inboth the K-5 and Grade 6 through 12 state new adoption markets, anotherimportant indicator of improved across-the-board performance achieved through areorganized and better-led team.", "The breadth of our product offering is another key to oursuccess this year. In an education market that is not wedded to a singleinstructional approach, we offer a spectrum of products. So, in addition to oursuccess in Texas Math, we had core basal programs, we took share with EverydayMathematics, at reform based program. Everyday Math took the leading share in New  Mexico\u2019s K through 5 math adoption and sold very wellin the open territory, winning business in both urban and suburban markets. ", "Offering this spectrum of products also means we compete innon-academic subjects. In 2007 we captured significant business in small, butvery profitable markets, such as health, business education, technical andvocational education, as well as family and consumer science. ", "Even as we saw greater strength this year in the state newadoption market, we\u2019ve seen a slower than expected growth in open territory.", "We have some anecdotal evidence for this slow-down.Basically, it appears that non-discretionary costs in many districts are risingmore rapidly than funding. For example, schools are seeing a substantialincrease in fuel costs for transportation and heating and cooling. We areexamining these trends in the open territory and in more depth, to gain greaterunderstanding into changes that may be taking place there. ", "But we do expect, you know, to see some improvement here.According to industry statistics, the open territory market is down 1.4% aftereight months. Orders in the fourth quarter, and there are some possibilitieshere, could produce an uptake this year. ", "The supplemental market has been soft all year. There isless demand for traditional stand-alone supplemental products, especially thosethat are not clearly correlated with state standards, because the new corecurriculum programs in science, social studies, math and reading, are far morerobust than ever before. These new basal programs are all standards-based andthey now provide extensive ancillary materials for practice, differentiatedinstruction and other classroom needs formerly met with supplemental titles. ", "However, there is a steady growing demand for well-designedsupplemental intervention programs. That is, they are using the programs forstudents that are performing below Grade level. ", "The schools are most interested in intervention programsthat can demonstrate their efficacy with research data. That\u2019s why we arehaving good success with Kaleidoscope Literacy and Numbers World math programs.This is a promising development, and that will help us gain more traction inthe supplemental market.", "Strength in the state new adoption market will help offsetsome of the softness in the non-adoption state, which has been expected to growabout 4% in 2007. Because of the softness in the open territory, it now appearsthat the total high market will grow in the 3% to 5% range this year, insteadof the 5% to 7% originally forecasted. ", "Our school education group is outpacing the competition inboth the state new adoption market and in the open territories, and expects tooutperform the market for the full year.", "In testing, the performance in both custom and off-the-shelfmarkets has improved. We are seeing some encouraging developments in thismarket. In Indiana we recently won a one-year extension of our current Summit,those are the high stakes tests contract, plus a two-year contract beginning in2008 and a renewable for another two years. ", "We also won a five year renewal in West  Virginia. We are seeing some promising gains in theformative, or the low stakes end of the market, for our new acuity product.This program recently won a five year contract valued at $80 million dollars,from New York City.", "Earlier, I pointed out that the state new adoption marketlooks robust for the rest of the decade. Here\u2019s our latest forecast for thestate new adoption market through 2010; and obviously, in 2007, we have uppedit from $780 million to $820 million. For 2008 it goes from $900 million to$950 million, 2009 $850 million to $900 million, and then in 2010, $900 millionto $950 million; the issue being that it is very strong for the next four yearsand we expect to do very, very well with that.", "Our higher education professional and international groupcontinues to make good progress. In international markets we benefited fromstrong school sales in Canadaand in Spain,and a solid higher education selling season in Europe, Asiaand India. ", "In the US college and university market, our business andeconomics imprint set the pace in the third quarter, with solid gains in fourkey disciplines; accounting, economics, introduction to business, andmanagement. ", "We now think the UScollege and university market will grow between 5% and 6% in 2007; and weexpect to keep pace with the industry. Originally, we thought the market wouldgrow about 4% in 2007, and it\u2019s a little bit strong than we had expected. ", "Digital products are contributing to that growth across allof our college and university imprints, and in professional markets. ", "We expect more growth in the digital world with a debut thisfall of CourseSmart. This is a new college publisher cooperative e-book ande-commerce web site; and this is something really, I believe, to pay attentionto. This is a really strong new endeavor. Instructors logging on to CourseSmartwill be able to evaluate textbooks and related material in one convenientlocation. For students, CourseSmart offers a lower cost alternative and all thefunctionality of a web application. Our higher end group is starting with 148e-books. Over time thousands of textbooks will be available on this commonplatform. ", "Our online product offerings for professionals continue togrow, both here and abroad. Two new subscription-based specialty sitesintroduced this year; one is called Access Emergency Medicine that was done inJanuary; and Access Pharmacy in April was there; and they\u2019re off to very goodstarts with growing institutional sales. ", "Our professional books are also making the best-seller list.In September, one title, Rules for Renegades, a new title that made it ontofour best seller lists, was number 1 on USA Today\u2019s business list, number 2 onWall Street Journal\u2019s business list, number 14 on the Wall Street Journal\u2019snon-fiction list, and number 4 on the New York Times hard cover advice list. ", "So, summing up for the McGraw-Hill Education, a solid thirdquarter performance, and market share gains in the elementary high schoolmarket. We\u2019re very pleased with that performance. Good growth in highereducation, here and abroad. Digital products continue to gain traction inhigher education and professional market. We now expect the LI market to grow3% to 5% this year and 5% to 6% increase in the UScollege and university market; and operating margin for this segment willimprove for the full year.", "Okay. With that, let\u2019s go to the McGraw-Hill Financial Services.", "The third quarter started strongly and softened inSeptember; but we still met our guidance for this period by a comfortablemargin. In the third quarter revenue grew by 12.5%, operating profits increasedby 17.3%, and the operating margin expanded to 45.7%, up from 43.8% last year. Allthis was accomplished, even though there was a decline in the US structuredfinance market in the third quarter. ", "Credit quality issue, and the re-pricing and there-evaluation of risk, due in part to the concerns regarding the performance ofsub-prime mortgages, all contributed to that decline. But what kept Standardand Poor\u2019s growing in the third quarter was its resilient portfolio. ", "The strong performance included international creditratings, which grew at a double-digit rate and represented 41.6% of ratingsrevenue in the third quarter; non-traditional ratings in services, which alsogrew at a double-digit rate and now account for almost 26% of rating revenue;corporate and government ratings had solid performances; and financialinformation products and services also had very strong performance. ", "In short, the results underscore the successful action thatwe have taken over in the past several years, to strengthen Standard and Poor\u2019sdiversification and resilience. ", "Although new issue volume is an imperfect measure of ourperformance in any one period, recent issuance does illustrate the trajectoryof business in the third quarter. ", "As this chart indicates, after a slow start in July, therewas strong acceleration in new dollar issuance in the USindustrial market in August and September, and obviously for the third quarter.There also was modest improvement in the public finance sector, which wasencouraging.  But we saw a sharp declinein new issuance dollar volume in the USstructured finance markets as the third quarter progressed. ", "The following charts illustrate the pattern I\u2019ve justdescribed.

Corporate expenses in the third quarter of2006 included a $4.1 million charge for restructuring.  Excluding this charge, corporate expensesdecreased $5.4 million in the third quarter compared to a year ago.  The decrease is primarily driven by lowerincentive compensation versus the prior year, and a one-time gain from the saleof an equity investment.

In the third quarter of 2007 we sold anon-strategic product line -- Terry mentioned that -- within our K-12 businessthat resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.1 million.

Let me just sayagain, I am very pleased with the solid results for the third quarter, coupledwith the very strong results in the first half of this year.  In Education, we delivered in the mostseasonally obviously important quarter of the year.   I\u2019m very pleased with the McGraw-Hill SchoolEducation Group that we reorganized a year ago.

As youknow, in terms of Standard & Poor\u2019s we don\u2019t break out the individualcomponents on that. The financial information and services side is strong anddoing quite well.  Also on the fixedincome information side coming out of ratings as well, with RatingsDirect andRatingsXpress and things like that.

It had a little bit of effect on other issuance as well as I thinkeverybody that started took a little bit of a pause.  But the corporate and government side isquite strong, and we are already seeing significant pickup in opportunitiesthere. Again, for the obvious reasons, because of M&A activity and capitalexpenditures and so forth on that part.

So it has had an effectfor sure, but for the quarter, July and August were quite strong and Septemberis where it really had its effect.  Itwill have an effect going forward into the fourth quarter, but we see thatturning around and it is too early to start to get into 2008 projections.  We will see.

What\u2019s the averagematurity on both sides?", "Terry McGraw", "Craig, I think I better get some better information for youthan what I currently have.  For the mostpart we are seeing most things with intermediate terms on that one; ten years,in that area.  When you start talkingabout specific instruments, obviously it would all be different in theresidential mortgage-backed depending upon whether it was fixed or whether itwas adjustable and all those kind of things. Those are all packaged loans.  SoI don\u2019t want to give you an answer that I\u2019m not comfortable with, so we willget back to you with more information on that.  I would be thinking more inintermediate terms.", "Craig Huber - LehmanBrothers ", "What I\u2019m getting at here is because this is perhapsuncharted territory, the so-called bubble on the structured side.  What happens here if it takes multiple yearsfor structured finance to level off and start growing again?  Because then you are not replenishing thestuff that\u2019s already matured.  If thisgoes on for a few years so the surveillance fee would start to take a little hitand that has been a nice buffer for you guys. If this thing drags on long term, is that going to be a problem here?", "Terry McGraw", "Well, we are into subjective territory, Craig.  My opinion is just one.  I personally don\u2019t think a two-year timeframefor a credit crunch in the structured finance market to return isrealistic.  We are already seeing signsof things like the commercial mortgage-backed market starting to pick up againand I think it was just a pause that has been taken there because we had seen,since early 2005 that market do very well. ", "I think we have to assume that there is going to be somesoftness, certainly with CDOs and residential mortgage-backed securities, goingforward here.   I don\u2019t think that we are going to see anextended credit crunch.  I think thatwould have implications on the economy overall, and I don\u2019t think that would bein the best interests of the major lending institutions either.  So I just don\u2019t see that taking place.  ", "There is an enormous liquidity, as you know, that stillexists in the system because of all the worldwide surpluses and that still hasto be employed.

It sounds likestructured finance; what are magnitude you are thinking about now?.", "Secondly, implicit in your guidance are you expectinginternational revenues to be up double-digits still?

Can you talk a littlebit about what is going on with the expenses there?", "Terry McGraw", "Really, in terms of the guidance or the fourth quarter, weare trying to give you the best look that we have on it.  When we were doing the second quarterearnings and when we updated our guidance -- I think it was September 18th-- we were looking at a situation that was evolving at that point.  So we were saying it looked to us at thatpoint that the fourth quarter would probably be flat for FinancialServices.

The European markets are affected somewhat onthat one.  Again, what creates a creditcrunch in that one is more of an uncertainty and  almost a panic to say  hey listen, let\u2019s just lay low for a whileuntil we see what activity takes place. We are already seeing a pick up in activity in certain areas.  Our thinking is that things are starting tocalm down a little bit in all of that. But in terms of projections so that youhave got the best possible information from us, we are extrapolating out whatwe are seeing in September and October to date.

Do sales orders coming inrun  over between the end of September,into October and all of those kind of things. Sometimes there are those kind of issues.

With regard to the fourth quarter and how weconstructed our guidance here, as Terry pointed out it is an extension ofreally what occurred in September and what we are experiencing here in October;but when we look at external data as we gather market volume forecasts lookingat Thomson Financial Securities data, Harrison Scott data, et cetera, when welook at the U.S. RMBS and CDO forecast there are declines on a year-over-yearbasis because last year was so strong, in the 70% to 80% range.  Europe on the otherhand is not as dramatic but there are declines especially in RMBS and CMBS inthe 30% range.  That was the basis inguidance we used to instruct our forecast in the guidance we gave to you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karl Choi - MerrillLynch.

I believe that Moody\u2019s talkedabout 25% of restructured finance revenues coming from annual fees.  Can you give us a sense of a similarpercentage at S&P? Is it similar, higher or lower?", "A second question is related to the supplementals.  It sounds like from the trends you talkedabout, does it mean the supplemental softness can actually continue into 2008?", "Bob, can you give us the basic shares outstanding at the endof the quarter?", "Terry McGraw", "Yes, in the structured finance area, as you know again, andespecially towards the end of the year, it is more transaction driven on thatone.  Everything that we do is we try andpush things towards a broader surveillance there.  I would say and I will get you a number onthat, but I would say that we are higher than the 25%.  But again, right now given the fall off, atthis point of the year it is more transaction-focused.  On a yearly basis, we would be much heaviertowards surveillance on a fee basis.  Butat this point in time it is going to be more transaction driven.

With big programsnow and especially focused on social studies, math and science, reading, therequirements that are coming from the State are inclusive of a lot of differentadd-on products; online products, assessment products, all sorts ofthings.

We are on the right trackwith that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Atorino - The BenchmarkCo.", "Edward Atorino - TheBenchmark Co.", "The press release talks about weak revenues and softness ineducation.  You went down in education inthe fourth quarter. Why would that be?", "Terry McGraw", " ", "Ed, as you know, you know, the fourth quarter is relativelyvery small.  The third quarter is whereit\u2019s at.  The upside that we are lookingfor is on the higher education side because that is obviously a more globalbusiness and we\u2019ll see from that.  ", "But it is just that in terms of K-12, we did extremely wellin the third quarter.  I don\u2019t see anyreal timing issues here that it is into the third quarter and there won\u2019t bemuch spillover on that one.  So we arejust saying that it\u2019s in a very small quarter for education. We are not goingto see a lot of upside.  Where we arelooking for, and it\u2019s not in the numbers, is higher education.  Higher education could be some upside for usin the fourth quarter.", "Robert Bahash", "Let me clarify one point here.  The guidance called for a decline in revenuefor the corporation, really much driven by financial services. As Terry pointsout it is a relatively weaker quarter for MAG.", "Edward Atorino - TheBenchmark Co.", "It is softness in education?", "Robert Bahash", "Revenue, we are projecting revenue will increase.  But it is really driven the profit pressuresare driven by digital products and services.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Peter Appert - GoldmanSachs.  ", "Peter Appert -Goldman Sachs", "Terry, you are seeing in \u201807 obviously some impressiveimprovement in the profitability within the education segment.   I\u2019mwondering if in \u201808 do we see another equally dramatic step-up in profitabilityin the context of the revenue expectations you have outlined, or will thespending requirements for the new products mute the margin gains next year?", "Terry McGraw", "Again, it is a little early to start getting into \u201808 but itis a little bit clearer on the education side because the new adoption marketopportunity is big.  As you know, nextyear we have got science, we have got reading, we have got mathematics.  We have got California,we have got Texas.  You have some huge opportunities outthere.  ", "The important thing to us about \u201808 is how we perform in\u201807.  Because of the restructuring of theSchool Education Group, we needed to see strong, strong performance.  With the 32% market share and leading everystate that we are in, we are very upbeat about that.  As you know, the investment in \u201808 product ishas already taken place.  I would expectto continue to build on that in next year and that will be an important partfor us.", "Robert Bahash", "Peter, one of the influencing factors that we are going toexperience next year in 2008, as I mentioned earlier, we will have completedthe construction of our new data center, which will house -- it is reallycritical for us in terms of the movement to our digital product offerings.  The migration of our products and services,and all the platforms from the existing data center to the new data center willoccur throughout pretty much part of the first quarter, second, third andfourth quarters of next year.  Those willbe additional costs.  ", "We are really looking at them as one-time costs that willinfluence obviously performance next year. But it helps us to establish the right kind of platforms for our 24/7delivery across all our product lines. That\u2019s the only extenuating item that would influence our forecast fornext year.  ", "But again it is early on, as Terry pointed out.  We are not really into the budgeting processbut I wanted to point out that is one item we are looking at for next year.", "Peter Appert -Goldman Sachs", "How big would that item be?", "Robert Bahash", "Again we are not really into the budgeting side of things,but you are migrating all of the systems that exist for education, for the mostpart, are being migrated to the new center. So we will be incurring duplicate application costs, duplicate equipmentcosts as we do that migration and wind out of some of those leases that is wemay have when we complete that effort. So we were\u2019 formulating that now, but it is a one-time item that we aregoing to be faced with next year.", "Terry McGraw", "There are offsets to that and there will be savingsassociate associated as well.", "Peter Appert -Goldman Sachs", "The capital spending obviously has taken a big step up in\u201807.  Do you have a thought in terms ofwhat the run rate should look like on a go-forward basis in cap spending?", "Robert Bahash", "The big step up this year, of course, was driven by the datacenter getting up to 250 million so would I tend to think that next year,absent the data center, we are back down to the, most likely the $120 million to$140 million range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben [Slater] - Glenview Capital.  ", "Ben [Slater] - Glenview Capital ", "I was hoping you could provide a little more color on theguidance in Q4 for higher education versus K-12, and what sort of growth in highereducation is coming from price versus volume?", "Terry McGraw", "Again, the higher education side is a more steady.  The contribution quarter by quarter byquarter is more steady than it is in the K-12 area.  In the K-12 area, as you know, the firstquarter you are reflecting all the investments and that\u2019s why you are recordinglosses and you have to make it up in the third quarter.  ", "What we have seen is a very obviously strong third quarter forK-12.  The upside for us is on the education,the higher education side.  And we areseeing a stronger market this year than we had forecasted coming into themarket.  ", "So again, it is early on. If there is upside on the education side in the fourth quarter it isgoing to come from the higher education piece. And again, that\u2019s both price and volume.", "Ben [Slater] - Glenview Capital ", "Is it fair to say that your guidance for the educationsegment in total relates more to the K-12 segment and is due to timing morethan underlying weakness in the actual market?", "Terry McGraw", "Again, what we saw was mix shifts in the education thisyear.  The strong, strong new adoptionmarket in the K-12 side, we did very well with. We saw some softness in this supplemental area.  We picked that up in the new adoptionmarket.  ", "Also, the other one that we are watching very careful, are theopen territories.  The open territorieshave not grown over the last several years anywhere near where we think theyshould be.  We think that\u2019s going to beupside for \u201808.  But right now we alsoexpect that we might get a little uptick in the fourth quarter from the openterritories side.  ", "It is still very big; you are talking about almost $2billion that is being spent. The question is, is the growth on that?  Again, that\u2019s why we said 3% to 5% growth forthe market and we will do a lot better than that.  ", "On the higher ed side, it is a little bit stronger than weexpected, and so we moved that up to 5% to 6% for the market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Einhorn - Greenlight Capital.  ", "David Einhorn - GreenlightCapital", "", "As you look at the structured finance market, are thereparts of it that you feel, looking back, it is not a question that there is atemporary issue but maybe some of this just wasn\u2019t such a good idea to beginwith?", "Second, I\u2019m wondering how you view Standard & Poor\u2019sfrom a brand and what might be happening to the brand as a result of what\u2019sgone on in the structured finance market. Thanks so much.", "Terry McGraw", "David, the market is what the market is and what we do isprovide access to the capital markets and provide, in the structured area, creditratings that relate to the risk a particular instrument has in terms ofdefaulting on its interest or on its principal payments.  ", "The structured finance market is a market that institutionalinvestments like, and a lot.  The reasonis because with structured product, you can divide them up into tranches andyou can get just the risk/reward characteristics or attributes that you arelooking for in terms of your own portfolio construction on that one.  ", "If the market wants those kind of products and theinstitution investors want those products, then we move with the market and weare going to rate whatever on that part. Given the current environment, I think what you are going to see is moreof a flight to quality and less to speculative grade on that. We are reflectingthat now.  ", "In terms of Standard & Poor\u2019s as a brand, no; I mean, youare constantly growing, you are constantly learning, you are constantlyinvolved in not only the ratings side of the market but providing thetransparency in terms of all the financial information products.  ", "We take that responsibility very seriously and thecredibility that S&P has as a brand in terms of serving the markets in alot of areas, here and around the world, is only going to grow with the growthof the capital markets.  The long-termtrends here -- privatization, securitization, the whole global movement, thedisintermediation away from the banks into the capital market -- those trendsare undeniable.  That\u2019s what is growingthis.  That is why the U.S.capital markets are extremely sophisticated and solid, and so too are theEuropean markets and the Asian markets.  ", "Those trends are what are driving it and we are acenterpiece right in the middle of all that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Katrina Fallin - Citi.  ", "Katrina Fallin - Citi", "I was hoping you could broaden your comments a little bitabout your buyback plans.  With 35million shares left in the \u201807 program, what\u2019s your philosophy around continuedbuybacks? Should we expect a similar pace of buybacks in Q4 that we saw in Q3?", "Terry McGraw", "When we start talking about share repurchase now, this is aboard of directors\u2019 authorization and that\u2019s where it that is to come.  I can give you my own sentiments that I thinkthat in terms of what we see, in terms of our growth trends and ouropportunities going forward, I think they are solid, they are strong.  We very much like a share repurchaseprogram.  We have completed ourauthorized portion so far in \u201807.  We havea board meeting coming up and I guess that might get discussed.", "Katrina Fallin - Citi", "", "Just one further question on the ETF on S&Pindices.  Nice growth there, $209billion.  How much of that is through organicgrowth of the funds versus acquired growth through some of the new indices thatyou purchased?  What are your thoughtsaround additional opportunities for acquisitions there?", "Terry McGraw", "Well again, most of what we do is organic.  We are constantly developing thosecapabilities.  Where we can acceleratethat through an acquisition such as the Goldman Sachs indices on commodities andso forth, we will do that. ", "So most of it is organic. It is a wonderful area and whatyou are doing is you are creating investable benchmarks and there are endlesspermutations to the type of benchmarks that you can develop.  ", "So here, around the world, that effort will continue and weare working with lots of different exchanges and large institutional investorsto develop whatever they want in that area. Because you can measure things in any dimension; so again, withbenchmarks you can go in a lot of directions. Most of that is organic.", "Katrina Fallin - Citi", "Do you give any color around the contribution margin forthat business?", "Terry McGraw", "Yes.  It is high.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Michael Meltz - BearStearns.  ", "Michael Meltz - BearStearns ", "Bob, I think you said the corporate line benefited from aone-time equity gain.  What was that, andcan you size that?  Following up onPeter\u2019s question, this is, I think, the first time I\u2019ve heard about theseredundant costs next year.  Understandingthey are one-time, it would be helpful if at this point you could put it into context.  Is this a $10 million charge or is this a $50million type of hit?", "Terry McGraw", "First off, it was an equity investment that we had.  I\u2019m not going to go any further than that.But it was roughly $3.6 million was the gain that is embedded within corporateexpense.  We have been talking about theconstruction of the new data center now for the past year or so.  Obviously coming with a new data center is,implicit in that is the movement and shifting of all our technicalcapabilities, our applications and such, fitting it with hardware, moving itinto that.  That\u2019s simply a bigprocess.  ", "I\u2019m simply highlighting that there is an item here.  This is not something that is astronomicaland is going to influence the overall performance of the enterprise.  It is just something that I\u2019m just pointingout.  We will size that for you as we gofurther in the course of the year, but just simply pointing out that this is aneffort that\u2019s going to go on next year and it is the transition costs that areone-time. That\u2019s all I\u2019m referring to.", "Michael Meltz - BearStearns ", "Your comment on shares out, the 329 million, was that adiluted or basic number at the end of the quarter?", "Terry McGraw", "That was a basic number.", "Operator", "We do have another question from Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch. ", "Karl Choi - MerrillLynch ", "Just within Financial Services, wondering if there was anyreversal in incentive compensation accrual in the quarter? ", "Bob, if you have a figure for how much headcount would be upyear-over-year in the fourth quarter for Financial Services?", "Robert Bahash", " ", "With regard to incentive compensation, an influencing factor-- without getting into how much -- was simply because of the performance andthe outlook for the year as it relates to last year, you may remember last yearwas very, very strong and the expectation was for a very strong fourthquarter.  We were building incentiveaccruals as we went through the course of the year.  ", "Now this year, with the weaker performance in September andthe outlook going forward, the incentive accruals are lower.  So that influenced the overallperformance.  I\u2019m not going to get intothe specifics of numbers.  But it didinfluence the performance and did influence the fact that our margin was higherare on a year to year basis.  ", "With regard to headcount, as Terry pointed out, we arelooking very, very hard at the organization, but keeping in mind that we have aresponsibility to provide quality products and services.  We have surveillance that we are going to beadhering to.  But we are looking acrossother parts of the lines to be certain that we are staffed accordingly, basedon what we are facing in the next six to nine months.", "Terry McGraw", "Karl the other aspect is the whole cross-training initiativewithin the ratings division. They move things around depending upon where therevenue growth is but everything is being looked at.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude this morning\u2019s call.

", "At this time, I'd like you inform you that the call is being recorded for broadcast and that all participants are in listen-only mode.", "At the request of the company, we will open the conference to questions and answers after presentation, and instructions will follow at that time.", "To enhance the call for today's participants, McGraw-Hill has made the presenters' slides available on the Internet.

(Operator Instructions)", "I will now turn the call over to Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the McGraw-Hill Companies.", "Sir, you may begin.", "Donald Rubin - SVP, IR", "Thank you and good morning. And thank everyone for joining us here at the McGraw-Hill Companies' fourth quarter earnings call.", "I'm Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at the McGraw-Hill Companies. With me today are Harold McGraw, III, Chairman, President and CEO, and Robert Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning we issued a news release with our fourth quarter and full year 2007 results. We trust you've had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.McGraw-Hill.com/Investor_Relations. Once again, that's www.McGrawHill.com/Investor_Relations.", "Before we begin this morning, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

", "We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call, however this call is for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Frank Briamonte in our New York office at area code 2125124145. 5124145. And do that subsequent to this call. Thank you.", "Today's update will last approximately an hour. After our presentations, we will open the meeting to questions and answers. ", "It's now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Okay. Thank you very much, Don, and good morning, everyone. And again, thank you for taking time to be with us, and welcome to our review of the fourth quarter for the McGraw-Hill Companies and for the full year 2007.", "Joining me on the conference call will be Bob Bahash, who's our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin by reviewing our results and the outlook for 2008, and then Bob will review our financial performance, and after his remarks, we'll be pleased to go in any direction anyone would like, any questions or comments about the McGraw-Hill Companies. ", "Well, by now we all know that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates 75 basis points two days ago in an effort to make sure that the recession that many are so concerned about will be mild and will be brief, it if occurs at all.", "David Wyss, who is Standard & Poor's Chief Economist, currently thinks the odds of the U.S. economy slipping into a recession - a slight recession - are about 50:50. In assessing economic growth, he thinks the peak probably occurred last November, and that the trough will come this year in September or October, somewhere in that area.", "As we also know, the housing recession will continue to be with us throughout the year. New housing starts should bottom out sometime in the spring, and housing prices will hit bottom probably sometime this fall or perhaps toward the end of 2008, but it's unwinding.", "And by the way, David Wyss expects to see more rate cuts this year from the Federal Reserve, with the next one coming certainly in March and probably April if not sooner.", "With that as a brief background, let's review the operations, and let me start with McGraw-Hill Education", "Some late ordering in the Elementary-High School Market and a solid close in higher education in the fourth quarter put finishing touches on a substantial accomplishment for McGraw-Hill Education in 2007. ", "Revenue for the year increased 7.2%, operating profits grew 21.5%, reflecting the restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2007 and in the second half of 2006. ", "The operating margin was 14.8% versus 13% in 2006.", "In the fourth quarter, we did a little better than our guidance. Revenue increased 4.3%. Including a restructuring charge, there was an operating loss of $791,000. Excluding the restructuring charges, operating profits increased 5%. Including the restructuring charges, the operating margin declined but was unchanged compared to 2006, when the restructuring charges are excluded.", "The McGraw-Hill School Education Group's revenue increased 6.8% in 2007 and by 6% in the fourth quarter. We don't have final 2007 industry figures, but after 11 months, industry sales were up 2.6% versus the same period in 2006. ", "The key to our results was a very strong performance in the state new adoption market. We captured a market-leading 32% of a market that grew by about 19% to approximately $820 million.", "We built this record with new products and services and a successful reorganization of what had been a separate K through 5 and a 6 through 12 operation. The new team obviously got the job done in both the K-5 and the 612 markets and positioned us well for the rest of this decade.", "It is an advantage, obviously, to have your team ready to go in a consolidating market where some of the competition is reorganizing and is encumbered with high levels of debt.", "For 2008, we are again looking at a healthy state new adoption calendar. We expect the state new adoption market to grow by 10% to 15% in 2008 to $900 to $950\u00a0million. Once again, we will be competing in virtually the entire market.", "The three biggest state new adoption opportunities this year are in California for K through 8 mathematics, Florida for K-5 reading, and Texas for K-5 math, and we're well positioned in all of these adoptions with new programs carefully tailored to meet state standards.", "Our success in 2007 with elementary school programs will also benefit us in 2008. Elementary programs tend to include more consumable materials and other items that generate residual orders in subsequent years. ", "Offering a broad spectrum of products has been a key part of our El-High strategy for some time. We compete in both academic and nonacademic areas of the curriculum. Our strong market shares in art and music, family and consumer science, technical and vocational education, and health and business education contribute significantly to our results each year.", "In a still emerging segment of the El-High market, we are achieving steady growth with intervention programs. Demand for these programs continues to grow as educators seek well-designed, research-based materials for students who need the extra help to reach grade level standards. ", "The increasing importance of this market was underscored when both Florida and California adopted intervention programs for purchase this year. Florida lists our Jamestown Reading Navigator, an online intervention program developed for secondary school students and sold by subscription. California added a math intervention category for 2008, and three of our programs have approved in that category. Each program is designed to complement one of our three adopted basal math series.", "Across the country, our strong line-up of skills-based intervention programs contributed to our success in 2007 and should do so again in 2008. These include updated versions of Numbers World, Language for Learning, and a recently acquired product line, Reading Success. Science Snapshot is a new multimedia intervention program which also shows tremendous promise.", "Two satellite programs associated with our elementary reading series Treasures, Triumphs for intervention needs and Treasure Chest for English language learners, are also generating incremental revenue. ", "A broad spectrum of products and strong state new adoption sales are the key to 2008. The open territory is this year's wild card. We anticipate growth of 1% to 2%, but after two years of lower-than-expected sales for the industry, there's very likely pent-up demand in the open territory, particularly for the new basal programs and for standards-based, research-validated intervention materials.", "Limited increases in federal funding and pressures on local and state budgets could be inhibiting factors this year in the open territory growth. Overall, we expect the Elementary-High School Market to grow 4% to 5% in 2008.", "Our testing business improved in 2007 with gains in custom as well as in shelf revenue, and we expect more progress in 2008. The recently enacted federal education budget will keep all of No Child Left Behind's major programs intact, including state accountability testing. We're not surprised. The public's insistence on accountability in the classroom has not abated. ", "Accountability is the driver behind the growth of our new formative assessment program called Acuity. With Acuity's benchmark test, educators can diagnose students' learning needs in relationship to state standards and adjust instruction throughout the year to ensure improved performance on the big year-end No Child Left Behind test.", "Acuity is now in use at the district level in many states across the country. Its biggest victory last year was the $80 million, five-year contract with New York City. The program's first state-level win in Indiana and West Virginia were announced in the fourth quarter. These contracts will produce revenue in 2008 and beyond.", "In 2008 as in 2007, we expect that states and districts will continue to increase their expenditures on formative and English language learning testing. Our LAS Links assessment program is very successful in the English language learner market. ", "During the year, we will also continue to invest in innovative testing products as well as new technology to improve efficiencies in developing, delivering and scoring McGraw-Hill assessments.", "Now let's turn to our Higher Education and Professional and International Group. Revenue for this group grew by 7.6% for the year and by 3.4% in the fourth quarter. ", "The digital transformation of the education business is furthest along and moving most rapidly in the higher education and professional markets. Our digital product revenue grew substantially faster than our revenue from traditional products in 2007 and undoubtedly will do so again in 2008.", "We expect the U.S. college and university market to grow 3% to 4% in 2008, and we will outperform that again this year. Digital products and services will be one of those keys.", "The student-to-computer ratio on today's college campus is essentially 1 to 1. Recent studies show that more than 90% of students have high speed Internet access. With digital products like Homework Manager and eBooks, we are increasingly successful in meeting the needs of today's college students.", "The ongoing digital transformation means we must continue investing to deliver great content and great tools for course management, online instruction courses and e-books and paper-based products are replaced by electronic products.", "Not surprisingly, the demand for digitally delivered products is most advanced in the professional world. Our digital subscription revenue continues to grow faster than conventional product sales as we expand our offerings in science, medicine and engineering.", "So with that, let's sum up for McGraw-Hill Education - 6% to 8% top line growth in 2008, margins may decline slightly, 50 to 100 basis points due to accelerating investments in technology, increased pre-publication amortization costs.", "Now let's turn to McGraw-Hill Financial Services. ", "The year started very strongly, enabling the segment to produce solid growth in 2007. ", "Revenue for the year increased by 10.9%. ", "Operating profit, including a pretax gain of $17.3 million on the divestiture of a mutual fund business and an $18.8\u00a0million pretax restructuring charge, operating profit grew by 13.1%", "The operating margin for the year was 44.6%, up from 43.8% last year.", "As we predicted, the decline in the structured finance market that started last September carried into October, November and December. ", "To illustrate the falloff in new issuance, we provided a table in today's earnings release that contrasts strong U.S. new issue dollar volume for the first nine months of 2007 with the sharp decline in the fourth quarter of 2007. ", "In this next chart, you also can see how new issuance for the final three months of 2007 compared with the extremely robust fourth quarter of 2006.", "Those tough comparisons are reflected in our fourth quarter results in 2007. ", "For 2007, the fourth quarter revenue declined by 7.2%, operating profit, including a restructuring charge, decreased by 22.8% or 17.2% excluding the restructuring charge, and the operating margin fell to 35.8% and including the restructuring charge, or 38.3% excluding the charge. ", "The very different results from the first nine months of 2007 and the fourth quarter illustrate both the challenge but the opportunity for 2008. We obviously start the year facing tough comparisons and the prospect of slower growth rates in the first half compared to 2007. We will end the year facing much easier comparisons at a time when the markets may be showing signs of recovering.", "During 2008, a number of factors will come into play as the Federal Reserve cuts rates this year, as additional liquidity is pumped into the financial system, as buyers and sellers agree on appropriate risk-return yields, as companies have more maturing debt to refinance, and as the backlog of deals starts to come to the market.", "In short, as the liquidity freeze begins to thaw - and that's exactly what it is, a liquidity freeze; liquidity is there - but as that liquidity freeze begins to thaw and confidence returns, the market will find firmer footing in the latter part of 2008.", "In the meantime, we will continue to manage costs very tightly and take advantage of our opportunities inherent in the diversified portfolio that we have created in financial services. That combination will produce growth for the segment and enable us to hold the operating margin decline in 2008 to between 125\u00a0basis points and 225 basis points.", "In considering diversity, let's start with Standard & Poor's Investment Services, and here's where the revenue grew by 15.6% in the fourth quarter and 16.3% in 2007 to reach $782 million for the full year.", "These financial data and information index and research services produced 26% of Financial Services' revenue in 2007. With a growing family of liquid and investable indices and products like Capital IQ and Compustat and analytics from the recently acquired Clarify, we expect another year of solid growth from S&P Investment Services in 2008.", "Revenue from Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services, our ratings business, is diversified in terms of geography, fee structure, product mix, and in short, ratings is not all about structured finance or new issuance in the United States.", "Financial Services starts the year with deferred revenue of approximately $790\u00a0million, most of which will be recognized over the next 12 months. That's about 25% of the segment's 2007 revenue. We expect deferred revenue to continue growing in 2008, albeit at a slower pace because of the current market conditions.", "Revenue from non-transaction sources - surveillance fees, annual contracts and subscriptions - provide resilience when new issuance slows. At the end of 2007, nontransaction revenue represented 54% of the ratings business. Nontransaction revenue will be more important in 2008 as new issuance volume, particularly in the U.S. structured finance market, declines.", "We also expect growth overseas. We continue to enhance our rating coverage in international markets by expanding in Central and Eastern Europe, the Persian Gulf and South Africa - Turkey as well - opening new offices in Dubai, Tel Aviv, Johannesburg, and so forth. International revenue represented just over 40% of ratings revenue in 2007 and undoubtedly will be a bigger portion of ratings this year. ", "Growth in nontraditional ratings will also be important in 2008. Demand by financial institutions for credit risk models, tools, data, and training - primarily for Basel\u00a0II compliance - will be a plus in 2008. ", "At the end of 2007, ratings and services that are not directly linked to the new public debt issuance accounted for 25.5% of ratings revenue. Non-traditional revenue will also make a bigger contribution in 2008.", "There's one more critical point to make about diversity at Financial Services. For some time, we've pointed out that we were reducing our dependency on new issue volume. Today I want to show you the disparity between the new issue dollar volume in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the revenue at the segment level and at Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services.", "As you can see in this table, revenue for the segment declined 7.2% in the fourth quarter, while global new volume issuance dropped 33.2% for the same period.", "Go down a level. S&P Credit Market Services was off 14.1% versus a 33.2% drop in global new issue volume. ", "International revenue at Credit Market Services in the fourth quarter was off only 4.3% as non-U.S. new issuance dropped 24.2%.", "Our new issue figures are based on the domicile of the issuer, only when deals are issued, not when they're priced, and only the rateable part of the market because that is the true measure of our opportunity.", "There's a lot more detailed information to absorb, so let's take a moment to sum up. ", "Financial Services starts the year with $790 million of deferred revenue. We have high expectations for our non-ratings business, Standard & Poor's Investment Services - which produces 26% of our segment's revenue - and international ratings revenue, which has been growing at double-digit rates and now represents more than 40% of Credit Market Services' revenue should continue to grow, offsetting a decline in domestic ratings in 2008.", "Non-traditional products and services have been growing faster than traditional ratings. We expect that trend to continue in 2008. These products and services now represent just over 25% of Credit Market Services' revenue.", "With the anticipated slowdown in issuance this year, we also expect a bigger contribution from surveillance fees, annual contracts and subscriptions, the nontransaction portion of Credit Market Services.", "And let's not overlook the huge corporate market. Corporates will continue to grow in 2008. Interest rates remain low, and that will help continue to drive debt-financed strategic merger and acquisition deals and investments in infrastructure. Companies will have more maturing debt to refinance this year. One estimate puts corporate investment grade bond maturities in 2008 at just over $600\u00a0billion, up from $483 billion in 2007. Financing conditions remain favorable overseas.", "The elephant in the room, of course, is structured finance. This is predominantly a transaction-based market, and in 2007 new dollar volume issuance in the United States' structured finance market decreased by 22.2%. ", "We expect conditions in the U.S. structured credit markets to be challenging for most of 2008. Mortgage issuance is expected to decline significantly in the residential sector because of adverse conditions in the housing market, tightening lending standards, and a shift to agency origination.", "As a result, we expect the U.S. residential mortgage-backed security dollar volume issuance to decline significantly in 2008 after falling by 40.4% in 2007.", "But it's worth noting that the residential mortgage-backed security issuance in Europe grew by 53.2% in 2007 as the total structured market increased there by 33.3%. ", "The U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities new issue market tumbled in the fourth quarter by 56% and finished up 6.8% for the year 2007. The outlook here is uncertain as pension funds and insurance companies - typical buyers\u00a0- have stayed on the sidelines. ", "New issue dollar volume in the U.S. collateralized debt obligation market - CDO market - finished up by 1.4% in 2007, but a flight to quality will result in a significant decline in the U.S. CDO issuance in 2008.", "The asset-backed securities market has better prospects. We should see increases in what we would call plain vanilla asset-backed securitization as credit card receivables replace home equity loans and issuers of auto loans tap this market.", "S&P Credit Market Service will also benefit from strong demand for two of its key information products - that's Ratings Direct and Ratings Express. These global products continue to grow rapidly. ", "We've come through a difficult time in credit markets, and undoubtedly there will continue to be headline risk in 2008 on the regulatory and legal fronts. The lack of legal or factual merit doesn't seem to deter some critics, but we are confident that Standard & Poor's will be part of the solution that emerges over the coming months.", "S&P is working closely with regulators here and around the world. It is to our benefit obviously to do so, and we will continue to do so to the best of our ability.", "S&P is also working on some important initiatives that will be made public shortly. We think these new initiatives will underscore our efforts to strengthen the rating process and better serve markets.", "So summing up now for Financial Services, diversity is more important than ever for 2008. Revenue will grow 2% to 4%. The operating margin will decline no more than 125 basis points to 225. Slow growth in the first half, followed by a pick up in the second half.", "All right, and finally moving to the Information and Media segment, growth in information products and services was the key factor in Information and Media's performance in 2007.

That includes news and pricing serviced delivered online to the world energy market and improved market penetration with studies and proprietary services from J.\u00a0D.\u00a0Power and Associates as well as growth in the Asia Pacific markets.", "Growth in information products also helped to offset the decline at our Broadcasting Group. In a non-political year, Broadcasting Group's revenues were off 14.6% in 2007 and 14.9% in the fourth quarter. Of, 2008 is a political year so we expect to see a big rebound at Broadcasting.", "We expect advertising to stabilize at Business Week. The publication is holding its rate base at 900,000 while increasing ad rates by 4% over 2007. The oneyear subscription price will remain at $59.97.", "In the information business, we will continue to migrate to higher value-added opportunities ranging from online syndicated studies from J. D. Power and Associates to the growth in subscription-based products in the energy markets.", "Summing up, then, for the Information and Media segment, 68% top line growth in 2008, increased political advertising at Broadcasting, more growth in information products, and an improved operating margin.", "Okay, that wraps up the outlook for our three segments. To recap and to go through our guidance one more time, revenue growth of 6% to 8% for McGraw-Hill Education and McGraw-Hill Information and Media, and 2% to 4% growth for McGraw-Hill Financial Services. ", "In Financial Services, the diversity and the breadth of the portfolio will again be the significant factor in its performance in 2008. The negative impact of the segment's operating margin from the falloff in structured finance will be partially offset by growth in other rating markets and by Standard & Poor's Investment Services. As a result, the segment's operating margin may decline between 125 and 225\u00a0basis points in 2008. Continued uncertainty in the financial markets could impact this.", "At McGraw-Hill Education, we expect operating profit to grow in the low single-digit range because of a substantial increase in pre-publication costs due to the demand associated with the new adoption markets, and stepped up investments in technology to accelerate the digital transformation of our business. Consequently, the operating margin in this segment may decline 50 to 100\u00a0basis points in 2008.", "In Information and Media, we anticipate improvement in the operating margin. As a result, we now expect to produce another year of growth with earnings per share increasing 3% to 5% for the corporation in 2008.

We expect a better performance in the second half to finish 2008 on an upswing and positioning us well for 2009.", "With that, let me turn it over to Bob and his remarks, and then we'll go to any questions.", "Bob?", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "Okay. Thank you, Terry. ", "I'll begin this morning with an update on our share repurchase program. We continued our buyback program in the fourth quarter, purchasing 7\u00a0million shares at a cost of $322.7 million. This brings our full year total to 37 million shares for a cost of approximately $2.2 billion.", "Through a combination of share repurchases and an increased dividend, the McGraw Companies returned approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2007, demonstrating management's commitment to increasing shareholder value.", "Since 1996, we have returned approximately $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.", "Last October, the Board signalled its approval for the repurchase of the remaining 35 million shares over time from the 2007 repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. MHP purchased 7\u00a0million shares in the fourth quarter of 2007, as I previously stated, and we now start 2008 with 28\u00a0million shares remaining in this program.", "On January 30, the Board will review the cash dividend at its regularly monthly meeting. The Board has raised the cash dividend annually for the last 34\u00a0years. Since 1974, the dividend has grown at a compound rate of 10.4%.", "Now, share repurchases are impacting shares outstanding, debt and interest expense, so let's look at these items now.", "Because of the share buybacks, diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined in the fourth quarter to $330.8 million shares. This reflects a $7 million share decrease compared to the third quarter of 2007 and a 33.4 million share decrease compared to the same period last year.", "Our net debt position at the end of December was $801 million, down about $77\u00a0million from a net debt position of $879 million at the end of the third quarter. As of year end, on a gross basis our debt is approximately $1.2 billion offset by $396 million in cash, primarily in foreign holdings. This compares to 2006 when we were debt free and had a cash position of about $353 million. This change is primarily due to the share repurchases.", "The debt is comprised of $1.2 billion of unsecured senior notes issued in November of 2007 and is spread evenly across 5, 10 and 30-year tranches, adding term debt to our capital structure.", "We ended the year with no commercial paper outstanding, but we do plan to enter the commercial paper market in 2008 due to the seasonal nature of our businesses.", "Interest expense was $12 million in the fourth quarter compared to only $70,000 in the same period last year. For the full year, interest expense was $40.6\u00a0million. For 2008, we project interest expense in the range of $80 to $100\u00a0million.", "Let's now look at our corporate expenses. Corporate expenses increased $5.2\u00a0million or 12.6% to $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The fourth quarter includes a pre-tax restructuring charge of $1.9 million for the elimination of 21 positions. For comparison purposes, the fourth quarter 2006 results included a $2.7\u00a0million pre-tax restructuring charge.", "The year-over-year increase is driven by increased incentive compensation as well as expenses related to our corporate program to improve operating efficiency, business process management or BPM. In addition to operating efficiency programs across the entire corporation, other programs include reviewing our digital publishing workflow systems, related offshoring activities, and other general business process improvements. For 2008, we expect a low single-digit increase.", "As Terry discussed, we expect operating profit at McGraw-Hill Education to grow in the low single digit range. I'd like to spend a few minutes elaborating on several of these factors.", "First, as a result of significant pre-publication investments, 2008 will incur a substantial increase of approximately $45 million in pre-publication amortization. ", "Second, as Terry pointed out earlier, the digital transformation in education market requires increased investments in technology. ", "The trends are unmistakable:  In the Elementary-High School Market, we're seeing a growing number of states requiring more technology products for all disciplines. Understandably, they want to provide teachers with a broad spectrum of tools to help improve student learning. The computer is the ultimate tool for individualizing instruction and rapid measurement of results. ", "In testing, it is clear that the paper-and-pencil world is giving way to online products and services that meet the classroom technology requirements of educations. In this market, we must invest in technology to keep our products at the cutting edge, launch new ones, and to improve efficiency to help relieve the margin pressures that we are currently experiencing in our testing businesses.", "In higher education, today's college freshman were born five years after the Apple Macintosh was introduced. These students do now know a world without laptops, desktops, iPods and high bandwidth connectivity. An estimated 3.5\u00a0million college students are taking one or more courses online.", "The convergence of content and technology is furthest along in the professional markets. In the global medical information market, more than 50% of the content today is accessed digitally. Clearly, technology is transforming the education market and to maintain and improve our competitive position, we must continue to invest.", "In addition to the significant investments in technology we must make in education, we anticipate $18 million in costs for this segment in 2008 related to the migration to our new state-of-the-art data center, and I'll come back to this point in a moment.", "In light of these factors, we expect that the operating margin at McGraw-Hill Education may decline 50 to 100 basis points in 2008. Given the expected decline in margins in 2008, we no longer expect to achieve a 20% operating margin by 2010, but we remain committed to improving McGraw-Hill Education's operating efficiency and its operating margin. Since investments, expenses and revenues vary from year to year, the operating margin doesn't necessarily increase in a straight line, however we remain focused on various efforts that together will result in a higher operating margin for the education segment.", "To help our prospects, we restructured business operations in the fourth quarter and incurred a pre-tax restructuring charge of $16.3 million for severance relating to a workforce reduction of 304 positions.", "Now let's switch over to unearned revenue, which was approximately $1.1 billion for 2007 and represents 10.4% year-over-year growth. About $790 million or 73% of that unearned revenue comes from S&P's surveillance and fee structures and data and information products. We expect unearned revenue growth to moderate given the slower revenue growth forecast. This revenue will be largely recognized over the next 12 months.", "I'll comment on the effective tax rate before moving to investments. The effective tax rate was 37.5% in 2007 compared to 37.2% last year. For 2008, we expect the rate to be approximately the same as 2007 on a full-year basis.", "Capital expenditures include pre-publication investments and purchases of property and equipment. Pre-publication investments were $89 million in the fourth quarter and $299 million for the year. The full-year investment is slightly less than our guidance due to timing and operating efficiencies. For 2008, we project that pre-publication investments will be about $300 to $310 million. This reflects the necessary investments to take advantage of strong adoption opportunities.", "Purchases of property and equipment were $83.2 million in the fourth quarter. It was about $230 million for 2007, which compares to $127 million in 2006. This came in slightly lower than our recent forecast of $250 million.", "The increase versus 2006 is driven by technology investments we're making to digitize our products and services and the investment for the construction of our new data center. The migration of our applications will begin in April, and will take approximately one year to complete. As I mentioned on the third quarter call, in 2008 each of our segments will incur migration costs. We have now sized that effort and total costs are expected to be in the range of $40 million.", "We project capital expenditures to approximate $170 million for 2008. In addition to normal replacement expenditures, this reflects additional purchases of software and technology equipment for the new data center in the first half of 2008, as well as continued technology investments for the creation of new and enhanced products and services as well as the final stages of the completion of the data center construction.", "Now for our non-cash items.", "Amortization of pre-publication costs was $240 million for 2007, slightly less than the $250 million projected. It was $45 million in the fourth quarter. As I discussed a few minutes ago, for 2008 we expect amortization to increase $45\u00a0million or 19% to $285 million.", "Depreciation was $113 million for 2007. It was $29 million for the fourth quarter. We expect depreciation to grow to $125 million in 2008, reflecting the completion of the data center, the purchase of new technology equipment for the center, and other capital expenditure increases in property and equipment.", "Amortization of intangibles was $48 million for 2007. It was $14 million in the fourth quarter. For 2008, we expect approximately $52 million.", "That brings me to free cash flow. In defining free cash flow we start with operating cash flow and reduce that amount by certain cash outflows for investing and financing activities that are recurring by nature. As you can see from the table, cash provided by operations per U.S. GAAP was $1.7\u00a0billion for 2007. We then subtract the following, which we have already described:  investments in pre-publication costs of $299 million, purchases of property and equipment, $230, additions to technology projects, $17 million, and dividends paid to our shareholders, $277.7 million.", "Under this definition, free cash flow for 2007 was about $900 million versus $825\u00a0million in 2006. We achieved this record free cash flow despite increased investments as a result of strong operating results and favorable changes in working capital.", "For 2008, we anticipate free cash flow the range of $850 to $900 million, which is about equal to 2007. This guidance reflects lower net income, continued investments, prudent management of working capital, and cash outflow for 2007 restructuring actions which will be largely offset by savings from these actions.", "Now, thank you and back to Terry.", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Okay. Thank you very much, Bob.", "Now obviously, we're pleased with the 22.5% EPS growth for 2007, albeit the slowdown in the U.S. structured finance market in particular in the fourth quarter.", "For 2008, it's going to be a first half, second half situation. The first half obviously is going to be slower, the second half picking up. But by the end of the full year, we're projecting EPS growth of 3% to 5% for the year.", "From an economy standpoint, it's very similar. We see a recession or recession-like environment in the first half improving in the second half. The housing recession will start to come to a conclusion. New housing starts will probably bottom out somewhere in the spring; a little bit more to go on housing prices to the fall as the equilibrium in terms of supply and demand of existing home sales works itself through, but a much better situation for the second half.", "So with that, let me turn it back to Don and then we'll go to anywhere you would like to go.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Donald Rubin - SVP, IR", "Thank you, Terry.", "Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. Please press star one to indicate you wish to enter the queue to ask a question. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press star two.", "If you've been listening through a speaker phone but would now like to ask a question, we ask that you lift your handset prior to pressing star one and remain on the handset until your question has been answered. That'll ensure good sound quality for everyone.", "I think we're now ready for the first question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Michael Meltz with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "Great. Thank you. I think I have two questions.", "Can you talk a little bit about your assumptions for S&P for the year? I think your slide said slower growth in the first half. Are you actually expecting revenue growth, S&P revenue to grow in the first half is my first question. And then related to that, what are you actually seeing thus far early in the year, in the first quarter here?", "And then second, Bob, on the shares out - the interest expense assumption of $80 to $100 million, how much buyback is in that number, and what does that imply for shares out?", "Thank you.", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Thanks, Michael.", "Again, the first half, second half issue for S&P and especially for ratings, the first half is going to be down versus the first half of 2007, picking up in the second half and finishing on a stronger footing there.", "But again, at this point and in terms of looking at the first quarter, the situation that we saw in November and December is pretty much repeating itself in January. We are seeing there's some but not much. ", "In terms of CDOs, residential mortgage-backed securities and the commercial mortgage-backed market, which we do expect to see some improvement in, still are very quiet on that part. And I think that reflects the current environment across the board for most people.", "As far as the share buyback, Bob?", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "Terry, if I could just add to that point, and then I'll get to the share buyback, Michael, with regard to our first half, second half forecast with regard to new issuance volumes, clearly there's significant differences here.", "When we look at structured finance on the U.S. side\u00a0\u00a0CMBS, CDOs, RMBS\u00a0 all were anticipated down in the range of 60% to 70%, thereabouts. Asset backs down but not anywhere to that level.", "But somewhat of a rebound in the second half of the year, one in anticipation of simply a better economic environment, but also better comparables. CMBS could be soft pretty much for the full year.", "Europe, down in the first half of the year, those same key categories that I mentioned, but not at the same rates and coming back a little bit better.", "On the corporates and government side, pretty much a little bit down in the first half of the year - corporates and financials - but up in the second half.", "Europe, we're expecting corporates and financials down in the first half, up in the second half. ", "That gives you some picture in terms of what we were thinking as we were building our plan.", "Now with regard to share buyback, clearly when we have our discussions with the Board, we tend to talk about our strategies on an annual basis, both for the dividend and for our share buybacks.", "As you know, the Board did authorize us to repurchase the full 35 million shares back in October, where we repurchased 7 million shares. ", "But just as a matter of policy, we go back and talk to the Board about the specific amounts of authorization. And of course, given the tighter economic outlook, we have a picture in mind and obviously that's being reflected in the interest item, but I don't necessarily want to say exactly how much now until we get the authorization levels from the Board.", "But clearly, the share buyback program is a very important element to us. It's reflected in our outlook for the year in terms of interest and naturally in our lower shares outstanding as we're factoring in our figures for 2008, but we'll be in a better position following the January Board meeting to be very specific about that.", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "Okay. On your point about S&P in the first half, the Q4 trend is down about 7%. Is it fair to say you think it will be a little bit weaker than that in the early part of this year?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "The Q4, the trend is - I mean directionally, it's in that same direction. The larger volume declines that we saw in RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and such will continue, but as you could also see from the attachments in the press release, we had very strong growth in the information products that, for the first time, as you can see, are broken out. And we expect that trend to continue so they will, because of the breadth of the portfolio that we have, will mute the overall decline. ", "But clearly, it's going to be a very tough first half of the year.", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and last question. In the quarter, what was the foreign exchange benefit at S&P? You have the annual in there.", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yeah. I think it was about 1 percent point of gross approximately. Yeah, on the revenue side, it contributed about 1%. ", "Michael Meltz - Bear Stearns", "Okay. All right. Thank you for your time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Fred Searby with JP Morgan.", "Fred Searby - JP Morgan", "Thank you, Terry and Bob, Don.", "A question on the Education margins that I thought your guidance was very positive in light of what's been going on, except the Education margin kind of surprised me. You've been guiding obviously for an improvement and now you're saying the investment in digital - what are EBITDA margins so if we back out the pre-pub amortization, what would that core margin be before amortization? ", "And where do you think you stand? I mean, if digital's only going to increase so does this put in jeopardy your longstanding goal of getting to 20% operating margins by 2010 in the Education business? Thanks.", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yeah, Fred, first of all, one of the things that we've been watching very carefully is the whole digital transformation component, and that in light of the ramp up in demand in terms of the new state adoption market.", "We made the decision to invest a little bit heavier, hence the pre-publication costs going up to make sure that we're in a good position for the 2009-2010 marketplace.", "The additional technology investment associated with that is part of it. We're also being very cautious at this point, too, in terms of the overall environment at this point. We have a very strong position, and we want to make sure that our market share gains are solid on that part, and we're watching very carefully state behavior as well.", "My sense of the state behavior question has to do with the fact that in terms of overall school budgets, it's the construction side that going to be more problematic than the content side because the results associated with student achievement are still the priority in getting that.", "Bob, do you want to add?", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "Yeah, just two points. ", "One, as I mentioned in my remarks that because of where we are right now, we do not expect to achieve the 20% margin in 2010, so I just want to emphasize that point.", "With regard to our margins, first of all, on operating profit for the year, when you exclude the restructuring activities and such we came in at 15.4%. This is on operating profit now compared to 13.8% last year. ", "If you look at it excluding the amortization of pre-pub on that modified EBITDA multiple that you're thinking of, it's around 20%.", "But clearly the investments that we have been making over the past few years, because of the big opportunities we're seeing - which includes [inaudible] investments as well - is coming through in terms of higher amortization on an annualized basis. So that's certainly impacting our performance.", "As you know, in that first year of an adoption - and of course last year, as Terry pointed out, we had the market-leading 32% share - that first year of an adoption has the biggest impact on the bottom line because one, your amortization - and we used some of the [digital] amortization - is highest in Year 1. In addition, you have a higher level of complimentary copies to promote your products, and there's also the pressures of free with order. So that very first year has a number of additional cost elements that, once you secure that order, hopefully will dissipate during the course of the remaining years.", "As a rule of thumb, you could use a replacement figure of around 10% in Years\u00a02, 3, 4, but Terry pointed out in his remarks some of the products that have higher level of consumables, the replacement amount might be a little bit higher. ", "So hopefully, that gives a little bit different color.", "Fred Searby - JP Morgan", "That helps. Can I have just one follow-up question on what I was saying? ", "Terry, historically you have positioned the digital transformation as a great opportunity and that it was going to reinvigorate the Education business and make it a growth business. In the near term it looks like it's just depressing margins, so do you think this is a temporary kind of transition and you'll start to see better revenue growth or better profitability beyond this transitional period?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yeah. Fred, I mean, without question. I mean, we're seeing it in a big way at the higher ed level and certainly in the professional markets.", "The digital transformation in the K-12 space has been a lot slower than we anticipated, but we're starting to see more and more signs that that's afoot and that there is going to be more change.", "So there's no question in my mind that when you start talking about customization, you start talking about individual instruction, you start talking about ways to improve broad-based student achievement, it has to come in the online environment. ", "And so we're very excited about that. We're going to continue to invest on that, and I think and hopefully we will start to see more results in the marketplace as that transition takes place.", "Fred Searby - JP Morgan", "Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Terry or Bob, are you getting any indications back from your sales guys in the field on the education side that deferrals are in the works in terms of adoptions in the 08 cycle?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Peter, no, we're not. I just came from a sales convention, and they are extremely upbeat and the opportunities for this year are very significant, as you know, with Texas, California and Florida all participating. ", "And we're excited about that, and we hopefully will have a record at the end of the year in terms of market share that is on the 2007 level.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Right. So in Texas specifically, where there have been issues in the past, the funding looks relatively secure?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yes, it does, on that one.", "Now again, there's noise factors here. We've all heard the noise from the governor in California and elsewhere, whatever, but again, my other prior comment. Usually in a more temporary kind of situation, you're going to see more cutbacks if there are cutbacks on the construction side rather than the content side because that's where they're going to be able to get the results in terms of the student achievement goals that they have.", "Now, another interesting one is that - and Bob alluded to this in talking about first half, second half ratings revenue - we're seeing some pretty good strength in the public finance market. And my sense of it is that given the fact that we have a recession-like environment as a mild and a brief issue with an uptick in the second half of the year, that what you might see is more states taking care of any gap that may exist in tax receipts through debt financing. [inaudible]", "So we're watching that one very carefully as well, but at this point we're excited about 2008 and the state adoption market and we like our opportunities.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then not to beat this too hard but on the 20% margin target, should we assume that that is sort of off the table permanently or do you think that is a realistic objective still on a longer-term basis? And I guess the issue, following on what Fred had said, is there just a permanent diminution in profitability in this business in the context of the higher spending levels you're required to make to remain competitive?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "No. I think it is a more temporary situation, and I think that the digital transformation, especially in the K-12 space, is taking a little longer to get adopted into the marketplace. And there's several reasons for that, but it's not because of the fact that it's not going to be a stronger part of what curriculum is all about in the education space.", "On the margin goals, Peter, absolutely not. I mean, we still have very much thinking here of getting to the 20%, and as you know that in the digital transformed environment, given some of the costs that go away, we're looking for even more than that. But we've got to get to 20 on that part, and that is the mantra here.", "And as Bob was saying, we think that given some of these increased investments, getting there by 2010 is not realistic so we want to say that, but that is very much the goal that we have in mind, and we're going to do everything we possibly can to continue to improve those margins.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "All right. Okay, great. Thank you.", "And last thing, Bob, are you comfortable taking the leverage ratios up from where they are currently, factoring in the seasonal CP you'll take on to fund repurchases or other activities, or should we assume the repurchases in '08 have to be primarily funded from internal free cash flow.", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "I think there'll be more of a timing thing there, Peter, than anything else.", "As you know, the first half of the year - just from normal operations, it's the lighter part of the year - we're making more off our investments. So, like peak to trough, you can think of roughly $150 million is the variability between first half, second half with regard to our cash needs.", "But I think what you'll see is most likely the repurchase program will be spread across the year, so we'll simply be building up the CP program and then paying it down during the second half of the year. That's the expectation that we have right now.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "Which would imply that year-end debt will be similar '08 to '07.", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "It will be in that similar range, yeah.", "Peter Appert - Goldman Sachs", "All right. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Lucas Binder with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Lucas Binder - UBS", "Hi, guys. Thank you very much. A couple of quick questions.", "On the slides you talk about the decline in revenue, and Terry, you highlighted how issuance, global issuance, is down, but revenues were not down as much.", "Can you talk about how that works? How is that, for instance, international revenues were down 4% or 5% in the fourth quarter, but issuance was down quite a bit more than that? What are the different contributing factors to that, and is that a way to look at it going into 2008, especially with deferred revenue contributing?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "That's exactly right. ", "Bob, go ahead.", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "Yeah, why don't I jump in here? There's several components when you look at the overall performance. ", "First of all we have the high level or relationship fees, surveillance fees. Then we have our data products, that being Rating Express, Ratings Direct, which are very nice products and they're growing rather rapidly. ", "The $790 million relating to deferred revenue, which has grown 10% during 2007, we expect to grow modestly in 2008, but nevertheless we're expecting growth so these are elements that offset the transaction nature that you're looking at.", "So the issuance numbers would be more reflective in large part to the transaction side, but there are recurring revenue streams and there are the non-traditional, non-transaction revenues that also counterweight that.", "When you look at total Financial Services, roughly 25% or thereabouts relates to information-based products, and you could see from Slide 4 on the press release, they were growing double digit and we expect very significant growth going out into 2008.", "So I think all these are contributing factors to our overall performance.", "Lucas Binder - UBS", "The final question, then, would be if we see issuance down substantially in 2008, could the impact to deferred revenue be more a 2009-2010 phenomenon? Or is it like you said, that's going to continue to grow at a more modest pace, but still grow?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Where we expect the issuance figures to decline more rapidly would be in the structured areas - RMBS, CMBS, CDOs, et cetera. ", "The main contributor, the larger contributor, to the deferred revenue side would be in corporates, financial institutions, public finance, that side of the house. ", "So we don't see a similar decline in deferred revenue as you might see in issuance volumes.", "Lucas Binder - UBS", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, good morning. Thank you.", "On this up 2% to 4% Financial Service revenue guidance for the year, obviously to build up to that you had to think about how you thought the quarters were going to progress.", "What I'm curious about is you talk about January being down similar in terms of the new issued dollar volume down in January similar to November and December.", "It sounds like then that you're assuming first quarter revenue from Financial Services down worse than roughly the 7% number you had in the fourth quarter. Is that fair?", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "I'm not - no, we're not necessarily projecting and we're not going to project revenue by quarter because that's obviously much more difficult. ", "But I think the important element here is that the issuance volumes that we saw in terms of the rather significant declines in the fourth quarter are continuing into the first quarter, and whether that continues out into the second quarter, we're not sure. Because clearly the visibility is not like it had been in the past. Things are very different.", "But on the other hand, we do have those other elements of revenue that I just mentioned that will continue - relationship revenues that we'll be recognizing, surveillance fees, contract revenue relating to ratings, express ratings, direct products, like that. And then you get into the information products that, again, we expect to grow in the double-digit category during the course of the year.", "So to be precise in terms of where the revenue decline overall will be is a little bit difficult at this point in time, but nevertheless, I think the patterns are somewhat similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter.", "But we're not going to be projecting quarterly revenue guidance. We really want to look at first half, second half.", "Hopefully that gives you some help here.", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yeah. And Craig I think that, again, we've got, as Bob says, a fair bit of uncertainty as to how some of these instruments are going to return or where some of the categories of investment pickup is going to come from. ", "In the meantime, we're going to be obviously bears on cost, and we are going to be able to be in this position, I think, to benefit when this starts to come back.", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "In talking about costs on the Financial Services side, do you have any plans to do another restructuring charge, perhaps later in the spring if things don't materialize as you expect to face the next four or five months?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Craig, the restructuring charge we took was a second tier step compared to the cost controls we put into place in the fourth quarter of 2007. We believe that relative to the revenue projections we have, that is a very good response to that.", "Given the uncertainty down the pike, that would be all hypothetical, but we'll do whatever it takes to be able to make sure that our cost structure is equivalent to the revenue generation capabilities we have.", "So we're going to - we continue to look at this every day and all of that.", "But in this kind of environment, you've got to make sure that you're doing everything you possibly can to watch that expense base. But we'll be watching the revenue projection side very hard, too, as well.", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "And then lastly if I could, on the Education front here, if we are in a recession or we go into recession here over the first, say, six to nine months this year, how confident are you that the elementary-high school, you know, overall Education revenues will be up 6% to 8% this year in that sort of environment?", "Or do you think it's actually - it just gets delayed with the fallout in tax revenues and it therefore actually hurts 2009 Education numbers as opposed to this year?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Craig, when we make our revenue projections like this, we take into account the environment that we're going to be in. Again, any special event or event risk factor that could take place we'll be watching very hard.", "But again, remember in terms of overall school budgets, which have to do with construction, with teachers, with materials, all of those kind of factors, the area that usually gets affected in the short term is the construction side.", "Again, governors are measured on their student achievement scores, and therefore content is usually the last thing to be cut.", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "But again, would you be more nervous about 2009, then, on the Education revenue side as opposed to 2008, then, having said that?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Everything that we've talked about in terms of - and we're talking K12 now - in the marketplace, 2009, 2010, and really 2011 if you take into account Texas, are going to be very good years for us. The opportunities are going to be there, and we're gearing up now for those markets. As you know, two, three years out, we're developing the products on that. ", "So no, we feel very good about that.", "Craig Huber - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Choi with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning. I have two questions.", "First, I want just to go back to the S&P assumption. Since ratings were still around 74% of your total segment revenues for the year, even if I assume 15%, 20% growth for the Investment Services, that seems to imply that you think ratings will be basically flat to down, maybe 5% for the whole year. And that seems to imply pretty significant recovery in the second half.", "Just want to sort of check that assumption and my interpretation and see if there's anything - if that's sort of in line with what you're thinking.", "And I guess the second question is similar. In terms of Education, given your outlook for industry growth, you seem to be implying a 6% to 8% growth will be quite a bit higher than the industry growth. Is it just coming from market share gains, or is it going to be made up from growth in international or professional?", "If you can give some more color, that'd be great.", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "All right. On the S&P ratings side, as Bob said, the first half of this year is going to be down. This is where diversity counts. And all of the other factors, the nontraditional ratings, all of the other information and content services are going to be a player here.", "In addition, as I was talking in my remarks, the S&P Investment Services, which is now 26% of total Financial Services revenue, is also scheduled for some good growth here as well.", "But there is no question that the U.S. structured finance market in particular is hard hit, and you can go to your own desk and you can see the level of activity - it's not very high on that one.", "Will that come back quickly? Will that come back - I don't know. ", "At this point, our best thinking is that we're going to start to see growth again towards the second half of this year, and we're going to benefit from that. We're going to position ourselves to do that, but it's going to be a tougher first half in terms of ratings revenue, and therefore revenue will be coming from other sources.", "Bob?", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "Yeah, I think the ratings forecast that you said, around flat or thereabouts, is a reasonable projection for the year where we are.", "The first half of the year, clearly much weaker, but when we get into the second half of the year, two elements. One, we're anticipating somewhat of a recovery in terms of whether we're in a recession, a mild one but at least starting a bouncing back. But again, the comparables as well will be much better for us going into the second half of the year.", "So weighted for the full year, a weak first half; a better situation for the second half for the two reasons I said. But overall, around flat. ", "But that's a reasonable place to look at the ratings side, and we're expecting growth from the information products, as Terry mentioned.", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "And on Education?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "I'm sorry, what was that one, Karl?", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Sure. Given your outlook for industry growth for el-high, 4 to 5 for college in the U.S. and 3 to 4 in your overall growth for the segment of 68. Just want to see where the discrepancy comes in. Is it purely from market share gains that you're expecting or from the other businesses within the segment such as professional and international?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, it is clearly going to be from good execution and good performance.", "Again, we were very pleased with the 32% market share that we took this year. We're looking for further gains in terms of market share support. We're also looking at a strong higher education market, and we anticipate to do better than the industry averages there as well.", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Is testing included in your 3% to 4% - sorry, in your 4% to 5% growth estimate for the industry for El-High?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "No. ", "Karl Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Catriona Fallon - Citi. Please go ahead.", "Catriona Fallon - Citigroup", "\t", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. ", "So specifically I'm looking at the levers that you have to pull to get your S&P guidance of operating margin down 125 to 225 basis points, so specifically what kind of variability is there in incentive compensation within the S&P - what percentage of expenses there are compensation, and of that, how much of that is an incentive or a variable comp?", "And then secondly, about pricing power, what type of pricing power do you have on new issuance? Is there any movement there?", "And then on your relationship-based revenue, how do those relationships change on an annual basis? Is it typically a flat fee or is there some movement there based on size of company or expected debt issuance, et cetera?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, number one, when we start talking about - and you're focused on the ratings side of S&P - it's for the most part all people costs. And certainly the incentive, part of that is part of this and it's affected on that part. ", "And I'll let Bob - you want to comment on that?", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "Yeah. There's a couple elements within the incentive programs. We have multiple incentive programs within ratings. Some of those programs are clearly performance-based programs, and others are sort of like a quasi-performance, profit sharing. You could think of it in that regard. So there are variable elements to it, and there's also more of a steady state side of it.", "As we look at our overall - and not to go into the specifics, but nevertheless in our factoring of where we're going to be for the year and the outlook for the first half, second half, et cetera, we've factored in those various components into our equation.", "As Terry pointed out, we took certain actions in the fourth quarter with the announcement. There's also been a significant amount of staffing delays and nonhirings of positions that have been on the Board but simply have not been filled and we'll be receiving those benefits throughout the course of the year.", "So those are some very significant elements that I think will help to contribute to our projection of a decline of 125 to 225 basis points.", "But you also have the other side of the house, the information products and services that are going to be growing really well. Margins have been improving on that side. The margin contribution is different clearly between ratings and nonratings, but nevertheless, the margins have been steadily improving over the past couple of years.", "With regard to pricing power, clearly there's limited pricing power as we're moving into this particular year. ", "And the relationship fee side, there's several elements there, but the relationship fees are negotiated at the beginning of each year with the major issuers. It's based on the expectation of issuance going out into the next year, the size of those issuance and such, and the relationship fee structure that existed in the previous year.", "I think what we'll see is probably in a lot of cases flat projections with regard to our relationship fees, and in some cases for some of the perhaps financial institutions that have been focusing more on improving their capital structure by equity than anything else, we might see some fee renegotiations. But we've factored that into our thinking.", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "I would also mention the fact that over 40% now of [inaudible] revenue is coming from outside the United States. ", "And here, where the opportunities are, as I mentioned, you know, we are investing in those opportunities - the new offices in Johannesburg and Tel Aviv and Dubai - and also the new operations in Turkey are also representing opportunities.", "But the structured finance market in Europe and in Asia is behaving somewhat differently than it is here. The large problem is the U.S. structured finance market, so in terms of some of that growth, we're going to benefit from that. ", "But as Bob said, there's very little variability in the prices in the relationship part. Those are pretty constant.", "The issue in terms of pricing, obviously it's higher when you're talking about larger, more complex instruments like CDOs and RMBS and CMBS and the like, and so with more growth coming from the corporate side and the government side, we'll be looking at that as well.", "Catriona Fallon - Citigroup", "Great. Thank you.", "And just kind of a broad picture question, then, on your view on the federal funds rate cuts, and what type of improvement in liquidity do you think we'll see in the next month or so following the recent cuts? ", "And is there any sensitivity around how quickly the financial services have reacted in your experience or rebounded in relation to the pace of additional cuts? Like would that give a change to your outlook at all if rate cuts come quicker than what you said in March or April?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yeah. Well, first of all and again, our sense of this - and David Wyss, our Chief Economist, said and he's very much on top of this - our feeling was that the 75\u00a0basis point move was extraordinary, and that there are going to be further moves.", "The thinking that we had prior to the 75 point move was that there was going to be movement in January, there'd be a rate cut in March, and there'd be a rate cut in April, and we'd be down to 3.5% in April.", "Well, we're at 3.5% now, and clearly, in terms of dealing with liquidity, the monetary policy is the best stimulus package, and we're going to probably see more cuts.", "David Wyss thinks that when all is said and done, we're going to be down to a 2.5% fed funds rate. So that would give us a full percentage point to go, and my guess is that we're going to see it sooner rather than later on that part.", "As far as a stimulus package, the president's plan was $145 billion. Democrats were talking about even going higher, to $200 billion, in terms of some of the pushback, and the president has not disagreed with that.", "The question is how quickly are you going to be able to get it out, and my guess is that they're going to do everything they possibly can to do it in the next several months.", "Catriona Fallon - Citigroup", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Atorino with Benchmark. Please go ahead.", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Co.", "Hi. Bob, could you - Peter's question on the debt, you're raising your interest expense dramatically, but did I understand you're going to end up the year with the same debt you have now? It doesn't quite equate. ", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "Well, Peter, we issued our senior notes - as I mentioned earlier, we ended 2006, entering 2007, with no debt, so during the course of the year, as we repurchased shares, we only began to build debt. ", "We got ourselves up to a level of about $1.2 billion really by the end of the third quarter, where we converted that commercial paper - which was commercial paper outstanding - into the senior notes - 5s, 10s, 30, $1.2 billion - so there was a build up of debt during the course of the year.", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Co.", "Okay, yeah.", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "We will have that debt outstanding for the balance of 2008.", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Co.", "Gotcha. Okay. ", "Robert Bahash - CFO", "In addition, we will be using our leverage with regard to commercial paper to one, fund our working capital needs - and there will be an anticipation of share repurchases as well, not being specific in terms of how much until we have that meeting with the Board - so there's a partial year in 2007 and a full-year impact in 2008.", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Co.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Silver with RBS Greenwich Capital. Please go ahead.", "Ken Silver - RBS Greenwich Capital", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call.", "A couple questions about your higher education business. Can you just maybe give more color as to why the - hello?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Ken, are you there?", "Ken Silver - RBS Greenwich Capital", "Yeah, can you hear me?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yeah. Go ahead.", "Ken Silver - RBS Greenwich Capital", "On higher education, why was revenue growth in the fourth quarter - I think it was 3.4% - why was that so much lower than the rest of the year, which was 7% and, you know, the third quarter, which was 8%?", "And then the other question I had was if I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks you were only expecting revenue growth in the domestic higher education market to be 3% to 4% next year, which I think is quite a bit lower than '07. ", "If you could just talk about those two things?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yeah. First of all, from a timing standpoint, the seasonality of the higher ed flows would, if you've got as strong a third quarter as we did, you're probably pulling some timing issues out of the fourth quarter, and that was the case here.", "Also international was a little softer than we had anticipated. And usually the flow back from international operations would take place in the fourth quarter, and that was that effect.", "But we were very pleased with the higher ed performance, and clearly it's a very strong third quarter business and less so in the fourth.", "Ken Silver - RBS Greenwich Capital", "Okay. And then the forecast for the industry only to grow 3% to 4% next year? I mean, that's lower than in '07, right?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yeah, it is. Again, that's the best guess that we have at this point from what we're seeing in terms of the market activity.", "We fully expect, as we indicated, that we're going to do better now.", "Ken Silver - RBS Greenwich Capital", "But could you just give us more color as to why? I mean, I think it was 5% to 6% at least, and you were up 7% this year. Why do you think it's going to be so much weaker next year? What are you hearing?", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, it's not such much what I'm hearing. I mean, in terms of the kinds of programs that we're dealing with and the projections that we make, it's coming in more like 3%, 4%. So it is a market projection rather than any particular factor.", "Again, we look at that. But from the markets that we are going to participate in and the programs that we have, those titles look to us to be a lot more exciting in terms of their promises or prospects than the market.", "Ken Silver - RBS Greenwich Capital", "Any in particular that you think are - which programs, I mean.", "Harold McGraw III - Chairman, President and CEO", "Oh, straight across the board. Our Economics in Business segment is doing exceptionally well. The humanities areas, languages are going to do very well.", "But no, we're very - we think we have really good programs and they're in the right places, and we expect to participate. ", "Ken Silver - RBS Greenwich Capital", "Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you, and I show no further questions at this time.", "That does conclude today's morning conference call.

", "Today's update will last approximately an hour.  After our presentations we will open the meeting to questions and answers.   It's now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Okay, thank you very much Don and good morning everyone and again thank you for taking the time to be with us today for the review of the McGraw-Hill Companies\u2019 first quarter earnings and our outlook for 2008.  As Don was saying, joining me on the conference call besides Don Rubin is Bob Bahash, our Exec Vice President and CFO and also Deven Sharma, the head of our financial service segment, President of Standard & Poor\u2019s.  ", "I\u2019ll begin the call by reviewing first our first quarter results and some prospects for 2008.  Bob will then review our financing performance and obviously after that we will go in any direction that you would like, any comments or questions that you have.  Earlier this morning we released our first quarter results.  Earnings per share were $0.25 compared to $0.40 last year.  And remember now that that $0.40 included a $0.03 gain on the divestiture of a mutual fund data business.  ", "Revenue for the first quarter declined 6.1% to $1.2 billion.  The slumping housing market remains the major negative factor for both the economy and the financial markets and clearly the credit crunch in the financial markets had an impact on our first quarter results.  Continued financial sector problems are expected to convince the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates tomorrow by probably 25 basis points.  The Fed\u2019s fund rate is currently obviously at 2.25%.  ", "David Weiss the Chief Economist at Standard & Poor\u2019s says the first half of 2008 will be the toughest period for the economy and expecting the second half of the year to show some strength.  He expects the tax rebate to help produce GDP growth of about 2.5% in the third quarter, maybe more.  And the business tax credits will provide a boost in the fourth quarter.  With that as background, let\u2019s take a look at our first quarter performance and review our prospects for the balance of the year and let\u2019s begin with McGraw-Hill Education.  ", "Revenue declined 0.5%, we reduced the operating loss by 0.5%, the operating margin was unchanged from a year ago.  And revenue for the McGraw-Hill school education group declined 4.8% to $138.8 million and revenue for the McGraw-Hill higher education, professional and international group grew 2.9% to $191.4 million.  First quarter results don\u2019t indicate much about what\u2019s ahead for our education business this year and a seasonally very low comparison.  ", "Obviously we run losses in the first quarter and you make your money in the third quarter.  In the elementary and high school market, first quarter revenue depends more on purchases of fill in copies and supplemental materials more than on new business.  In higher education, first quarter revenue is primarily driven by ordering for the start of the new term, on echo of the ordering established during the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter.  ", "But at the same time, we begin to get reports from the field on how our new products are being received in the marketplace.  It is still early, but we are encouraged by the preliminary reports and our confidence in our forecast for the year is growing.  Although North Carolina was the only adoption state to place substantial orders for newly adopted basal materials in the first quarter, we think the state new adoption market will meet our expectations by growing 10-15% this year.  In 2007, the state new adoption market was approximately $820 million.  ", "Our estimate for this market in 2008 is $900-$950 million.  We still expect year over year industry revenue growth of about 1-2% in the open territory.  Again that\u2019s a wild card for us, we think that after the last two years of it being fairly slow, that we might see some pickup there.  We also look for 4-5% growth across the elementary high school market as a whole.  In 2008, the McGraw-Hill school education group is focused on major opportunities in elementary reading and math and on three big adoption states, Florida, Texas and California.  ", "In the Florida K-5 reading adoption we are getting very encouraging reports on the performance of Treasures, which is our balanced basal reading program, our alternative basal which is called Imagine-It, which is a revision of our open court reading and also a direct instruction program called Reading Mastery.  In the Texas K-5 math adoption our new state specific program is off to a very solid start.  In California we have sales opportunities in first year math and second year science.  ", "Our state specific programs are competitive in both subjects at both the elementary and secondary levels.  And our alternative basal which is called Everyday Mathematics also looks very strong in California.  We also like our opportunities in K-5 reading in Oklahoma and Louisiana, our 6-12 literature in Alabama, Louisiana and Oklahoma, our 6-12 science program in Georgia and in Kentucky and our 6-12 social studies in Arkansas and Tennessee.  Prospects also look very good for our fine arts, health, business and vocational lines in states adopting those subjects this year.  ", "Decision making in the open territory typically continues through the end of the second quarter and sometimes beyond.  But we\u2019re encouraged by the opportunities our field staff has been tracking for this year and we\u2019ll have m ore to give you on that in the next couple months.  We expect to benefit from the introduction of Math Connects which is our new national program for the K-5 market and Time Links, a new K-5 social studies program.  We also anticipate continued gains in open territory market share for Treasures, the elementary reading program that we\u2019ve launched with great success last year.  ", "In the supplemental market, there is a diminishing demand for traditional stand-alone products.  Typically these products are not clearly correlated to state standards or are supported by research studies, criteria that are increasingly important in this age of accountability.  And many supplements that used to be purchased separately are now unnecessary because similar materials are provided in the ancillary packages that accompany today\u2019s more comprehensive basal programs.  ", "But sales are growing for our new print and digital intervention products which have been constructed around state standards and validated through research.  In testing, we anticipate the strengthening of new revenue stream as formative assessment becomes more and more important in the instructional process.  The introduction of Acuity, our new formative testing system has enabled us to establish leadership in this market in a very short timeframe.  ", "In 2007, Acuity was selected for New York City\u2019s period assessment program which is the largest formative contract ever awarded at $80 million over five years.  Acuity has been expanding its customer base at the school district level, elsewhere in New York and many other states.  The system has also been adopted on a statewide basis in Indiana and in West Virginia.  Clearly activity is brisk despite concerns about the impact of a weakening economy on state and local budgets.  Budgets are now under construction in 46 states that start their new fiscal year on July 1.  ", "In March, Standard & Poor\u2019s issued a report on how a weak economy will tax US state\u2019s 2009 budgets.  S&P pointed out that the budget proposals are showing substantial and broad based reductions in spending for most expense categories, except for education.  In fact, the record of state support for education in this decade is remarkably consistent.  According to statistics from a national association of state budget officers report, funding for education, aggregated across all 50 states has increased every year since 2001.  Clearly, education remains a priority for all state government.  ", "We will continue to monitor the situation obviously very carefully but for now it appears that the concern over state funding for education may be exaggerated.  The weakening economy could also benefit the college and university market.  As this chart shows, there is a counter-cyclical aspect of the US higher education market.  In this decade, annual enrollments continued to grow as economic growth declined.  In difficult times, more students stay in school longer while others return for more education to enhance their employability in a changing market.  ", "Even without the stimulus of a slowing economy, college enrollments are expected to climb over the next decade based on demographic trends.  The fastest growth will occur among women and members of minority groups according to a recent report from the US Department of Education\u2019s National Center for Educational Statistics.  We expect the US college and university markets to grow in the range of 3-4% this year and we still expect to outperform the market.  ", "So let\u2019s sum up for the outlook of McGraw-Hill Education.  Growing confident n the forecast for industry growth in el-high and higher education market, segment revenue growth of 6-8% and operating margin will probably decline 50-100 basis points due to stepped up investments in technology due to the acceleration of improvements towards the digital transformation.  Okay, with that, let\u2019s go to the financial services segment.  ", "Here product and geographic diversity and cost containment helped cushion a steep decline in the structured finance area at financial services.  In the first quarter, revenue declined 11.6%, operating profit was down 25.3% and the operating margin was 40.4% down from 47.7% for the same period last year, but better than the 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 07 when restructuring charges cost 2.5% points on the margin.  In this environment, cost containment is clearly the top priority.  ", "We had the benefit of restructuring from the fourth quarter last year and we will see the full impact of that action starting in the second quarter of this year.  We strictly limited hiring, we cut back on discretionary expenses and we reduced 2008 incentive compensation.  We actually reduced year over year costs in the first quarter at financial services and in just a moment, Bob Bahash will review those details for you.  In the face of challenging market conditions, we are currently considering more staff reductions.  We have taken a measured approach as we carefully assess the operating environment.  ", "At this point it is clear to me that we need to do more to lower cost and improve efficiency and we will have more to say about further reductions in the next several weeks, both at financial services and at McGrew-Hill Education.  We also continue to focus on how best to growth our financial services business so we\u2019re in a good position to resume growth once the market regains its stride as for sure it will.  Creating a diversified portfolio has long been a key strategic for us at financial services.  ", "The growth of Standard & Poor\u2019s investment services is a key element in our effort to diversify within financial services.  S&P investment services grew by 18% to $217 million in the first quarter and represented 34% of the segment\u2019s revenue.  We expect double digit revenue growth from this non-ratings business for the balance of the year.  Our efforts to diversify are not limited to S&P investment services.  For S&P credit market services there\u2019s an ongoing effort to diversify asset class, geography, product mix and through the growth of annual fee and subscription revenue.  ", "For the financial services segment, unearned revenue increased in the first quarter by 13.6% to $812 million or about 74% of the corporation\u2019s total deferred revenue for this period.  And we expect deferred revenue at financial services to continue growing this year.  It contributed to the 11.2% growth of non-transaction revenue at S&P credit market services which produced increases in subscriptions like Ratings Direct and Ratings Express annual fees and surveillance revenue.  ", "Revenue from non-transaction sources was $309.1 million in the first quarter.  International revenue for credit market services and that was driven by favorable foreign exchange, grew by 5.8% in the first quarter to $204.5 million or about 48% of the top line.  That\u2019s very encouraging and telling.  Crisil in India is an increasingly important contributor to our growth overseas and we continue to seek new opportunities to grow in international markets.", "In the first quarter we added a new rating agency in Israel, S&P Maalot and opened new branch operations in Dubai and Johannesburg, South Africa.  Our strategy clearly buffered the segment and S&P credit market services from the severity of the decline in the structured finance market in the first quarter.", "As this table shows, revenue for the financial services declined 11.6% and S&P credit market services was off 21.6% while global new issue dollar volume fell 49.3% in the first quarter.  S&P credit market services international revenue increased 5.8% in the first quarter while international new issue dollar volume declined by 42.9%.", "Domestic revenue for the credit market services declined by 36.6% while total US dollar volume fell by 55.5%.  We\u2019ve been charting the decline in the US new issue volume since the structured finance markets started falling in 2007.  As the orange bars in this slide shows, the decline in the fourth quarter of 2007 accelerated in the first quarter of 2008 led by the plunge in US structured finance new issue dollar volume which was down 69.4% in January, 84.7% in February and 74.8% in March. ", "We saw a similar pattern in the first quarter in the European structured finance market.  The downturn hit residential mortgage backed securities, the commercial mortgage backed securities and the collateralized debt obligations.  Only the dollar volume issuance of asset backed securities showed an increase in the first quarter in the United States and Europe.  Without one private placement of $29 billion, new issue dollar volume of asset backed securities in the US would have been down slightly.", "As a result of the steep decline in the new issue markets, the transaction revenue for S&P credit market services declined by 55.8% in the first quarter.  The outlook for financial services depends in part on the depth and the duration of the downturn in the structured finance market.  There\u2019s no question that there eventually will be a pickup in the structured finance market.", "It\u2019s a question of timing that hinges on when investors believe most risks are transparent and out in the open.  The slowdown in the US economy and the tightening of residential mortgage lending standards will impact the level of lending in residential markets.  In the commercial mortgage backed market, cash bond spreads will have to tighten considerably.  Forecasting CDO issuance remains difficult.", "In the asset backed securities market, the non-mortgage ABS pipeline remained very healthy.  Credit card issuance got off to a strong start in the first quarter.  Credit card asset backed securities have been an attractive form of funding for the banks and we expect that trend to continue as banks try to preserve liquidity.  ", "The student loans sector is currently under some pressure.  In the corporate market both here and in Europe, investment grade issuance continues to attract investors.  As a result, we\u2019ve seen corporate treasurers increase sales of long term investment grade bonds for the first time in a decade.  A shrinking commercial paper market and Federal Reserve rate cuts have helped the growth of investment grade bonds.", "A recovery in the high yield market rests clearly on the renewal of investor confidence.  In public finance, new money issuance comprised the bulk of that activity.  Slower economic growth and the weakening housing sector will affect state and local governments and could increase the demand for debt financing.  In the past economic slowdowns, we have seen a shift to bonds instead of pay as you go sources.", "At S&P investment services we will benefit from the growth of our data and information businesses.  Capital IQ continues to add new customers and they\u2019re now more than 2,300 which is a 24% increase compared to the first quarter last year.  Capital IQ continues to upgrade its product line.  Earlier this month its latest release included content for more than 3,500 non-traditional media sources and improved download capabilities and an improved charting functionality.", "Our index service business is still growing and expanding.  We saw more volume in exchange traded derivatives and a 23.1% year over year increase in assets under management in exchange traded funds based on S&PO indices.  Our data and custom index business also grew.  In the first quarter S&P indices were the basis of 13 new exchange traded funds.  There are now 157 exchange traded funds based on S&P indices and you can count on the fact that there is going to be more.", "We have a variety of new indices in the pipeline for introduction shortly.  Index services is amongst the fastest growing and most profitable at McGraw-Hill financial services.  To wrap up our review on financial service I will comment briefly on the regulatory and legal outlook.  A lot has been written and even more has been said about the current problems in the financial markets.  From the outset, S&P has been working to be a part of that solution.", "That\u2019s why in February of this year, S&P announced 27 leadership actions designed to strengthen the ratings process, increase transparency and enhance its independence.  S&P is focused on four key areas here, the categories are analytics, governance, information and education.  With analytics it\u2019s to ensure that ratings models, processes and analytical talent continue to be of the highest quality.", "In governance, to ensure transparency and maintain investor confidence. With information to provide more insight into the ratings process and greater clarity about the risk that could cause rating assumptions to change.  And with investor education, to help market participants understand what a credit rating is and what it is not.", "On April 10, S&P updated the market on the progress it is making in these key areas.  These range from adding requirements for additional loan level data from issuers for new RMBS deals to the formation of a risk oversight committee and instituting and analyst rotation program.  For a complete update, the best thing to do is to go to a website that we have put together here at www.spnewactions.com.  (Repeating URL) for a complete understanding of the 27 leadership actions that we\u2019ve taken.", "The senior management team has been active both here and abroad reviewing these initiatives with regulators, legislators and other policy makers.  The response to the S&P initiatives have been very positive.  In fact many of our leadership actions are reflected in some of the recommendations that are beginning to emerge on how credit rating agencies should manage their processes.", "This summer we expect the SEC to report on its ongoing examination of the rating agencies.  We also expect the SEC to propose some new oversight rules at that time as well.  We are committed to helping bring stability and transparency to capital markets and look forward to continuing our dialogue with regulators and policy makers, both here and importantly abroad as well.", "Based on what we know today, we do not believe any pending legal, governmental or self regulatory proceedings will result in a material adverse affect on our financial conditions or on the results of our operations.  So let\u2019s sum up for financial services.  We expect double digit growth for S&P investment services.  Obviously credit ratings market faces continued uncertainty, although there is some signs of encouragement and I think in the second half we will start to see more progress.  ", "But if the steep drop that we experienced in the first quarter in structured finance should continue for the rest of the year, revenue at financial services segment would decline 7-9% and we would also expect a 500-600 basis point contraction in the operating margin.  Now I must add that I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen but if that steep drop we experienced in the quarter should continue, then those results and I think would be prudent, even though it\u2019s a very conservative approach to take.", "Now let\u2019s review our information and media segment.  Let me just take a moment here, I\u2019ve just been informed that we understand that some people cannot see the slides.  We will be posting the slides immediately after this call on the investor relations website so that you can get them.  But I hope that you\u2019re able to see them.  ", "Again let\u2019s review now the information and media segment.  Growth in our information products and services again were key to the segment\u2019s improved result.  In the first quarter the revenue increased 3.2%, operating profit increased 18.6% and the operating margin improved to 4.8 from 4.2 last year.  At the business to business group, revenue increased 3.5% to $219.7 million.", "Our value added information for global markets is helping to produce the B to B growth.  Platts news and pricing services for oil, natural gas and power are all growing as volatile energy markets increase the demand for information.  Platts continues to grow faster overseas than in North America by attracting new customers from emerging markets, like the former Soviet Republic and the Middle East.", "J.D. Power & Associates has also been growing in international markets.  Last week it was reported that China has passed Japan as the world\u2019s second largest car market behind the United States.  That\u2019s good news for J.D. Power & Associates which began its voice of the customer research more than eight years ago.", "To take advantage of growing opportunities in China, J.D. Power in 2006 acquired Automotive Resources Asia, ARA, a leading source of market information and analysis for the Chinese market.  In 2007 the new capabilities enabled us to win a substantial contract focusing on sales and service process improvement for the Chinese auto dealers who want to establish a competitive advantage based on superior customer satisfaction.", "Last week, J.D. Power launched Power Circle Ratings on sina.com, the most recognized internet brand in China.  The Power Circle Ratings are designed to help Chinese consumers make more informed decisions when shopping for new vehicles.  To add to J.D. Power\u2019s research capabilities, we acquired in April a company called Umbria Inc.  This company which has pioneered in deriving market intelligence from online community adds an important new dimension to J.D. Power\u2019s voice of the customer research.", "Advertising is off to a slow start in the first quarter.  At Business Week ad pages for the global edition were down 19.4% in the first quarter and that\u2019s according to the publishers\u2019 information bureau.  Broadcasting revenue of $23.7 million for the first quarter was flat compared to the prior year.  Increases in political and local advertising were mostly offset by declines in national time sales.", "In our TV markets, the outlook for political advertising this year is very promising.  In the next eight months we will see three primary and national elections.  Statewide primaries will be held in Indiana on May 6 in California on June 3 and in Colorado on August 12.  State and local elections include a governor and a congressional seat in Indiana, the San Diego mayor and a congressional seat in California and a US Senate and House race in Colorado.", "So summing up for the information and media services, more global growth for our information products, promising outlook for political advertising later in the year, revenue growth of 6 [overlay] % for the segment and improvement in operating margins.", "Okay, that completes the review of the operations and therefore summing up for the corporation.  Year over year comparisons get easier in the second half in financial services, so we haven\u2019t ruled out the possibility of finishing 2008 on an upswing.  But again, if the current trends in the financial markets that we have seen in the first quarter of this year should continued for the balance of the year, then we would expect earnings per share in the $2.65-$2.75 range in 2008.", "And again, you know, I personally don\u2019t think that will take place but I don\u2019t think given the uncertain [overlay] that we should take a more conservative posture in doing that.  Now let\u2019s continue with our review with the financial results from our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Bahash.  Bob.", "Robert Bahash", "", "Okay, thank you Terry.  We\u2019ve covered a lot of material this morning so let\u2019s just take a moment to sum up the key points and our new guidance for 2008.  For McGraw-Hill Education, guidance is unchanged.  We continue to expect revenue growth of 6-8% and a 50-100 basis point decline in the operating margin due to stepped up technology investments and increased republication costs.", "One addition item I\u2019d like to briefly mention is the transfer of our advanced placement courses from higher education to the school education group.  These AP courses are taken by high school students for college credit and will now be sold by the sales team that directly serves the high school market.  We\u2019ve provided the reclassification of 2007 revenue by quarter in exhibit 3 of the earnings release.", "Due to the seasonality of the business, this transfer is not material to the two group\u2019s first quarter revenue but will be later in the year as well as for the full year results.  Guidance for information and media also remains unchanged.  We continue to expect 6-8% revenue growth and improved margins.  We are also maintaining our earlier forecast for double digit growth at S&P investment services.", "However, as Terry indicated, there\u2019s little or no improvement in the financial markets this year, if there isn\u2019t, particularly in structured finance area, we would expect the financial services segment\u2019s revenue to decline by 7-9% and the operating margin to be reduced by 500-600 basis points.  And if that\u2019s the case our earnings per share in 2008 could range between $2.65-$2.75 per share.  Neither the benefits nor the associated termination costs of the action as Terry mentioned earlier are reflected in this guidance.", "Given this scenario of reduced earnings, there\u2019s a corresponding impact on our outlook for free cash flow.  Now first let\u2019s be clear on how we define free cash flow.  We start with our after tax cash from operations, of course after working capital and deduct investments and dividends.  What\u2019s left if free cash flow, funds that we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt.", "We started the year by forecasting free cash flow for 2008 in the range of $850 million to $900 million.  Our new estimate for free cash flow this year is approximately $600 million, prior to any acquisitions or share repurchases.  This new forecast is driven by reduced profits at financial services and the corresponding impact on working capital.", "These two factors will be partially mitigated by a careful review of new investments in our businesses which I will discuss in a few moments.  Regarding acquisitions, we\u2019ve spent about $34 million, two in the first quarter, Maalot, an Israeli securities ratings company that now becomes S&P Maalot, the licensing rights to S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Indices and Umbria in the second quarter, a marketing intelligence company specializing in social media and consumer generated media research to enhance J.D. Power\u2019s voice of the customer studies.", "Our reduced free cash flow combined with these acquisitions has implications for our stock buyback target.  As you know we began the year with 28 million shares remaining in the 2007 program authorized by the Board of Directors.  We targeted 20 million shares for repurchase in 2008.  In the first quarter we repurchased 3.4 million shares for a total cost of $134 million at an average price of $39.42 per share.  With the reduction in available free cash flow, as well as our focus on maintaining net debt levels comparable to year end 2007, our new target this year will be approximately 15 million shares.", "Net debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.2 billion.  This reflects a $400 million increase versus year end 2007 and is driven primarily by seasonal cash requirements in the first quarter as well as funding for share repurchases.  Now as of March 31 on a gross basis, the total debt is comprised of $1.2 billion of unsecured senior notes and $396.2 million in commercial paper outstanding.", "This is offset by $396.7 million in cash which is primarily in foreign holdings.  As a result of the lower share repurchase target, we now expect net interest expense in the range of $75 to $85 million and that\u2019s down from our initial forecast of $80-$100 million for 2008.  In the first quarter of 2008 net interest expense was $18 million compared to only $1.2 million in the same period last year.", "Now let\u2019s look at our diluted weighted average shares outstanding our WASO.  For the first quarter WASO was 323.4 million shares, a 38.1 million share decrease compared to the first quarter of 2007 and a 7.4 million share decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Corporate expenses decrease $1.2 million in the first quarter to $33.9 million versus the same period last year.  This is primarily driven by lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of our financial performance.  For 2008, we now expect a mid-single digit decrease in corporate expenses versus our previous guidance of a low single digit increase.  This change is driven primarily by reduced incentive compensation as well as stringent expense controls.", "I\u2019d like to take a few moments to discuss the impact of incentive compensation on McGraw-Hill\u2019s first quarter results as well as a general comment on expenses.  The company\u2019s results benefitted from decreased incentive compensation including stock based compensation.  That benefit was most pronounced at S&P, which saw a $40 million decrease year over year.  ", "If the financial markets don\u2019t recover, we would a expect year over year decline in incentive compensation expense to continue throughout the year, although it will not be as significant in the second half of 2008 due to the slowdown that we did experience in the second half of 2007 and then impacted with that was the corresponding lower incentive compensation accruals last year.", "Regarding expenses, in particular at financial services we\u2019re balancing prudent investments while keeping a watchful eye on costs.  That means investing in business that are growing such as index services and Capital IQ as well as recent acquisitions including IMake and Clarify in 2007 and Maalat in early 2008.", "We\u2019re making these investments while also maintaining strict expense controls at credit market services, including decisions related to new hires.  Now as you know included in the expense category is other income from gains from divestitures.  Included in your exhibits, exhibit 2 reflects revenue by operating segment, costs and expense by operating segment net profit.  So imbedded within the expense categories would be any gains from divestitures or gains from sale of assets.", "The first quarter of 2007, as you know, included a gain from the divestiture of the mutual fund data business that Terry mentioned, that was $17.3 million, partially offset by operating expense for this business prior to the divestiture.  Also, expense for 2008 include costs for the acquisitions that I previously mentioned that were not in 2007.  The reported change in expense which is shown on exhibit 2 is an increase of almost 1%, 0.9%.  ", "In order to make the year over year comparisons more meaningful, I\u2019ve adjusted for the net gain in 2007 for the mutual fund data business and acquisition operating costs for 2008.  As a result, expenses actually declined in the first quarter of 2008 compared to 2007 by $16 million or 4% versus the reported expense increase of 0.9%.  In addition we continued to make investments for a number of our growing businesses, such as index services, Capital IQ and Crisil.", "But another important measure is to compare expenses in the first quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2007.  The sequential quarter comparison reflects a $70 million or 15.4% decline in expenses from the fourth quarter.  And that excludes the restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter.  Lower incentive compensation is certainly a key driven but not as significant as the Q1 2008 to Q1 2007 comparison as we also reduced incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "So, we are benefiting from our focus on expense management, hiring delays and curtailments as well as the fourth quarter restructuring actions.  I\u2019ll now review unearned revenue which was $1.1 billion at the end of the first quarter and reflects and 11.5% year over year increase.  Excluding foreign exchange currency gains here, the increase is 9.7%.  For 2008, we continued to expect that growth will moderate given the forecast for slower revenue growth.", "In terms of our effective tax rate, we expect the rate to be 37.5% in 2008, approximately the same rate as 2007 on a full year basis.  Let\u2019s now look at capital expenditures which include publication investments and purchases of property and equipment.  In the first quarter our pre-publication investments were $67 million compared to $57 million in the same period last year.", "We were projected $300-$310 million in pre-pub investments for the year, we now expect $290 million for 2008 which reflects prudent investments and continued off-shoring efficiencies.  Purchases of property and equipment were $24 million in the first quarter compared to $23 million in the same period last year.  For 2008 we now expect lower cap ex which is projected to be about $160 million for normal replacement expenditures, additional purchases of software and technology equipment for the new data center in the first half of 2008 and continued investments in technology.", "And finally now for some non-cash items.  Amortization of pre-publication costs was $28 million for both years.  For 2008 we continue to expect amortization to increase $45 million to $285 million.  This is driven by significant pre-publication investments to take advantage of opportunities in the el-high market which as Terry mentioned is expected to grow 10-15% this year.  Depreciation was $27.5 million, compared to $29 million in the same period last year.", "We still expect it to be approximately $125 million in 2008, reflecting the completion of the data center, the purchase of new technology equipment for the data center and other increases in capital expenditures.  Finally amortization of intangibles was $14 million compared to $12 million in the same period last year.  For 2008, we expect approximately $52 million.", "Now thank you and back to Terry.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Okay, thank you Bob and again you know, in a difficult first quarter we were pleased to do $0.25, especially given the steep decline in the structured finance area.  And as we said at the beginning of the year, you know we see that we\u2019re going to be impacted in the first half of this year and especially given the strength of the comparisons from last year.  But we do see substantive improvement you know for the second half.", "I also again was given a note that some people were having difficulty seeing the slides and again they will be posted on our investor relations website at the conclusion of this meeting.  Let me go back now to Don Rubin, head of investor relations.", "Donald Rubin", "", "Thank you Terry.  (Instructions)  We are now ready for our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you our first question comes from Peter Appert at Goldman Sachs, your line is open.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you, Terry two questions please.  The investment services unit with 18% revenue gain was quite impressive in the context of the market backdrop, can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that and how important pricing is to that gain.  ", "And then the second question is, just on the indication of potentially more staffing cuts, should we read that to be an indication that maybe the second quarter in particular is off to a relatively soft start or pace of business maybe has gotten a little bit worse?  Thank you.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Okay, thanks Peter.  First of all in investment services as you know, you know, we have been increasingly building on that.  And the index services side has been very, very strong.  But the overall portfolio services and the equity research side has also showed significant gains.  ", "The third part is Capital IQ, not only are we gaining on customer penetration, you\u2019re also starting to see because of all of the product enhancements and things like the charting functionality and things like that, you know that we think that that\u2019s going to lead to even more revenue enhancement there.", "As far as you know cost containment or any kind of thing, that becomes Peter obviously when you have a significant revenue shortfall as we do in the structured finance area, until we start seeing any kind of meaningful pickup in activity, we\u2019re going to be very, very tough on those expenses.  And I think that as we\u2019ve said from the very beginning, we\u2019re going to do it in staged phases.", "We did the first phase when we first started getting faced with some of these issues in the fourth quarter of last year.  We did another phase in the beginning of this year and I think that what we\u2019re examining and what we\u2019re looking at now is another phase, kind of activity.  I do believe that in the structured finance area we\u2019re seeing very, very low volumes in the first quarter.  Very similar to the fourth quarter of last year.  And I think even though we\u2019re starting to see some activity, you know the first half of the year will be impacted by that.", "But if we start to see increased activity on this one, I think the second half is going to be a very different picture, much more positive picture to us and position us better for 2009.  So at this point we will continue to be very, very strict on cost and you\u2019ll be seeing more activity associated with that.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "How about on the education side, specifically Terry I think you indicated some more cuts there, what\u2019s driving that?", "Terry McGraw", "", "There for the most part is the emphasis on the digital transformation.  And you know we are shifting from some of the legacy products to some of the educational services and some of the digital product enhancements.  We\u2019re starting to see more market demand and therefore we\u2019re responding to that.  ", "Part of it, Bob talked about, where we are in terms of some of the pre-pub costs, we\u2019ve been able to cut back on some of those pre-pub costs at the same time we\u2019re increasing investment on the digital side and we\u2019re pleased by that.  We want to see more progress in terms of that transformation.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks Terry.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber, Lehman Brothers.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Yes, good morning, a couple questions.  Can you talk a little bit about your recurring fees for the rest of the year, it was up about 50% in the first quarter, do you expect that to be up the remainder of the year.  I\u2019m particularly concerned about when you get roughly to the fourth quarter of this year when your transaction base was down significantly a year ago, shouldn\u2019t we see the recurring fees down at that point or no?", "Robert Bahash", "", "I think as I pointed out, the unearned revenue, when you think about that growth, it was 11% after currency it was about 9.5%.  But as I mentioned, with the slower revenue growth during the course of the year, you\u2019ll see a corresponding slower growth in revenue from unearned revenue during the course of the year.  So those numbers will start to slowly decline.  But we are expecting growth, just not at the same pace that we\u2019ve been experiencing over the past several years.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Just to be clear, even if you take your conservative case if market conditions continue as they are for the rest of the year, do you still expect your recurring fees, surveillance annual contracts, subscriptions to be up year over year for the remainder of the year?", "Robert Bahash", "", "Yeah we do because a fair amount of that recurring revenue is coming from the corporate and government side and that is as you probably know, investment grade issuance was pretty darn strong in the month of April, some pretty good GE credit went out, you got Bristol-Meyers, you got Monsanto.  A number of big issuers are hitting the marketplace and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing some of those recurring fees.  So albeit at a slower growth rate, but nevertheless we\u2019re going to be experiencing growth during the course of the year.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Can you give us a sense out of that roughly $200 million of recurring fees, what rough percentage of that would be surveillance fees?", "Robert Bahash", "", "No, we really can\u2019t break it down that finely.  But you\u2019re really talking about program fees, annual fees, we\u2019re talking about general relationship fees, frequent issuer fees, there\u2019s a number of different categories that we have within there.  We really can\u2019t break it down that finely, but there\u2019s a number of ways that we categorize it to cover all the various markets.  I really couldn\u2019t break it down that finely for you.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Yeah but Craig you know the other aspect of that is that it\u2019s still a significant factor for us.  And you know even though the growth rate will decline a little bit, it will still be at a very healthy rate.  And as things start to improve I think you know we\u2019ll start to see that number go back up as well.  But it\u2019s still at a very healthy double digit rate.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "And my second question please, what is the average length in terms of number of years of the stuff that you guys actually rate?  Eight to ten years roughly, the average length of stuff you guys rate?", "Terry McGraw", "", "That\u2019s an issue that differs by asset class.  Let me ask Deven Sharma, Deven you want to comment?", "Deven Sharma", "", "Yeah, in the structured areas, certainly shorter timeframes and in the corporate instruments it\u2019s somewhere between five to eight or ten years.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay and then the last question, as you guys look out here over the next year or so, what asset class of fixed income would you advise investors to focus on that you think would come back first?  Would it be investment grade municipals or the higher grade stuff?", "Terry McGraw", "", "Well, you know I better be careful given investment advice on this one.  But you know certainly at this point, as we were commenting, you know the attention is really to investment grade at this point.  When you start talking about the high yield markets and you start talking about some parts of the structured finance market, you know it will be a little bit more slow in coming and I think there will be obviously a bias towards quality.  ", "And you\u2019ll see more plain vanilla issuance from that standpoint.  But you know clearly there is a bias to quality at this point.  And I think in terms of activity we\u2019re seeing still a very healthy asset backed market.  You know both in terms of credit card receivables and in terms of some of the auto loans area.  Also, I would look to the commercial mortgage backed market you know to come back a little bit quicker.  Right now what you\u2019re seeing is some of those deals being done through leveraged loans but you know I think you will see more activity from that standpoint.  ", "And also in terms of the municipal market that you\u2019ll see a healthier situation there.  So you know overall what I think what we\u2019re seeing is obviously the credit crunch is having its effect, it\u2019s contained in the structured finance market and as that starts to unwind you\u2019re going to start to see improvement.  And we\u2019re looking to the second half of this year to start to see some of that.", "Robert Bahash", "", "Terry if I could add to that.  April is a very, very busy month for investment grade.  Just to give you an example, GE did a three tranche deal, $8.5 billion, Oracle a $5 billion three tranche deal, $4 billion three tranche transaction from Verizon, Bristol-Meyers just this week a $600 million transaction, same with Monsanto.  ", "So we\u2019re seeing a fair amount of really key activity as rates are where they are from very significant investment grade properties as the spreads to treasuries are starting to come in.  So hopefully that will bode well for the balance of the year.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Barton Crockett, J.P. Morgan.", "Barton Crockett \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "Okay, great, thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to zero in a little bit more on the trend that you\u2019re seeing in the financial services top line.  You\u2019ve given kind of a range of revenue, we saw the 12% or so decline in the first quarter and you\u2019re saying 7-9% decline for the year.  Can you give us a sense of whether the second quarter is pacing within that range or outside of it, either on the upside or the downside in terms of the aggregate top line that you\u2019re seeing right now.", "Terry McGraw", "", "I\u2019m sorry Barton, I didn\u2019t get all of your question.  In terms of the revenue for the second quarter, again we\u2019re not looking at, we don\u2019t forecast [unintelligible] performance, but clearly you know what we want to see is continued improvement in some of the categories of structured.  You know commercial mortgage back is still soft, residential mortgage backed, obviously you know is dormant right now.  ", "But the asset backed area is showing signs of improvement and we want to continue to see that side of it.  As Bob was saying, the corporate and government side is showing a healthy increase in terms of corporate treasurers starting to finance more in terms of long bonds versus in commercial paper or other kinds of issues.  ", "So you know the second quarter is going to be still affected by the current conditions that we\u2019re facing here, but through very strong product diversity and geographic expansion and cost containment, we\u2019ll be hopeful that we will be able to have a stable position on that.  The second half is where we\u2019re going to start to see hopefully the improvement.", "Barton Crockett \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "Okay and then I think everyone would agree that your business\u2019 obviously cyclical issues, but a lot of this will come back as the market normalizes, but some portions of it may not come back or it may come back at levels nothing like what we saw before.  Could you give us your take on where you\u2019d see that, what portions of the issuance market and how large you might size the portion of that market that may not come back?", "I\u2019m thinking about some of the more exotic structured finance products or maybe residential mortgage backed securities where the agencies have raised the conforming loan limits.", "Terry McGraw", "", "I think that clearly the structured finance market is going to come back more gradually.  And again you\u2019re going to see more of a flight to quality and you\u2019re going to see less of an appetite for high yield or high risk kind of instruments.  But again as confidence comes back into the market, we will see that increase.  Do I believe that we will get back to levels that we saw in the past, yes.  Because I believe that the securitization process is a fundamental driver in the investment community.  ", "And institutional investors love that product and they have so much mobility with that product in terms of all the things that they can do with it.  So you know it will come back, it\u2019s just going to take a little time to restore the confidence and trust in the system and to understand and make sure that people understand the risks associated with that kind of product.  So it\u2019s really a timing question.", "Barton Crockett \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "Okay, great, I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Catriona Fallon, Citi.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Yes, good morning.  Could you give us an update on where you are on the announced headcount reductions from early January?  So what was the change in headcount for the quarter?", "Deven Sharma", "", "We have completed our headcount reduction in financial services that we announced in December.  And Bob and Terry for education.", "Robert Bahash", "", "The education and corporate areas that also announced some downsizings have both been completed as well.  I think in all categories though, individuals remained on the payroll during a portion of the first quarter.  So we really start to see the benefits come more dramatically in the second quarter and beyond.", "Terry McGraw", "", "And again, Catriona, one of the things that we have done is we talked about staged and three stages.  The first one was once we saw the situation deteriorate we did go into a hiring freeze.  And then we announced the restructuring charge for the second stage relative to the lack of activity.  Given the first quarter steep decline in structured finance equal to what we saw in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re examining another stage at this point.  But we want to be very measured relative to the activity levels.  And as we start to things start to improve, we want to be measured in terms of how we respond to that.  ", "Again, you know, especially when we talk about the structured finance area, these are very, very talented people and therefore in terms of making some of those kind of cuts you want to be very measured in doing that.  But we are examining now another component to that.  But you also want to make sure that in terms of the ongoing business that you have in the surveillance area, that you\u2019re staffed to be able to do that.  But you know we are examining another stage.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay, great.  And then just quickly on the education business, it seems that your competitor Pierson is looking for a lower growth rate in the elementary high school area.  Can you help us understand what gives you more confidence that this growth is actually higher than kind of the low single digits for that category?", "Terry McGraw", "", "Yeah, there\u2019s two areas here.  In the el-high area you\u2019ve got both the adoption market and you\u2019ve got the open territory market.  You also have major states in play with California, Texas and Florida you\u2019ve got significant opportunities there.  You also have a significant increase in state adoption monies, 10-15%, we\u2019re looking at $900-$950 million there.  And we fully expect to take share here.  ", "And in the open territories, we\u2019ve been very conservative in saying that after the last two years, we\u2019re saying 1-2% because you know, one we don\u2019t know and secondly it\u2019s almost untenable that you won\u2019t see growth in these markets.  Some of these states are already behind and given the fact that education is a priority in all of these states and the funding level seems to be very healthy, you know we would expect to see open territory growth here as well.  So from our standpoint, you know, the 6-8% growth of the segment reflects a pretty good situation for the el-high market but also for the higher-ed market as well.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay and then just quickly, on the guidance, it seems that that\u2019s assuming essentially the market that we were experiencing at the end of March and since then we\u2019ve seen CMBS spreads come in, we\u2019ve seen agency spreads and corporate spreads also come in and you\u2019ve made some comments that corporate activity is already up in April.  ", "Do you think that from what you\u2019ve seen in the month of April that you know you\u2019re more likely to come in above that guidance even if structured finance is down, some of the other categories are already seeing strength?", "Terry McGraw", "", "You know, again, we\u2019re still in a soft period and it\u2019s very uncertain.  So what we tried to do, we\u2019re giving some guidance but as to put some boundaries here.  And if the first quarter activity levels like the fourth quarter levels continue, you know, then the forecast of down 7-9% of financial services and 500 basis points or so in margin, would be probably more appropriate.  ", "I personally don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to happen but what I think doesn\u2019t matter, we need to see some of that activity level.  And we\u2019re starting to get a little encouraged by some of the things that we\u2019re seeing.  But I would say overall that even though the corporate and government area is showing some really good upside that Bob was talking about in terms of treasurers going into investment grade long term quality on that, that\u2019s there.  ", "I think the structured finance market is going to a gradual recovery on that part.  But we are seeing some upside and we will keep giving you the best guidance we\u2019ve got as we go.  I do think the second half is going to be a much different situation than the first half of this year.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Michael Meltz, Bear Stearns.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Thank you.  Two questions and then a follow up, Bob can you give us at financial services, what was the contribution from acquisitions on the top line in the quarter?  And then on your quasi-guidance for segment margin for the year, the down 500-600 basis points, what are you using as the 07 number because it was, it had a divestiture and it had a charge in there in 07, just want to make sure I have the right reference point.  And then I have a follow up.", "Robert Bahash", "", "Let\u2019s start first with the impact of the acquisition revenue on the first quarter.  It was relatively small, it was about, roughly seven-tenths of a percent.  More importantly I think the impact on currency benefitted the financial services segment by about 1.4% as well.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Okay and then the year ago margin.", "Robert Bahash", "", "44.7%.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Okay.  My question is then on the cost side, it would seem if I run that through, it would seem you\u2019re modeling costs off low single digits at financial services in 08 which I\u2019d say flattish to up low single digits which would seem kind of odd given what you did in the first quarter and you were talking about additional benefit coming forward and perhaps some more cost take outs.  Is there some seasonality there, is there another factor?  If I just take the run rate for the quarter, it\u2019s well below that number.", "Robert Bahash", "", "Yeah, the quarter benefitted significantly from lower incentive compensation.  Now there\u2019s two drivers there, first is the short term incentive compensation that is based on the current year performance and there\u2019s another element relating to our three year long term incentive which based on the forecast that we\u2019re going with, we adjusted those as well.  So there are two significant adjustments make up that $40 million affecting the financial services segment in the quarter.  ", "Now last year, 2007, we started to make adjustments to the incentive compensation accruals in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter last year.  You may recall first and second quarters are very strong, we had built our incentive accruals based on an expectation that the year was going to continue going that way.  It actually started to decline.  We pulled back incentive accruals a bit in the third quarter as well as in the fourth quarter.  So when you look at the lower incentive, just using that as a basis, the run rate will be at a lower rate going forward.  ", "In addition, there are some other very significant parts of the business that Terry mentioned.  When we look at Capital IQ, the data and information side, equity research, we look at our acquisition of Crisil and the growth rates we\u2019re seeing in Crisil as well as the acquisitions we made this year, we\u2019re making investments in those businesses, we\u2019re adding people to those businesses to drive that top line double digit revenue growth that we\u2019re forecasting.  ", "So we\u2019re looking at a blended rate in terms of the overall impact on expense.  Clearly as Terry pointed out and Deven pointed out, we\u2019re focused very strongly on being sure that we have right sized the credit market services business based on the environment that we\u2019re in as well as making certain that we have the appropriate talent in house to do the appropriate levels of surveillance that is necessary to meet market needs.  So hopefully that gives you an idea, flavor of where we\u2019re going.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Michael I would only add to that, you know how important the global side of this is.  Again both in terms of the Asian markets as well as parts of the European, those are very important.  We\u2019re very excited about the operations out of Dubai and the work we\u2019re doing there.  And these will increasingly be very, very important areas as both China, India, the Middle East and also the African markets.  Right now in South Africa but also in terms of some of the urbanization and infrastructure development there as well.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 Bear Stearns", "One last question from me, can you, I know it\u2019s not a simple question but can you give us some type of bridge to get from your prior free cash flow guidance to the new $600 million number.  I guess I\u2019m just struggling to see how the number got, the components of that decline, Bob is there any way you can walk us through that?", "Robert Bahash", "", "Yeah I\u2019ll do it in general terms, not to be very specific.  But first of all it\u2019s our projection of the impact of the $2.65 to $2.75.  What that does to our lower overall net income.  Also, there\u2019s a couple of items that influence our cash.  As an example with regard to our data center, we had accrued certain construction costs at the end of the year 2007 but we\u2019ve made payments of about $30 million associated with that this year.  Also our profit sharing contribution, we shifted the payment into January of 2008 for 2007.  ", "We had not done that in previous years, we had the opportunity to do that, so we did do that.  Also we have basically payments for the incentive compensation for 2007, those payments need to be made by March roughly of 2008 and we don\u2019t have the corresponding accruals built for this particular year.  That gives you a general idea but that generally walks down from the $900 to the $600 million.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 Bear Stearns", "That\u2019s very helpful.  Thank you.", "Terry McGraw", "", "In terms of the slides for those people that were not able to see the slides, they are now available on the investor relations website for downloading on that one.

We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call, however this call is for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Mr. Steve Weiss in our New York office subsequent to this call.", "Today's update will last approximately an hour. After our presentations we will open the meeting to questions and answers. It's now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Terry McGraw", "Good morning everybody and welcome to our review of the McGraw-Hill Companies second quarter earnings and the outlook for the rest of 2008. Bob Bahash our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer is joining me today on this call. I\u2019ll begin by reviewing the second quarter results and our prospects then Bob will review our financial performance and obviously we\u2019ll be pleased to take any comments or questions that you might have.", "Earlier this morning as Don said we announced second quarter results. Earnings per share were $0.66 that included a pre-tax restructuring charge of $23.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share primarily for the severance costs relating to a work force reduction of 395 positions. Revenue for the second quarter declined by 2.6%. ", "The biggest national housing recession since the great depression and the credit crunch in the financial markets obviously continue to have an effect on our results. David Wyss who is our S&P Chief Economist doesn\u2019t expect the housing prices to bottom out until the first half of 2009. The large supply of unsold existing homes continues to weigh on the market. David expects housing sales and starts to bottom out some time in the third quarter of 2008 but prices will probably have about another 10% to go. Again, we\u2019re looking for somewhere in the later part of the second quarter 2009.", "The Federal Reserve is not expected to take any action on interest rates at its August 5th meeting. In fact, the next move expected from the Fed will be rate hike probably in the second quarter of next year. David Wyss estimates gross domestic product, GDP growth of 1.7% in the second quarter and 1.8% in the third quarter as consumers spend the rebate checks so a lot of activity moving forward into the second and third quarter and therefore he expects negative growth in the fourth quarter of this year and in the first quarter of 2009 followed by 3% growth in the second quarter next year.", "In this environment states are dealing with falling tax receipts and challenging budgets but that has raised questions about the outlook for education budgets and of course in the new fiscal year that started July 1, and we have 46 states that start their new budgets July 1. The states are working very hard to protect educational funding. ", "A new survey of state education budgets by McGraw-Hill Education has pinpointed information on K-12 education budgets in 38 states and we\u2019ve learned that most of these states education budgets are increasing in the new fiscal year although at a slower rate than last year. The increase is averaging about 3.5% for the new fiscal year versus about 10% last year. We have seen at this point reductions in K-12 education budgets in only three states, two of them are flat.", "There\u2019s another factor to consider in evaluating state budgets and its bond issuance. In the face of declining tax revenues states are now more likely to step up bond issuance in the new fiscal year and that\u2019s a plus for Standard & Poor\u2019s. With that as background let\u2019s turn to the review of the operations.", "Let\u2019s begin with McGraw-Hill Education, a very good start in what is expected to be a robust state new adoption market this year was a key factor in McGraw-Hill Education second quarter performance. For the second quarter revenue increased 3.6%, operating profit including a pre-tax restructuring charge of $8.5 million declined by $10.9 million or 13.5%. The operating margin was 10.4% versus 12.4% last year. The restructuring charge reduced the operating margin by 126 basis points.", "The McGraw-Hill School Education Group increased revenue by 6.9% to $438.2 million and the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Profession and International Group saw revenue decline of 2.1%. With the decision making largely completed in the adoption state we have a pretty good idea at this point of our prospects there. As you know in 2007 we captured 32% of the state new adoption market and that was worth about $820 million.", "In 2008 we expect to capture about a third of an even larger state new adoption market. We estimate this year\u2019s market will come in between $900 and $950 million. The biggest opportunities this year are in reading and math. The key adoption states are Florida, Texas and California. We expect to produce solid results in both key disciplines in all of our key adoption states.", "In the second quarter we saw the first signs of our successful campaigns as orders came in for reading from Florida and math from Texas, an exceptional year is taking shape in Florida, we\u2019re very pleased here where Treasures our balance basal program which has been widely adopted but that\u2019s not the whole story. ", "We compete obviously with a spectrum of products because US education is not a one size fits all market so we will take additional market share in Florida with our alternative basals and those are Imagine It! and Reading Mastery Plus. As a result, our products will account for more than half of this years Florida K-5 reading market. ", "We also did very well in Texas with our new state specific balance basal math program and in California we expect to build on last year\u2019s success in science with an excellent performance in the sizeable second year K-8 adoption. We also anticipate good results there in the K-8 math with our new state specific balance basal and with Everyday Mathematics.", "In the overall K-12 reading and literature state new adoption markets we expect solid results in Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. Spotlight on Music is leading the elementary market and our fine arts, health, business and vocational lines are performing well in states adopting these categories.", "The supplemental market remains sluggish. Although we\u2019re enjoying some success with intervention products our prospects in this market got an unexpected boost last week when the Texas Education Agency announced a new $15 million opportunity for reading intervention programs. That new funding will be spent during the 2008-2009 school year on the Texas intensive reading initiative for grades four through grade eight.", "Three of our intervention programs have been adopted, that\u2019s Reading Triumphs, Corrective Reading, and Jamestown Reading Navigator. They represent comprehensive print and digital solutions for students reading below grade level.", "Summing up the outlook for the elementary high school market in 2008 a solid year is taking shape in the state new adoption market. The bulk of open territory orders traditionally come in the third quarter and we\u2019re still looking for some increase in these states. This market should grow 1% to 2%. Obviously we\u2019re hoping for more. We still expect to gain share in the overall K-12 market which will grow probably 4% to 5% this year.", "In the Testing market we compete with a spectrum of assessment products, Acuity, which is our new formative product, continues to win new customers. We are winning new business for our TABE series which offers diagnostic assessments and instructor support for adult students. With our LAS Links series for English language learners, last week Nevada, for example, extended its contract for LAS Links for three years to serve nearly 80,000 English language learners in the state.", "Our system helps states ensure compliance with no child left behind Title Three requirements and we\u2019re seeing some changes in no child left behind requirements that play to our strength in testing. The US Department of Education has been permitting states to add a growth component to their school accountability programs. The growth model looks at the academic performance at individual students to determine if they\u2019re on track to become proficient.", "If students score below the proficient stand in reading or math but are still making progress and appear likely to achieve proficiency they may be counted among the schools proficient students. Eleven states have not been permitted to add a growth component to their state accountability plan. Growth components require the development of a vertical scale. We have strong industry recognized expertise in vertical scaling which links one grade to another so schools can see how students are progressing from grade to grade.", "Our TerraNova testing series has vertical scales and the same it true for our Acuity predictive test which enables us to show a growth through formative assessments a significant competitive advantage for schools and teachers.", "In the Higher Education international and professional markets we saw some softness in the second quarter as book stores cut orders and reduced inventory. Some college textbook distributors also shifted the timing of their orders for the fall semester from late June into July. We expect softness in professional markets for the balance of the year. It\u2019s a combination of tough comparisons. Last year we had the benefit of a new edition of the Encyclopedia of Science and Technology. This year we\u2019re facing the impact of the economy on book store sales.", "We now expect our US College and University business to grow about 4% to 6% this year. However, sales of our digital, custom and career product lines are showing stronger growth. The outlook is mixed in international markets. Summing up for McGraw Hill Education overall, slower growth in our Higher Education professional and international market may reduce the rate of increase in revenue this year for McGraw-Hill Education.", "Our original forecast called for revenue growth of 6% to 8%. We now estimate revenue growth of 4% to 6% in 2008 and we\u2019ll have to see as orders come in in August and again July/August for them we call it the 60 day month. We\u2019re not changing our estimate however on the operating margin. Our estimate of 50 to 100 basis point decline in the segments operating margin holds.", "Let\u2019s move now to Financial Services, for our Financial Services segment the second quarter will probably be the most challenging of the year. S&P peaked last year in the second quarter achieving its highest levels of revenue and operating profit as a structured finance market continued to surge. In face of tough comparisons this year, diversification and cost containment where critical factors in our performance.", "For the second quarter revenue declined 10.4%, operating profit including a $15.2 million pre-tax restructuring charge was down 25.4% and operating margin was 40.7% down from 48.9% last year. Restructuring charges reduced the operating margin in the second quarter by just over 200 basis points. In a typical first half Financial Services produced an operating margin of 40.5% and that includes the second quarter restructuring charge. The restructuring charge reduced the operating margin by 110 basis points.", "The performance underscores some very key components about the outlook for Financial Services. First, diversification contributed importantly to our results. Secondly, our strategy buffers Standard & Poor\u2019s against the decline in new issuance. Three, the cost containment will continue to be a priority and fourth, while there have been more headlines and new rule and regulatory proposals in recent weeks there is no change in our assessment of legal or regulatory risks. In my opinion, both remain low. Fifth, our guidance for the segment in 2008 remains unchanged. ", "If the decline we experience in the first half in structured finance continues for the remainder of the year then we believe that revenue for Financial Services could be off 7% to 9% in 2008. Under these circumstances we would also expect a 500 to 600 basis point pull back in the segments operating profit but that\u2019s if we experience the decline in structured finance that we saw in the first half.", "Now let\u2019s examine these points in more detail and let\u2019s start with the impact of diversification. A key aspect of diversification is illustrated by this table which compares results of Financial Services with new issue dollar volume in the bond market. Revenue for the Financial Services decline 10.4% and S&P Credit Market Services was off 20.1%. Global new issues dollar volume fell 32.5% in the second quarter. Domestic revenue for the credit market services was off 30.6% while total US new issue dollar volume fell by 44.4%.", "In the second quarter international revenue for credit market services was down 3.3% while international new issue dollar volume declined by 20%. As we had forecasted Standard & Poor\u2019s Investment Services produced double digit revenue growth up 22.8% for the second quarter and 20.4% for the first half. We still expect double digit revenue growth from these non-rating businesses for the full year.", "We continue to expand in data and analytics both here an abroad. The Capital IQ products are attracting new customers in both domestic and international markets. Capital IQ now has more than 2,400 customers worldwide and that is a 23% increase compared to last year. Our index services are still rolling ahead adding new products and more customers. Assets under management in exchange traded funds based on S&P indices grew by 15.5% to $206.3 billion versus the same period last year.", "Sales of our custom indices and data also increased. Trading in exchanged traded derivatives based on S&P indexes has been robust. The average daily volume of contracts for the major exchange traded derivatives was 2,820,000 in the second quarter and that\u2019s up 25% from the comparable quarter last year. Trading of over the counter derivatives also increased substantially due in part to our products and that includes the S&P GSCI Index, the S&P Diversified Trend Indicator and the S&P Commodities Trend Indicator and the S&P Select Plus Custom Series.", "Investment banks licensed these products from S&P to create structured vehicles that are linked to their performance. For example, to pick one of them the S&P Diversified Trend Indicator is a composite of 24 highly liquid future contracts and they\u2019re grouped in 14 different sectors evenly weighted between financials and physical commodities. ", "The S&P DTI positions each sector except energy either long or short based on its price behavior relative to its moving average. It\u2019s just another example of all the things that I think are possible with these kinds of instruments. It\u2019s all about innovation and creativity, there\u2019s an endless permeation of the number that you can come up with. We continue to expand. ", "Let me quickly recap this year\u2019s activity for S&P indices. Eighteen new exchange traded funds were launched in the second quarter, 31 new exchange traded funds were launched in the first half compared to 46 for all of 2007 and there are now a total of 175 exchange traded funds based on S&P indices and we have more new indices on the launch pad of the second half.", "Our effort to diversify is not limited to S&P investments services. Diversification is also an important strategic activity at S&P Credit Market Services reducing S&P\u2019s dependence on the new issue market and expanding internationally our key initiatives the 13.7% increase in non-transaction revenue for the second quarter and 12.5% for the first half are tangible measures of our success clearly growth in this area helped partially offset the decline in new issue markets.", "Non-transaction revenue includes surveillance fees, annual contracts and subscriptions, all three categories grew in the second quarter as did deferred revenue for the financial services segment. Incidentally deferred revenue for this segment increased 12% in the second quarter to just over $840 million. We expect deferred revenue in this segment to continue growing.", "In this environment obviously cost containment is vitally important. We are closely managing costs while making investments to assure that S&P is prepared for the turn around in credit markets and growth in our non-ratings businesses. We have taken a measured approach to restructuring by eliminating approximately 170 positions at the end of 2007 and another 246 positions in the second quarter.", "We have also reduced incentive compensation in our effort to streamline the organization we will continue to examine the management structure and make process improvements. We\u2019re watching the hiring and that means a very selective. Reduction of discretionary expenses is a priority and Bob Bahash will provide more information on costs and expenses in just a moment.", "The US structured finance market continues to show major declines in the second quarter. New issue dollar volume was obviously down and you can see the numbers on the chart in front of you 75.4% in April, 81.8% in May, 84% in June 79% for the first half. Only the issuance of asset backed securities is up after six months but not by much 0.2%. ", "With these bar charts we have been illustrating the monthly comparison in US new issue volume since the beginning of 2008. There is a sequential improvement in US Corporate new issuance in the second quarter. June was the best month of the second quarter for public finance. Even a sequential pick up in structured finance is hard to spot. Based on early indications in July we don\u2019t expect to see much change in these patterns this month. Year over year comparisons don\u2019t start to get easier until September.", "There are signs that the market is healing but has not yet healed. Despite the turmoil in credit markets, investment grade issuers show strength in the second quarter as better known issuers attracted receptive investors. Nearly all of the recent deals have been substantially oversubscribed and indication that there\u2019s plenty of cash available. We think the corporate outlook for the second half is promising although speculative grade issuance will remain weak.", "We expect more growth in public finance. The state and local government pipeline continues to look strong. We expect growth in international markets in the second half. We will benefit from our geographic expansion into the Gulf and Central and Eastern Europe. Refinancing requirements of industrials in Europe should also be a source of growth and activity remains very slow in the structured market.", "We are seeing some interesting developments in the US residential mortgage backed securities market. The focus will probably continue to be on the secondary market trades and all of the repackaging. As a result S&P may have some opportunities to rate some of the re-securitizations or Re-REMICs. ", "There\u2019s also growing US interest in covered bonds which have been issued in Europe since the 1700\u2019s. Some market participants believe covered bonds could stimulate the US mortgage market but since the US does not have an explicit legal framework for covered bonds there\u2019s not an effort to resolve that issue and Secretary Treasurer Hank Paulson was referring to that just the other day. If that effort succeeds large capitalized banks could be important issuers.", "The structure of covered bonds makes them attractive in today\u2019s environment because the investor has essentially two levels of protection. Covered bonds are senior debt obligations of the issuing institution secured directly on a portfolio of specific assets. The issuer is obligated to pay interest and principle on the bonds but for example, if the issuer defaults the assets in the covered asset pool also are available to repay the covered bond.", "Another opportunity for S&P is also emerging in structured finance. In the last eight years an estimated $25 trillion of securitized assets have been issued. The majority of these assets is still in the market and need to monitored, revalued, and priced for the trading in the secondary market. To tap this market potential S&P recently created Fixed Income Risk Management Services or the acronym using FIRMS under the direction of Lou Eccleston. ", "It will provide market intelligence and analytic insight for risk-driven investment analysis including debt, structured finance and the derivatives market.", "As this slide shows we have specific strategic initiatives for our target markets. The acquisition of IMAKE last year is the key to offering a new integrated credit risk modeling, surveillance and evaluation platform. We have already established the partnership with Super Derivatives to create the largest coverage of assets in a single offering and redesign and re-launching of RatingsDirect is on track for next January.", "Let me shift now and let\u2019s talk about the legal situation and a little bit of the regulatory situation as we see it right now. We recently won our first court decision related to subprime litigation. Last week the court dismissed the Blomquist action. This was suit was filed in California last August and it was alleging various state and federal claims against numerous financial institutions, government agencies, McGraw-Hill and individuals, including myself.", "Last May we filed a motion to dismiss all claims which was granted by the court on July 23rd. Significantly the court dismissed the case against us without giving the plaintiff the opportunity to amend the complaint. ", "A new suit was filed in July so there are now five that we\u2019re dealing with. The latest was filed in New York Supreme Court by Oddo Asset Management against essentially Barclays Bank but lots of others as well including ourselves. The suite alleges losses in two structured investment vehicles and the confirmation of allegedly false ratings by S&P. ", "In May and early June the New Jersey Carpenter Health and Vacation Fund filed three separate lawsuits against issuers, underwriters and a whole host of people including ourselves. These actions concern losses on mortgage backed securities and allegedly inappropriate credit ratings. ", "The class action suite filed last August in the District of Columbia is being moved to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs here seek damages relating to the decline in the value of McGraw Hill stock price. These are traditional stock drop type suits and it alleges because senior management allegedly failed to warn investors about problems in the structured market or in some of the products like S&P\u2019s, Residential Mortgage Backed Securities or CDO ratings.", "To wrap this up we believe all of the remaining suits are without merit and in our view the legal risk from these actions also remains low.", "S&P remains very actively engaged with all regulatory issues and is making progress on our intense commitment to a part of the solution. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working very closely with policymakers and market participants around the world to enable greater transparency and that is the most important thing in terms of helping to restore confidence in our markets.", "Separating the facts from the headlines is not easy in this environment. The level of activity increased substantially in June and July so let\u2019s review some of the recent developments. On June 5th S&P and two other ratings agencies announced agreements with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo; the focus was on the US residential mortgage backed securities. ", "As part of that undertaking there were no findings of wrongdoing. There were no payments and the New York Attorney General closed his investigation of the rating agencies. The agreement underscores our commitment and our strong, strong commitment to transparency, openness and the strengthening of the governance process.", "The SEC held two public meetings in June to discuss proposed new rules and regulations for NRSROs. On June 11 the SEC discussed a comprehensive set of rules that have the potential to bring more transparency to the structured market and this was including the additional disclosure, there was increased record keeping and strength in management of potential conflicts.", "The SEC put out these proposals for new rules and asked all market participants for public comment and they\u2019d like them back by July 25th. I\u2019ll summarize the comments that we submitted to the SEC in just a moment. The other one was on June 25 the SEC met to discuss the use of NRSRO ratings in its rules mainly the broker-dealer net capital rule and the money market fund investment rule. Comments to the SEC regarding these proposals are requested by September 5 and I\u2019ll also review these potential changes in just a moment.", "First I want to comment on the report issued by the SEC on July 8 after its comprehensive 10 month examination of the three ratings agencies. Amid all the news stories on the SEC report some critical conclusions got very scant attention. According to the SEC report no evidence was found by the SEC staff that decisions about ratings methodologies or models were based on attracting or losing market share.", "There was no indication that the rating agencies compensated analysts in a manner contrary to their policy. The SEC recognized the rating agencies enhanced their procedures in connection with their registration as NRSROs in 2007. The SEC report did note that further improvements can be made in the management of conflicts of interest.", "At the conclusion of the examination the SEC called for more documentation of the ratings process and recommended that S&P conduct reviews in certain areas. The S&P is committed to doing just that. S&P will be implementing these recommendations and taking steps to strengthen its ratings process accordingly. As you all know in the first half of this year we introduced 27 leadership actions in four categories. Those categories were governance, analytics, information and investor education.", "As I noted earlier S&P on July 24 responded to the SECs request for comments on its proposed rules. First I want to point out that S&P overall support the SEC proposals. We are committed to cooperating with the regulators and policymakers both here and abroad and we believe that the dialogue is extremely important. Also the policymakers and regulators think it\u2019s extremely important.", "They recognize that the issues are complex and merit this discussion and that\u2019s why the SEC asked for comments on the proposed rule. This is not a game of gotcha. It is all about transparency, openness and helping to restore confidence in our capital markets. That\u2019s the context for S&Ps response to the SEC on July 24. S&P responded to the SEC on two levels, commentary on the proposals itself and then observations on specific legal and related questions raised by the SEC staff.", "S&Ps goal was to be constructive and see clarifications where the proposals were not necessarily clear. We share the SECs desire to enhance investor understanding and address potential conflicts of interest in the current rating industry. At the same time we believe that any new SEC rules must be narrowly tailored as required by the law and should not regulate the substance of credit ratings or otherwise impair the value of rating agencies independent opinions.", "For example S&P fully supports the principle underlying the proposed rules that public rating decisions should be made broadly and publicly available. However, S&P also believes that is should be able to control how it disseminates its proprietary historical data and intellectual property. S&P agrees with the SEC that it should have policies and procedures that prevent it from structuring the products it rates. We already do that.", "We are concerned about the interference with the free flow of information between the rating agencies and their issuers. This is not a black box business and communications between rating agencies and issuers should be encouraged not inhibited. S&P also believes the costs of the proposed rules both for rating agencies and the market have been underestimated by the SEC and that\u2019s why S&P offered to share a detailed breakdown of its research on these matters with the SEC.", "These are some of the highlights from a 33 page letter S&P sent the SEC last week and if you have time and you\u2019re so inclined I hope you\u2019ll have a chance to read and it and you can access this letter at www.StandardandPoors.com. We look forward to working closely with the SEC and market participants so that any new regulations lend themselves to openness, transparency, market competition while remaining compatible with the existing law and regulation.", "The SEC is also seeking comment on rule changes affecting the use of ratings to meet capital requirements and I would observe that we didn\u2019t make the rules and believe we can continue to operate successfully if they\u2019re changed. We already do this outside the United States. We would be concerned if the proposed changes led to unintended disruption in financial markets.", "Soon we expect to see a draft of proposed regulations from the European Commission. In so far as European regulators may consider additional oversight of rating agencies we believe such steps would best be addressed through a globally coordinated approach recognizing the benefits of consistency for investors and issuers operating in international businesses. On this basis we will continue to communicate regularly with regulators around the world and we do that. ", "That\u2019s a lot of information on legal and regulatory but I wanted to make sure that you had a complete look at the current situation. To sum up we continue to believe that any new or currently proposed legislation, regulations or judicial determinations would not have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions or results of operation.", "Summing up for Financial Service, legal and regulatory risk remains low, double digit revenue growth for S&P Investment Services. Revenue for the segment could be off 7% to 9% of the year if the first half decline in structured finance continues for the remainder of the year. That would result in a 500 to 600 basis point drop in the operating margin again if the first half decline in structured finance continues for the remainder of the year.", "Moving over to Information and Media, growth in Business to Business products were key to the second quarter results at Information and Media. In the second quarter revenues increased 6.8%, operating profit improved by 68.2% and the operating margin was 9.3% compared to 5.9% for the same period last year.", "Revenue for the Business to Business Group grew by 7.8% even as advertising pages declined 11% at BusinessWeek in the second quarter. Strong global growth in Platt\u2019s news and pricing services and international and auto consulting growth at JD Power and Associates were the key factors in this segments second quarter performance.", "Platts is simply the company\u2019s most global product proportionately it does more business overseas than any other McGraw-Hill product or service. The demand for petroleum and natural gas products which shows now sign of diminishing in today\u2019s volatile energy markets is clearly benefiting Platts. Platts is expanding into new areas too. Steel is the world\u2019s third largest commodity. Platts just launched Steels Market Daily in 2006 and is working with market participants to bring price transparency to this market. ", "We continue to make progress in construction. The electronic delivery of our information is a critical part of the transition and is continuing to produce an increasing share of McGraw-Hill Constructions revenue.", "The advertising outlook at BusinessWeek is challenging. Ad pages through the issue of July 28 are off 17.3% and that\u2019s according to Publishers Information Bureau, PIB. At the same time BusinessWeek circulation is growing and new syndicated studies indicate that our audience is younger and more affluent than in years past.", "Revenue for McGraw-Hill Broadcasting Group was off by 1% in the second quarter. Declines in the base business primarily national offset our gains that we were able to record in political advertising. We expect overall political advertising to be a strong component in the second half. In August our Colorado stations will benefit from a state primary which includes contests for the US Senate and two House Representative Seats.", "This fall in California we expect the ballot to include at least 11 propositions, including a controversial same-sex marriage proposition. Of course all of our TV markets will benefit from the general election on November 4. Summing up for Information and Media obviously more progress this year, revenue growth of 6% to 8% and operating margin improvement.", "That wraps up our review of operations and looking ahead for the corporation it is clear that year over year comparisons get easier in the second half. Excluding second quarter restructuring charges and related benefits we still expect earnings per share in the $2.65 to $2.75 range for the full year.", "Let me hold it there and let me turn it over to Bob Bahash and he will go through the specific financials for you.", "Bob Bahash", "I\u2019ll begin with an update on our share repurchase program. We are approximately half was through our 15 million share repurchase target for 2008. In the second quarter we repurchased four million shares for a total cost of $170.8 million at an average price of $42.69 per share. That brings the first half repurchases to 7.4 million shares for total cost of $304.8 million at an average price of $41.19 per share. Twenty point six million shares remain in the 2007 program that was authorized by the Board of Directors.", "Net debt as of June 30 was $1.4 billion. This is up approximately $170 million from the end of the first quarter and is driven primarily by seasonal cash requirements as well as funding for share repurchases. As of June 30 on a gross basis total debt was $1.7 billion and is comprised of $1.2 billion of unsecured senior notes and $526 million in commercial paper outstanding. This is offset by $355 million in cash, primarily foreign holdings. ", "Due to the seasonality of the business debt levels tend to be higher in the first half of the year and for the later part of the year we are focused on maintaining debt levels comparable to year end 2007.", "Let\u2019s review the outlook for free cash flow. As I indicated in our first quarter earnings call we expect free cash flow this year to be approximately $600 million, prior to any acquisitions or share repurchases versus approximately $900 million in 2007. To calculate free cash flow we start with after tax cash from operations and deduct investments and dividends. What\u2019s left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt.", "Free cash flow for the first half of this year reflects a $319 million decline compared to the same period last year. The decline is due to reduced profits at Financial Services and the corresponding impact on working capital, an increase in working capital usage at McGraw-Hill Education as they prepare for the strong adoption opportunities, cash outflows for construction costs for the new data center that were accrued in 2007 and a one time shift in the timing of our employee profit sharing contribution from 2007 to 2008. ", "Additionally, the payment of the 2007 incentive compensation awards in the first quarter of 2008 negatively impacted 2008 cash flow. The cash savings from reduced 2008 compensation will not be realized until the awards are paid out in 2009. We had anticipated first half comparisons would be particularly challenging due to the factors I just mentioned. We generate the majority of our free cash flow in the second half of the year, primarily due to the seasonality of the education business.", "In the second half of 2008 we\u2019ll benefit from easier profit comparisons at Financial Services, reduced investments for purchases of property and equipment as the second half of 2007 reflected significant investments in our data center building, anticipated lower cash tax payments and normal seasonal working capital improvements. As a result we expect fee cash flow in the second half of this year to approximate free cash flow for the second half of 2007, resulting in $600 million for the full year as we had forecasted.", "Regarding net interest expense in the second quarter we had $20 million compared to $12 million in the same period last year an $8 million increase. We continue to expect it to be in the range of $75 to $85 million for 2008. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter was 321.1 million shares a 29.2 million share decrease compared to the second quarter of 2007 and a 2.3 million share decrease compared to the first quarter of 2008.", "Corporate expenses were $33.5 million in the second quarter a $7.5 million or 18% decrease versus the same period last year. This is primarily driven by reduced incentive compensation accruals as well as stringent expense controls. For 2008 we still expect the mid single digit decrease in corporate expenses.", "I\u2019d like to take a few moments to discuss expense growth at Financial Services and McGraw-Hill Education in the second quarter. At Financial Services expenses in the second quarter increased $17 million or 4%. Excluding the $15 million second quarter restructuring charge expenses were essentially flat compared to the same period a year ago with growth of just 0.4% or $1.5 million.", "This year over year expense comparison benefits from a $30 million reduction in incentive compensation and savings from the fourth quarter 2007 restructuring actions. These expense savings were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions made in 2007 and 2008 the impact of weakening US dollar on non-US dollar expense and investments in fast growing areas such as CRISIL, Capital IQ and Index Services.", "Financial Services sequential second quarter expenses increased $52 million or 13.5% versus the first quarter. The primarily contributors to this expense increase are the previously announced restructuring charges of $15 million, a $20 million increase in incentive compensation provision versus the very depressed first quarter levels and a $17 million increase in broad expense categories for our strong growth businesses for example, Capital IQ, Index Services and CRISIL.", "Expenses at McGraw-Hill Education increased 6.1% in the second quarter. Adjusted for the second quarter restructuring charge expenses grew $26 million or 4.6%. The increase is driven by $9 million in higher pre-publication costs, increased marketing costs related to the strong state new adoption market opportunities as well as investments in technology, including $3 million in data center migration costs.", "These increases were partially mitigated by benefits from the fourth quarter 2007 restructuring and reduced stock based compensation. Benefits from the second quarter restructuring will be largely realized in the second half of the year.", "I\u2019d like to provide an update on the migration of our digital products and services to the new data center, a key effort as we increasingly deliver products and services electronically. The migration is going very well. In the second quarter the migration cost was $9 million. For the first half it was $13 million. We continue to expect that overall costs will be about $40 million for 2008. McGraw-Hill Education represents $18 million or almost half of those costs as this segment continues to deliver more digital content and services.", "I\u2019ll now review unearned revenue which was $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter that reflects a 7.5% year over year increase. Financial Services represents approximately three quarters of unearned revenue and experienced growth of 12%. This growth was partially offset by a reduction at McGraw-Hill Education due to accelerated fulfillment of orders for basal tests and related components including increased use of electronic delivery.", "For 2008 we continue to expect unearned revenue growth will be in the mid single digit range compared to last year given the forecast for slower revenue growth at Financial Services. In terms of our effective tax rate we expect the rate to be 37.5% in 2008 approximately the same as 2007 on a full year basis.", "Let\u2019s now look at capital expenditures which include pre-publication investment and purchases of property and equipment. In the second quarter our pre-publication investments were $65 million compared to $75 million in the same period last year. We firmed up our estimates and now expect $270 million for 2008 versus the previous projection of $290 million that we provided during the first quarter earnings call.", "Purchases of property and equipment were $25 million in the second quarter compared to $61 million in the same period last year. This was higher last year while we were building the data center but we\u2019ve returned to a more normalized rate this quarter. For 2008 we continue to project $160 million for CapEx. This includes normal replacement expenditures, additional purchases of software and technology equipment for the new data center and continued investments in technology.", "Finally, now non-cash items, amortization of pre-publication costs was $66 million compared to $57 million last year. For 2008 we\u2019re lowering our guidance to $275 million. This represents a $35 million increase versus 2007 and is driven by significant pre-publication investments to take advantage of opportunities in the el-hi market.", "Deprecation was $30 million compared to $29 million in the same period last year. We still expect it to be about $125 million for the year, reflecting completion of the data center, the purchase of new technology equipment for the data center and other general increases in capital expenditures. Amortization of intangibles was $13 million compared to $11.5 million in the same period last year. For 2008 we continue to expect approximately $52 million.", "Terry McGraw", "As we came into this year we knew this was going to be a first half second half kind of year. We\u2019re pleased with the performance given some of the difficulty in the market, obviously with continued uncertainty in financial markets and some of the economic conditions still existing. Year over year comparisons obviously get easier for us in the second half. We\u2019re pleased that there\u2019s no change in our full year earnings forecast.", "There are a number of focuses here, obviously with the assessment of legal and regulatory risks being lower but our commitment to our share repurchase program and our commitment to cost containment are imperative in this. With that let me turn it back to Don Rubin and let\u2019s go to any question or comments that you may have.", "Donald Rubin", "We will now take the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Peter Appert \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "A couple questions on the S&P business. First the SEC is very proactive in terms of trying to bring more players in to the ratings industry. Can you give you thoughts on how the competitive dynamics in the market are changing and whether specifically seeing any implication in terms of price?", "Terry McGraw", "Really no, what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, we\u2019re seeing some nice growth in the corporate and government side of ratings. Also in the public finance side but obviously the extreme weakness on the structured finance new issuance is the issue there. In terms of the activities that we have its pretty much market as usual, it\u2019s the same players in that part. Again, we\u2019re really fairly early on in some of the uncertain conditions. Therefore I wouldn\u2019t expect to see that kind of new participation at this point.", "What we\u2019re working on is ourselves and making sure that we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can. I mentioned the 27 leadership actions get higher transparency in all of those kinds of things. No impact from increased competition.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Have you done anything on pricing this year at S&P?", "Terry McGraw", "Nothing differently, in terms of pricing mechanisms it\u2019s pretty straight forward in terms of whether it\u2019s a very complex instrument or less complex instrument. We have not changed any of our pricing policies.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Year to year have you made price increases?", "Terry McGraw", "In areas where there is activity normal increases obviously with the weakness in structured finance that\u2019s a very different issue.", "Bob Bahash", "On average price increases have been in the range of 2% to 3% in areas that we\u2019ve increased price.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "What should we look for in terms of year to year expense trends in the second half within the Financial Services business typically I\u2019m thinking you get the benefit of the productions but is that fully offset by incentive comp comparisons getting tougher in the fourth quarter?", "Bob Bahash", "The incentive comp comparisons will be a bit more difficult because as you may recall last year we were adjusting incentive comp accruals in the third quarter and more dramatically in the fourth quarter so that will certainly have an impact. The Financial Services team is very focused on maintaining costs contingencies very strict containment of the overall cost side on the credit market services side. ", "I do want to emphasize that we continue to invest in those investment services business that has been growing at 20% we expect the growth rate we\u2019re not really projecting growth rates for the second half of the year but we\u2019ll be very, very strong and robust. We\u2019re going to continue to make those investments in those areas. We are benefiting and will be benefiting from those restructuring actions. ", "I think you\u2019re going to look for continuing trend from what we saw on a sequential basis first quarter to second quarter going out for the next couple quarters this year.", "Terry McGraw", "It really is a tale of two cities, in those areas that there\u2019s activity, there\u2019s growth, we are not cutting back there obviously. In fact we\u2019re pushing very aggressively to make sure that market penetration and share are factors there. Corporate governments and public finance are doing well and we\u2019re seeing some strength in the asset backed market as we were talking. The mortgage loan market is obviously impacted and you\u2019ll see continued cost containment. The investment services side is doing very well. It will be dependent upon activity levels.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "You mentioned similar sequential patterns [inaudible] for the first to second you saw fairly significant increase in costs do we look for costs to be up fairly meaningfully then in the second half?", "Bob Bahash", "The increase in the second quarter on a sequential basis there were really three items. One was the restructuring amount roughly $15 million, the other was an increase on a quarter to quarter basis of about $20 million for incentive compensation. When we completed the first quarter we were really taking that run rate going out for the balance of the year and to maintain a very low level for incentive compensation. ", "Not that we\u2019ve seen a big increase but we see a little bit of light especially the continuation of benefits from investment services side. As a result the accrual rate for the incentive compensation increased by $20 million on a quarter to quarter basis. Then there was basically about $17 million of investments added for those growth businesses. That\u2019s why I say we\u2019ve got the costs controlled for those areas that we want to control and we\u2019re making investments for those areas that we need to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "In light of your second quarter performance can you discuss maintaining your $2.65 to $2.75 EPS guidance for the full year excluding restructuring charges? Are you just trying to be conservative here to see how things play out the remaining six months why you haven\u2019t raised that?", "Terry McGraw", "The first half had a lot of uncertainty to it we\u2019re seeing a different second half comparisons should definitely be easier we\u2019ve got an education quarter in the third quarter and so forth. There\u2019s a fair bit of uncertainty in the market about how things are going to come back, what will come back, when it will come back and all those kind of things. The guidance that we\u2019ve given is very appropriate for the conditions. If that changes so will we. At this point the $2.65 to $2.75 is a good range to adhere to.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in July in Financial Services across the various categories, any significant change there versus what you saw in the second quarter?", "Terry McGraw", "Obviously the second quarter was still impacted significantly. What we have seen is some pick up in the structured finance area in the asset backed area. We\u2019ve also seen some increases on the corporate and governments side in terms of investment grade issuance on that one. We are in the middle of a credit crunch and we have to see that on the mind and the uncertainty on timing is certainly there.", "Hopefully things start to relax a little bit and we start getting back to a growth mode. I do think that notwithstanding the comments that David Wyss made as our Chief Economist that I think we benefited from the stimulus package and we still have a fourth and first quarter of next year that will probably be negative and then we\u2019ll start to see some low slow growth. The capital markets will reflect some of those conditions.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Asia, was that about roughly 10% of your ratings revenues in the quarter? The other part of the question is how do Asia new issuances do for your company in the second quarter?", "Terry McGraw", "Breaking out issuance and the like, these are cross border securities and we don\u2019t break out exactly what issue pertains to, which region. The Asia region obviously is a very important region to us and we\u2019ll only get more so going forward. It\u2019s still the United States and Europe are the largest components of that but increasingly the Middle East and Central, Eastern Europe are going to become as important as some of the Asian markets. The lions share is in the developed countries.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Is that to say that Asia held up much better than you US and Europe in the second quarter?", "Terry McGraw", "The Asia markets are feeling less of the capital market retraction than the developed countries.", "Bob Bahash", "Especially when you included Asia which we of course naturally do CRISIL which continues to show very strong growth. Asia in terms of the regions, one its third as Terry pointed out, and it\u2019s US, UK Europe then Asia. Asia did hold up better because they were not plagued with the level of some of the structured products that the other to markets were.", "Terry McGraw", "Increasingly going forward longer term the Asian markets are going to be critical to our growth patterns.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Two clarifications please on S&P, I think Craig had asked is there any change in business tone in July relative to Q2, I\u2019m wondering on the transaction side. Terry is that where your comments were saying when you talked about investment grade picking up and asset backed picking up in July?", "Terry McGraw", "Exactly, we saw some in the early part of the second quarter. As I think some corporate treasurer taking advantage of the fact that they had the ability to get into the market. Yes, we\u2019re starting to see some pick up on the corporate and government side. We are pleased by the pick up on the public finance side which we hadn\u2019t expected a little bit. The asset backed I think is signs that parts of the structured market are starting to come back but again its going to be bias against speculative and to a flight to quality.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "On the non-transaction relationship revenue that was up big sequentially, it was up $30 million. Can you talk about that\u2019s a lot of extra relationship there what was driving that, was that mostly research or what\u2019s in that number the big jump in the quarter.", "Terry McGraw", "It\u2019s a lot of thing but most important its surveillance fees. There are a lot of relationship fees here and surveillance fees. People forget that there\u2019s been a pull back in the new issuance of structured finance but you\u2019ve got about $35 trillion rated structured finance product in the market that\u2019s doing well. It needs to be monitored and surveyed and we have relationship fees on that. That relates to the deferred revenue.", "Bob Bahash", "In addition to relationship fees there are very significant credit information products such as RatingsDirect and products like that which have experienced rather dramatic growth. They account for a good portion of that increase as well.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Peter had asked a question about the expense trend and I still don\u2019t understand the answer. Expenses excluding the charge were up $35 million versus Q1 are you expecting that type of increase to persist in Q3 and Q4, can you clarify your comments?", "Bob Bahash", "Yes, of the $35 million, $20 million was incentive compensation so depending upon how the year progresses both for the ratings side and the information side that will dictate the level of incentive compensation accruals going forward. If you separate out incentive compensation, what I\u2019m trying to say here is incentive compensation is going to be driven by the overall performance of the business. ", "Separating out incentive compensation the core expenses for people, physical locations, etc is maintained in very, very tight control pretty much a very modest increase for credit market services. The only areas where you\u2019re seeing some increases and appreciable increases would be on the investment services side. That was the clarification. Trying to separate out the incentive compensation which is going to be affected by the overall performance of the business and keep the response to the core expenses that we\u2019re managing on a day to day basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Co.", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Co.", "On migration costs do they disappear mostly in \u201909 or is there some kind of carry over on the migration numbers?", "Bob Bahash", "The migration costs the plan right now is that we will go into the first quarter of 2009 and hopefully by that time we\u2019ll have completed almost the entire migration. There\u2019s a possibility we might step that up and have some of the applications that were planned for the first quarter move in the fourth quarter of this year. The specific answer to the question, at most we will have one quarters worth of migration costs in 2009 that being the first quarter then it\u2019s gone.", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Co.", "What are the actual shares at the end of the second quarter? Not the average, the actual.", "Bob Bahash", "Do you want basic or diluted?", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Co.", "Both.", "Bob Bahash", "Basic is 317.6 million shares, and fully diluted 319 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "Just a clarification on your regulatory comments you indicated that you think the SEC doesn\u2019t quite realize the extent of the costs involved with some of what they\u2019re asking for. Does that differ from your comments about not seeing regulatory or legal issues actually impacting your financials or would that actually be an increased cost and a crunch on margins?", "Terry McGraw", "All costs and all estimates of regulatory and compliance are in the numbers that we have here. We\u2019re talking about new rule changes that the SEC is posing for US issued securities. This is a comment letter, this is a letter that they sent out to all market participants and asked for comments. We\u2019re saying that we work very, very well with the SEC and we both have the same objective of bringing more transparency and confidence restoration back into the markets. We talked about a lot of the leadership changes that we\u2019re taking and with them on this. ", "There\u2019s a point where you\u2019ve got to be careful and one of the comments that we are making between open market behaviors and market regulation. You want to construct a balance here you don\u2019t want to get unintended consequences and costs. We just want to make sure that in terms of our reflection on the new rules that we\u2019re trying to strike that balance in the market and that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "A follow up on the indices it looks like there was a slight sequential increase in revenue from indexes. Was this primarily due to new ETS that are being formed and could you also speak a little bit to how those fees are charged and collected is it on a monthly basis and is this calculated on a monthly basis so none of these fees are in deferred.", "Terry McGraw", "Obviously on a monthly basis we record all that again it depends on when the various new indices are launched. As I was saying in my remarks that the activity in the first half has been extraordinary and the receptivity for these products worldwide are really good. We have been very aggressive in pushing these out and we\u2019ll continue. Last year was a very strong year for indices and we\u2019re at a pace at the end of the first half that is pushing the full year 2007. We\u2019re very pleased with this kind of product and the receptivity of the product and we\u2019ll continue to be aggressive in pursuing it.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "Can you comment on the margins for that business?", "Terry McGraw", "High. We don\u2019t break it out but those are terrific businesses. The most important thing is making sure that you\u2019re being very responsive to various investor constituents and that you\u2019re coming out with product that they want to be able to utilize and develop on. If you\u2019re doing so those are very, very nice businesses.", "Bob Bahash", "A clarification on the question you asked are they deferred revenue. There are various different relationships that we have only a very small amount is in deferred revenue. Less than 5% of the Financial Services deferred revenue would relate to index services so a relatively modest amount.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "My last question is regarding the non-transaction revenue. Have you been finding new corporate relationships? You mentioned that most of the increase in deferred is surveillance fees coming on but are there any new corporate relationships at this time or not really?", "Bob Bahash", "For new investment grade issuers there would be but it\u2019s not significant at this point in time.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "I did have a question about Education. Can you talk a little bit further about why you lowered your guidance slightly for this year and then also for the adoption market for 2009 the past you\u2019ve thought it would be $850 to $900 million market for 2009 is that still the case from your vantage point?", "Terry McGraw", "The guidance for 2009 in terms of the new adoption market is unchanged. In terms of the revenue projections the K-12 market is obviously off to really good start. We\u2019re very pleased in the projection of 33% market capture would be a very good number. We\u2019re very, very pleased with reading in Florida and California with science. That\u2019s doing very well. ", "We want to watch that open territory and we still have that at 1% to 2% and what we\u2019re seeing is strength in some of the Southern states and in come of the Southwestern states and we\u2019re seeing some conservatism in the Northeast and Central states. There\u2019s a mix here that\u2019s going on. We\u2019re going to hold the 1% to 2% but we\u2019re hoping to see that better. We\u2019ll know more towards the end of August and into September on that part.", "On Higher Education July/August as you know from a timing standpoint is a 60 day month, where you see the increases. We\u2019re seeing it as a little bit softer than what we had expected but we have to see what August does and so we\u2019re monitoring that carefully. I think it\u2019s just prudent to say 4% to 6% is a better number right now. We hope to be at the upper end. Given where we are right now 4% to 6% are good numbers.", "Operator", "That does conclude this morning\u2019s call.

(Operator instructions) I would now like to introduce Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for McGraw-Hill Companies. Sir you may begin.", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you and good morning to our worldwide audience and thank everyone for joining us at The McGraw-Hill Companies fourth quarter earnings call. I\u2019m Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at the McGraw-Hill Companies. With me this morning are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO, and Robert Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning the company issued a news release with our fourth quarter 2008 results. We trust you have all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com. Once again that is www.mcgraw-hill.com.

After the presentation, we will open the meeting to questions and answers. It's now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President, and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Harold McGraw III", "Okay. Thank you very much Don and good morning to everyone and welcome to our review of the full year and fourth quarter earnings and the outlook for 2009. With me is Bob Bahash, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "On today\u2019s call we will be providing information on our performance in 2008 and discuss our guidance for 2009. After my review of operations Bob will then provide a little bit more in-depth look at our strong financial condition as well as our outlook for free cash flow for 2009 and obviously after that we will take questions and comments and go in any direction you would like.", "As Don said earlier this morning we announced results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. I\u2019m very pleased to report that we delivered on the high end of our guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Let us briefly recap those results.", "For 2008, we reported 2008 diluted earnings per diluted share of $2.51 and that of course includes a $0.14 per share restructuring charge. Also revenue declined 6.2%.", "For the fourth quarter of 2008, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.37 and that included a $0.05 per share restructuring charge. Revenue declined by 9.8%. To help control expenses we reduced incentive compensation in 2008 by $273.7 million. The restructuring actions in 2008 resulted in a workforce reduction of 1045 positions.", "Cost containment was a priority for us in 2008. And it\u2019ll be the same again for this year. If more actions are necessary this year we\u2019re prepared to take them. The challenge in the current environment is obviously is to manage for today while preparing for tomorrow. We will and we still must see how the massive recovery package coming from the Federal government will first one, stimulate the economy; second, relieve budget pressures on state and local government; three, help educational funding; and four, improve the sentiment in capital markets.", "Slower economic growth and the weakened housing sector will affect the state and local tax base. At the same time, the demand for local government supported projects may lead to more debt financing. We\u2019ve seen this trend before. Historically there is a clear inverse correlation between state and local operating balances and municipal debt issuance.", "The changing financial landscape is both a source of new challenges and new opportunities. While circumstances are favorable, we have responded by investing in fast growing businesses at Standard & Poor\u2019s, the confluence again of content, technology, and distribution is also creating opportunities to improve our potential by producing new digital products and services. For an audience eager to acquire 21st century skills, we\u2019re doing so to maintain our leadership. In this environment we must also preserve and protect a very strong balance sheet.", "A strong balance sheet has been the hallmark of this company and we plan to keep it that way. Our cash flow is more than sufficient to meet our requirements for operations, making investments, paying down debt, and returning cash to shareholders. We have paid a dividend every year since 1937. And we have increased it every year since 1974. That is 35 years of increasing the dividend. Few companies can match that record of consistency.", "The next decision on the cash dividend will be made tomorrow at the board of directors regular monthly meeting and believe me, our board understands the importance here.", "With that background let us review the operations and then 2009 guidance for each segment. And let us begin with Financial Services.", "A resilient and diverse portfolio helped cushion the Financial Services segment in the midst of a credit crunch and very challenging comparisons with a very robust 2007. Revenue for S&P Credit Market Services in 2008 declined by 22.5% and by 24.5% in the fourth quarter.", "Revenue for S&P Investment Services that is our non ratings business grew by 15% last year and by 7% in the fourth quarter. In 2007, S&P Investment Services produced about 26% of Financial Services revenue. In 2008 it rose to 34% of the total. Revenue for this segment declined by 12.9% for 2008 and by 15.4% in the fourth quarter.", "In the face of adverse market conditions we continued to manage our costs diligently. After pre-tax restructuring charges of $25.9 million for a workforce reduction of approximately 340 positions and a $166.0 million decrease in incentive compensation, operating profit declined 22.4% in 2008.", "In the fourth quarter, after a pre-tax restructuring charge of $6.6 million for a workforce reduction of approximately 50 positions and a reduction of $36.6 million in incentive compensation, operating profit declined 18.6%. All that effort enabled us to report a 39.8% operating margin for the year and a 34.4% operating margin in the fourth quarter.", "The restructuring charges reduced the 2008 operating margin by 98 basis points for 2008 and by 105 basis points in the fourth quarter. The decline in new issue volume obviously had a major impact on 2008 results. As these bar charts illustrate, the decline in the U.S. structured finance new issuance dollar volume was pronounced all year. For 2008 U.S. structured finance new issuance dollar volume was off 79.9% and the weakest in the fourth quarter with an 89.4% decline.", "Now corporate and public finance issuance fared better. U.S. corporate dollar volume issuance was up 33.8% for the year as the high-yield market dropped by 73.7%. In the fourth quarter U.S. corporate dollar volume issuance was down 39.3% as the high-yield market came to a virtual halt dropping by 96.3%. But while the new issue dollar volume last year was the weakest in the fourth quarter it is not the whole story for Standard & Poor\u2019s.", "As this table illustrates, the revenue performance for the segment and S&P Credit Markets Services did not come close to matching the fourth quarter decline in the U.S. or the global new issue dollar volume. A key to our resiliency in the ratings business is the non-transaction revenue. And that number grew by 5.2% in 2008 and represented 73.1% of S&P Credit Market Services revenue. In the fourth quarter, non-transaction revenue declined by 4.8% and accounted for 78.9% of rating revenue.", "About 90% of the non-transaction revenue is reoccurring. And as you all know it comes from surveillance fees, annual contracts, subscriptions and so forth and the recurring \u2013 the reoccurring portion grew all year. Our non-transaction revenue also includes other services such as bank loan ratings, which are not reflected in the public bond issuance. A sharp decline in bank loan ratings was the key factor in the fourth quarter decline in non-transaction revenue.", "We expect non-transaction revenue to grow in 2009. It\u2019ll be helped by modest price increases, the majority of annually renewable contracts are with large investment grade companies, financial institutions, governments, and government related entities. These entities will continue to access the public debt markets.", "Our subscription services, this would be RatingsDirect and RatingsXpress, provide vital information and this month we increased their value as a global credit portal to the market with major enhancements. Given all the uncertainty of current market conditions the outlook for transaction revenue is very hard to call. To be clear, we define transaction revenue as the new public issuance of corporate, public finance, and structured finance instruments. We expect new issuance to get off to a slower start this year but anticipate a better run rate in 2009 then we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008. Still we don\u2019t expect growth in new issuance in 2009. At best we think it could possibly be flat.", "Spreads remain a key gain factor in S&P\u2019s market. Firms are deleveraging and rationalizing balance sheets but a more substantial contraction in spreads probably won\u2019t materialize until investors see clear signs that deleveraging has run its course. There are positive signs. Various Federal initiatives designed to improve liquidity have had some success at the short end of the market. That is a critical first step for spreads to tighten for long-term credit. Based on what issuers and investors are telling us, there are indications of pent up demand in the investment grade market. LIBOR spreads are the key cost of funds benchmark. So we\u2019re watching them very closely. The rate has come down sharply in recent weeks and the three month LIBOR is currently approximately 1.15%.", "A declining LIBOR rate obviously is an indication of lower perceived risk in the banking industry and helps facilitate more interbank lending, which is something that we need to see. We\u2019re also looking for narrowing spreads on credit default swaps and improvement in spreads for both investment grade as well as in high-yield bonds. Stabilization of the housing market would be a big plus for everyone. Home prices on average have fallen 21% since July of 2006 and that is according to the Standard and Poor\u2019s/Case-Schiller 20-city index and there is probably more to go. S&P\u2019s chief economist, David Wyss, expects housing prices to bottom out probably around 30% peak to drop [ph] by the end of this year.", "For S&P Investment Services tough comparisons. Revenue grew by 15.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007 and consolidations in the financial markets were factors in the lower rate of growth in the fourth quarter than in previous three quarters of 2008. Probably another factor here is the assets under management and exchange traded funds hit an all-time high of $235 billion at the end of 2007 and declined to $203.6 billion at the end of 2008, but a good year nonetheless.", "Still we look forward for more improvement this year in our non-ratings business. In one of the worst years for equities since the 1930s our Index Services turned in an outstanding performance. We benefited from market volatility, which produced increased trading volume at derivatives based on S&P indices. In the fourth quarter alone there was nearly a 47% increase in the average daily volume on major exchange traded derivatives and these are all based on our indices. For more \u2013 more than 4.1 million contracts were traded daily in the fourth quarter of 2008 and that is versus just over 2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and of course Standard & Poor\u2019s is paid every time a contract is traded.", "Assets under management and exchange traded funds based on S&P indices declined year-over-year by 13.5% but we also saw new inflows to exchange traded funds creating a substantial increase in the number of shares invested in ETFs. That is a very positive development. We have also seen greater use of exchange traded funds as hedging tools.", "We continue to find new opportunities to expand this market. In the fourth quarter 14 new exchange traded funds based on the S&P indices were introduced. For the year, 59 exchange traded funds were launched. There are now 203 exchange traded funds based on S&P indices and there is more in the pipeline.", "New products, the growth in shares outstanding in ETS based on our indices, and the increasing diversity of our offerings should benefit us again in 2009. Despite the contraction in Wall Street, we continue to make progress with Capital IQ. Very pleased to hear, finishing the year with a client base of over 2600, a 19% increase for the year. At the end of the month, Capital IQ will add new data in functionality enhancements and a new portfolio attribution tool to combat the cutbacks and consolidation among financial firms, a key part of Capital IQ\u2019s strategy is to add value with this new data offering and this improved functionality.", "With litigation about S&P ratings in the news there was some confusion earlier this month when the European commission announced it was opening up formal proceedings with Standard & Poor\u2019s and the matter raised some questions. So let me clarify that situation. First, the proceedings have nothing to do with ratings. Secondly, is that we are not dealing with a lawsuit or anything like that. It is only a review regarding our licensing practices. And third, the proceedings involved compliance against the CUSIP Service Bureau, which S&P operates on behalf of the American Bankers association. And as many of you know, CUSIP is the acronym for the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures. This system started in 1968 when the American Bankers Association appointed Standard & Poor\u2019s to develop and administer a system for uniquely identifying each U.S. stock and bond with a permanent nine digit code to facilitate the smooth settlement and clearance of security transactions.", "For 30 years the CUSIP Service Bureau has been licensing commercial databases containing CUSIP numbers and associated descriptive data. Financial institutions seek access to these databases for a wide array of services purposes that go far beyond the clearance and settlement activities. So last summer the European Commission received a complaint from several associations representing financial institutions and asset managers that the CUSIP Service Bureau was allegedly abusing its position in the European market by requiring license fees for use in access to the CUSIP Service Bureau\u2019s database of 12-digit ISIN numbers, which are derived from CUSIP and associated data.", "They challenged the legal right of CUSIP Service Bureau to control access to its valuable and proprietary databases. These institutions wanted free access. In essence, the dispute is not about access to ISIN numbers for their primary purpose of settlement of cross border security transactions. These identifiers are available to market participants free of charge. Rather these Europeans have developed other uses for these identifiers such as the management of internal databases and demand free access for our commercial databases. The complaint is without merit. It misrepresents the licensing activities of the CUSIP Service Bureau and ignores the fact that our licensing practices and charges [ph] are wholly transparent and in line with industry practices.", "There also is a new shareholder derivative lawsuit. As a shareholder the Teamsters Allied Benefit Funds is suing the board of directors and some corporate executives. The faulty premise of this complaint is that our Board of Directors and corporate executives allegedly knew there were problems with ratings, followed by purported misstatements in public filings on the results and operations of the S&P ratings business and again this suit is totally without merit.", "On the regulatory front, there is more work to be done here and the outreach to key policy makers, regulators, politicians here and literally around the world is an ongoing process and we are very active here. In Europe we\u2019re meeting with European members\u2019 states and members of the European Parliament. We are participating in member states and pan-European meetings, Finance Ministers, Central Bank supervisors are all on the itinerary. In the United States, we are awaiting the publication of final NRSRO rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission. S&P continues to discuss global regulatory developments with the SEC and that is an ongoing issue. We believe that smart regulation will help strengthen financial markets and S&P is working very hard to be an integral part of that solution.", "In this environment we also continue to strengthen our organization as a part of the leadership actions we appointed an ombudsman for Standard & Poor\u2019s Credit Market Services effective February 16th. Ray Groves will be S&P\u2019s first ombudsman. He was with Ernst & Young for 37 years. He served as the firm\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for 17 years until his retirement in 1994. The ombudsman will address concerns about conflicts of interest in analytical and governance issues raised inside and outside the company. The ombudsman reports directly to me and has accountability to the audit committee of the Board of Directors. He will also report annually to the public.", "Now, many ideas have been suggested about the regulation of rating agencies and we think they should be thoroughly obviously explored. Managing the potential for conflicts of interest in the ratings process is a key issue, we agree. We have always agreed to that. We also believe that no system is completely free of conflict. But we do believe that conflict can and should be managed through greater transparency. In fact the key issue for financial markets is transparency. That is why Standard & Poor\u2019s has taken 27 leadership actions. These are action steps to improve its process and procedures and that is forever an ongoing process. That is the reason for creating the office of the ombudsman and that is why Standard & Poor\u2019s makes its ratings available at no charge to the market and in real time.", "And because S&P\u2019s opinions are freely available to everyone the market is free to assess our decisions and our business model makes this transparency possible.", "Okay let us sum up then for the Financial Services segment. Growth in non-transaction revenue will help cushion the uncertainty in the new issue market in 2009 and we may start to see some pickup in new issuance especially in the second half. Growth in S&P Investment Services will continue and a slower start to 2009. Our guidance for 2009 for the Financial Services segment is low single digit revenue probably about 1.5% to 2% growth and a margin decline of 250 basis points to 300 basis points and that is excluding the 2008 restructuring charges.", "Okay, let\u2019s now take a look at McGraw-Hill Education. Gains in the U.S. higher education partially offset a decline in the elementary-high school market in 2008. The McGraw-Hill School Education Group\u2019s revenue decreased by 5.4% in 2008 and by 18.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 2007.", "McGraw-Hill higher education, professional and international group\u2019s revenue increased by 1% in 2008 and declined by 2% in the fourth quarter. This group accounted for 48% of the entire segment revenue in 2008. Revenue for this segment declined by 2.5% for the year and 8% in the fourth quarter. Cost cutting was a priority for this segment as market conditions softened during the year. Including pre-tax restructuring charges of $25.3 million for a workforce reduction of approximately 455 positions and a $29.3 million decrease in incentive compensation, operating profits declined by 20.9% in 2008.", "In the fourth quarter including a pre-tax restructuring charge of $11.4 million for a workforce reduction of approximately 215 positions and a $7.8 million decline in incentive compensation this segment had an operating loss of $14.3 million.", "The operating margin for 2008 was 12%. The restructuring charge reduced the operating margin for the year by 96 basis points.", "For the most part, the fourth quarter in education is not seasonally significant except in some years for the U.S. College and university business. December is traditionally the key month of the fourth quarter for higher education and that certainly proved true again in 2008.", "A late surge in sales enabled higher education to finish the year on an upswing and in a good position for 2009. Still we didn\u2019t quite match the U.S. college markets\u2019 estimated 3% sales gain in 2008. Our performance in 2008 resulted primarily from the fact that we published fewer major titles in 2008 than we did in 2007. With a more robust list for the New Year, we expect to stay in step with the industry in 2009. We also will benefit from a growing lineup of new digital offerings that include individualized online tutoring, a lecture capture service that gives students access to course critical lectures, and an assessment placement tool to build that enables schools to determine the most appropriate courses for entering students and that we are developing off of our (inaudible) artificial intelligence base capability.", "For 2009, we\u2019ve also launched a new generation of homework managers. Already our best selling digital product line in the higher education market, these subject-specific platforms allow instructors to organize all of their course assignments, and add their assessments for online use by students. Our robust new platform, which we\u2019re calling McGraw-Hill Connect, offers many more features for both faculty and students. Available initially for 12 different disciplines the McGraw-Hill Connect product line will be promoting \u2013 be promoted with a tag line; connect, learn, and succeed.", "At year end we also had 741 titles live on CourseSmart, that is the industry\u2019s e-book web site. And we think the college and universities sales market could grow 3% to 4% in 2009. Historically higher education has been a countercyclical market during economic downturns post-secondary enrollments tend to increase as unemployed workers return to school to upgrade their skills and current students remain in school longer to become more competitive in a tight job market.", "Our sales of professional books were hurt by weakness at the retail as consumers cut back spending. In 2009, we will be launching key titles in the scientific, technical, and medical market which are less vulnerable to economic downturns than the general retail market. Our digital products and services enjoyed solid growth in 2008 and we will continue to build on that success in 2009.", "In the first quarter, we will launch three major new digital projects for professionals; JAMAevidence, access anesthesiology [ph], and access engineering [ph]. Very quickly on those three, JAMAevidence, it was developed jointly with the Journal of the American Medical Association. It provides subscribers with the fundamental tools for applying the medical literature to clinical diagnosis. It also includes a full text access to two of our major references, the Users' Guides to the Medical Literature and the newly published Rational Clinical Examination.", "Access anesthesiology is a comprehensive online resource covering pain management, critical care, and perioperative medicine. It takes the subscriber from the reference desk into the anesthesiologist\u2019s workflow.", "Access engineering features fully searchable content from hundreds of our publications including such classics as Perry's Chemical Engineering \u2013 Engineers' Handbook. Users can customize access engineering for their own projects and for their own individual studies. What I am really describing are outstanding examples of the convergence again of content and technology. It takes knowledge, creativity, and innovation to leverage our content and create such products. Professionals around the world recognize the value proposition because they require 21st century skills to succeed. That is why our digital products are growing globally and at a very good pace. We\u2019re seeing a steady increase in new subscriptions from around the world and the renewals a strong. We also expect more growth overseas in higher education and professional markets.", "The challenge in 2009 obviously will be the elementary-high school market, where we now anticipate, and we\u2019ll have to see, but we now anticipate a 10% to 15% decline in the industry sales after a decrease of approximately 4% in 2008. It is a market in which we capture approximately 30% of available state new adoption dollars. That market topped $980 million, exceeding our earlier projections of $925 million to $950 million.", "In 2009, the state new adoption calendar is simply not as robust. The upturn in state new adoption starts in 2010 and carries into 2011. We currently estimate the 2009 state new adoption market at $675 million to $725 million down from an earlier estimate of $850 million to $900 million.", "State and local budgets are obviously under pressure and funding concerns could affect the outlook in two of this year\u2019s key adoption states, California and Florida. Both states are grappling with deficits that could affect the purchase of instructional materials. Florida has already eliminated the call for a K-12 Music Adoption. Only the 6-12 literature adoption will be funded this year. And many districts may elect to postpone purchasing until next year or even 2011. We just don\u2019t know.", "We have a strong program entered in the California K-5 reading [ph] market this year, appropriately the program is called California Treasures. We also are very well positioned for the second year of the math adoption in California particularly with the Los Angeles Unified School District. But here too there is budget pressure and the situation is highly fluid.", "The budget pressures are also evident in our testing business. Revenue for custom contracts was off for the year and the fourth quarter as well due to lower volume of work on several contracts and the discontinuation of two contracts that produced income in 2008. Replacing that revenue with newer expanded contract work became increasingly difficult as state budgets tightened in the second half of the year last year. There is some good news in testing. Despite state and district budget pressures, Acuity, that is our formative testing program is adding new districts and retaining current customers. Renewals continue to be strong. We are benefiting from interest at the district level for technically sound classroom assessment.", "And let us not forget the testing is still a required part of state education programs and a focus of districts seeking to move schools ahead and accurately measure achievement and growth. We anticipate that grants to states for Summative, that is the highest exam of testing under the No Child Left Behind Act will probably be funded at or near the 2008 level about $410 million in the new education budget.", "At the end of December 41 states \u2013 at the end of December 41 states in the District of Columbia reported budget deficits for their current fiscal years, which end in most cases June 30. Of the top 16 states in terms of instructional materials purchasing, 5 had already enacted mid-year cuts in their educational budgets totaling about $370 million and cuts from additional states are expected.", "On a macro level, it is not possible to quantify possible reductions in the purchasing of instruction materials based on reductions in overall education budgets because there are so many variations in funding practices across the state, but it seems prudent to assume that some budget cuts will affect purchasing by schools in the first half of 2009.", "There also is some concern about budgets for the fiscal year but we\u2019re not likely to have much clarity on the 2009, 2010 state education funding until May or just a little bit after that. When the spring tax revenue comes in and legislatures begin to complete budgets for the new fiscal year.", "A new Federal education budget from the Obama administration has been promised for February. It may contain an increase in Title 1 Grants to districts with high numbers of disadvantaged students. These funds can be used for the purchase of instructional materials along for \u2013 along with other purposes. More immediately, any funding for school infrastructure improvement included in the general economic stimulus package would benefit education and the industry indirectly by freeing up more state and local education allocations for instructional related expenses.", "This week as we all are watching the U.S. House Of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a stimulus bill which will send $41 billion to local school districts. It also includes $79 billion in state fiscal relief. The effort to prevent cutbacks in key state services provides $39 billion to local school districts and public colleges and universities. All told there is $140 billion in this stimulus package for education. A stimulus bill from the senate is in the works. It will include tax credits for tuition fees and for the first time the purchase of course materials.", "Congress is on track to pass the economic stimulus package before adjourning on February 13th for President\u2019s Day. Clearly there are many developments that could influence prospects this year in the school market. We\u2019re following these developments closely and obviously we\u2019ll keep you posted of how we are seeing it. None of the current proposed stimulus is in our financials.", "Let us some up for McGraw-Hill Education. Federal funds may help alleviate pressure on state and local funding for education, a 10% to 15% decline in the elementary-high school market in 2009 and growth of 3% to 4% in the U.S. higher education market and for this segment a low-single digit revenue decline and the 300 basis points to 400 basis points decline in the operating margin excluding the 2008 restructuring charges.", "And finally now let us review the Information & Media segment. Growth in business to business markets and a record year in political advertising in broadcasting were key factors in this segment\u2019s performance in face of weakness for print advertising. Revenue for the business to business group increased by 4.1% for 2008 and by 0.2% in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the broadcasting group increased by 4% for 2008 and by 11.3% in the fourth quarter. This segment\u2019s revenue increased by 4.1% for 2008 and 1.3% in the fourth quarter including pre-tax restructuring charges of $19.2 million for a workforce reduction of approximately 210 positions and a $22.6 million decrease in incentive compensation. Operating profit increased by 45% in 2008.", "In the fourth quarter of 2008 including a pre-tax restructuring charge of $5.3 million for a work force reduction of approximately 70 positions and a $6.4 million decrease in incentive compensation expense the operating profit increased 61.7%. The operating margin was 8.7% for the year and 11.4% for the fourth quarter. Restructuring charges reduced the operating margin by 181 basis points for the year and 186 basis points for the fourth quarter.", "Volatility in energy markets increased the demand for information and we clearly benefited in 2008. Platts' news, pricing and conference businesses produced solid results all year. We look forward to solid results again in 2009. J.D. Power and Associates benefited from strong results in the Asia Pacific market primarily automotive in China for the year but experienced some softness in the fourth quarter.", "McGraw-Hill Construction again in our project news network was offset by softness at suites and a fall off in the media advertising and advertising pages at BusinessWeek were down 16.1% for the year and 19.6% in the fourth quarter.", "Political advertising was another story. Our broadcasting group had a record year in political advertising with more than half of it coming in the fourth quarter. Total revenue from political advertising topped $27 million in 2008. A recessionary environment and a year without significant elections will challenge the advertising market here obviously in 2009.", "Problems in the automotive market will be an issue for advertising and J.D. Power and Associates in 2009. Another factor in our revenue picture is a shift to online services at J.D. Power which impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Bob will have a few more details on that in his presentation.", "So summing up for the Information & Media segment, a low-single digits decline in revenue, 200 basis points to 300 basis points reduction in the margin and that is excluding 2008 restructuring charges.", "And therefore summing up for The McGraw-Hill Companies, 2009 will be another challenging year, tight credit markets, budget pressures on state and local governments will affect some spending on education and some softness in advertising. Obviously there is a great deal of uncertainty in this environment but we\u2019re encouraged by yesterday\u2019s USAToday\u2019s new economic survey of 52 top economists and prospects for the second half of this year. Growth in U.S. GDP products resumes in the third quarter of 2009 and expands in the fourth quarter and according to these median estimates encouraging but we will have to see how this stimulus package impacts our markets. That is hard to predict. So we have not factored it again into any aspects of our forecast. At this point in the year, we expect consolidated 2009 revenue to decline 1% to 2% compared to 2008 and earnings per share in a range from $2.20 to $2.30 and we\u2019ll have to see it from there.", "Okay, with that let me now turn it over to Bob and Bob is going to provide a little bit more granularity about our performance and some of the key assumptions underpinning our guidance that are baked into our overall plans in terms of budget considerations for 2009. So Bob?", "Donald Rubin", "Okay, thank you Terry. Today I'm going to focus most of my remarks this morning on providing guidance for 2009. But before I get to this discussion I will mention some key points as to how we finished 2008. The environment clearly continues to be challenging but as Terry pointed out we did achieve $2.65 per share excluding restructuring charges, which is at the high end of our guidance.", "Our cash flow under our definition which is after all investments and a dividend came in at $455 million. Share repurchases which mainly occurred in the earlier part of the year totaled 10.9 million shares resulting in a cash outflow of $447 million.", "Now to the fourth quarter operating performance highlights and we\u2019ll start with Financial Services. Credit Market Services revenue declined 24.5% and as debt issuance was minimal during the difficult months of October and November. As you know December started to show some signs of life particularly in the U.S. investment grade issuance.", "Investment Services revenue grew 7% but clearly at a slower rate than in the first three quarters which were double digits from the weakness that was felt in the banking and investment services sectors. Expenses continue to be prudently managed. However,", "fourth quarter margins at 35.5% versus 38.3% in the prior year excluding restructuring charges were clearly influenced by softer revenue as Credit Markets Services revenue was the lowest of all four quarters for 2008.", "For \u2013 now for McGraw-Hill Education, higher education, professional and international group\u2019s revenues declined 2% influenced by currency of course. Solid performance in the U.S. College and university market was offset by a challenging retail environment for professional as well as weaker overseas sales due to the strengthening dollar and weakening economic conditions in our Spanish language markets.", "Softness in the supplemental market and residual sales contributed to an 18.6% revenue decline at School Education Group. A 4.8% decline in expenses, excluding restructuring charges in both years, could not offset the impact of the revenue decline for the quarter.", "Now for Information & Media, revenue grew 1.3% driven by broadcasting strong political sales in the Denver market, continued growth from Platt\u2019s news and pricing services. Offsetting this growth was softness in broadcasting\u2019s local and national advertising revenue as well as declines in advertising revenue from BusinessWeek. The expenses here were managed effectively and coupled with the revenue growth resulted in margins expanding to 13.3% excluding restructuring charges.", "There were significant restructuring actions during 2008. So I would like to take a moment to provide an update on employee headcount. Total number of employees ending 2008 was 21,649. This reflects an increase of 478 employees compared to year-end 2007. This is net of the restructuring actions taken during the past year and keep in mind that the most recent fourth quarter action relates to terminations that will mainly occur in 2009.", "The net increase in headcount is due to higher financial services primarily \u2013 particularly internationally to support our fast growing data and information business as well as CRISIL's rapidly growing ratings equity research services outsourcing support businesses located in India. In fact employment has grown only in our overseas markets as it declined in the U.S.", "Now let us move to 2009 and of course there is a great deal of uncertainty that we\u2019re facing and this guidance will give you broad parameters on how we have built that plan. So for the company as Terry pointed we expect revenue to decline 1% to 2%. So I\u2019ll begin with Financial Services. Our guidance of 1.5% to 2% revenue growth for Financial Services in 2009 is a blend of high-single digit growth in Investment Services with a slight decline at Credit Markets Services. And as you know, Credit Markets Services is approximately 66% of total Financial Services\u2019 revenue.", "Our guidance is based on current foreign exchange rate projections, which clearly influences growth as the strengthening dollar will negatively impact this growth in 2009.", "On a constant currency basis revenue is projected to grow approximately 5% to 6% for this segment. Investment Services revenue is primarily billed in U.S. dollars. So foreign exchange largely impacts Credit Markets Services revenue. Credit Markets Services revenue will benefit from growth of 1% to 2% in non-transaction revenue which is recurring in nature such as relationship fees, surveillance fees, and subscriptions that Terry discussed.", "Modest price increases will help as well. The reason we\u2019re able to forecast growth in 2009 is because certain nonrecurring items that showed significant declines in 2008 such as bank loan ratings should not hamper us in 2009. We expected 10% to 12% decline in transaction revenue. This is based on better comparables and some recovery in the latter part of the year following a 55% decline in 2008. While transaction revenue was particularly depressed in the fourth quarter the month of December as a previously indicated showed improvement. While our projections do not anticipate any meaningful uptick in new issuance volume particularly in non-investment grade issuance we do expect that December will be a better proxy for 2009 with some potential market pickup in the second half. This should help transaction revenue.", "While Investment Services fourth quarter revenue grew 7% year-over-year as I mentioned earlier it did decline sequentially compared to the third quarter. Their customer base is facing challenges and growth in index services in the quarter was hampered by a significant market declines. However ETF assets inflows continued to grow strongly which leaves us well positioned when the market rebounds. As a result we expect high single digit revenue growth in 2009 for Investment Services based on continued growth for indices, sales of new products and services, particularly Capital IQ and benefits from modest price increases.", "As Terry indicated, we are projecting 250 basis points to 300 basis points margin decline at Financial Services in 2009. This guidance implies that expenses will increase approximately 6% for an operating margin in the range of 37.7% to 38.2%. On a constant currency basis we expect expenses to increase approximately 10% reflecting the full year impact of 2008 hires particularly our investment services. Most improvements were added oversees that I pointed out earlier and continued investments in our fast growing businesses although at a reduced pace as well as increased stock based compensation.", "Partly offsetting these are the benefits of our restructuring actions. I will provide more detail on the impact of incentive compensation later. Finish off [ph] with one final comment on margins. While we\u2019re projecting margin contraction at Financial Services for the full year we do expect margins to improve from the 35.5% margin IN the fourth quarter of 2008 which excludes restructuring charges. The fourth quarter\u2019s margins were depressed since it was the lowest revenue producing quarter of the year. This is primarily driven by the fact that the fourth quarter revenues particularly transaction revenues were depressed in light of the low debt issues particularly in October and November. As a result they had a more pronounced impact given the high fixed cost of the business.", "I will now turn to McGraw-Hill Education. Terry covered most of their revenue issues but there are a couple of items I like to address. For higher education, professional and international the U.S. college market is expected to grow 3% to 4% and we expect to grow in line with the market. However growth in the overall HPI group will be negatively impacted by a very challenging professional market and the impact of the stronger dollar on overseas sales. And to underscore Terry\u2019s point about the weakening state new adoption market in 2009 I will point out that California makes up approximately one-third of the total new adoption market and this naturally bears watching [ph].", ".", "We expected a 300 basis points to 400 basis point decline in this segment\u2019s margin for 2009. This implies a 9% to 10% margin. Expenses are expected to be roughly flat despite plant amortization increasing $15 million and increased investments at higher education and with it greater emphasis on digital products. This segment will benefit from restructuring actions taken in 2008, the completion of the data center moves, and lower marketing costs due to reduced opportunities in the adoption markets.", "For Information & Media, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits. We expect continued growth for energy information from Platt\u2019s, however, this growth will not be enough to offset the loss of political advertising in a nonpolitical year, an extremely challenging advertising environment, and turmoil in the automotive market. Additionally, our results for the year will be adversely impacted by a non cash accounting change at J.D. Power relating to the introduction of COMPASS [ph] a more robust reporting and analytical tool for our clients.", "Revenue previously recognized at the point of syndicated studies release will now be recognized ratably over a 12-month life of the subscription. Now this is similar to the suite\u2019s transition that we had talked about back in 2006.", "Now for 2009, this will result in a $15 million revenue decline and a $10 million decline in profits. This migration will also impact 2010 and 2011 but to a lesser degree. Our guidance for Information & Media margin is a 200 basis point to 300 basis point decline. This essentially implies a 7.5% to 8.5% margin with expense growth flat, largely due to restructuring actions taken in 2008.", "Now for the impact of incentive compensation. As Terry discussed in his remarks incentive compensation was reduced by approximately $274 million in 2008. There will be some incentives being reinstated in 2009 but in the amount of approximately $110 million across all segments in corporate.", "Corporate expenses in 2009 will increase $25 million to $30 million and this largely reflects increased stock-based and short-term incentive compensation. The data center construction was largely completed and virtually all of the applications, systems and equipment migrations were finished in 2008. A little bit carried over into January. Now the migration cost totaled $31 million and was $10 million in the fourth quarter.", "McGraw-Hill Education represented about half of the migration effort in order to support their full range of digital offerings for the elementary, high school, college, and professional and college markets. The migration effort in fact was completed during this past weekend. And these costs are minimal in 2009.", "Regarding the company\u2019s effective tax rate, we expect a lower effective tax rate for 2009. It will be approximately 37% which is lower than the 37.5% rate to 2008. Two changes in our business are influencing this decline. The continued higher growth in our international operations has a favorable impact on the rate. Also we recently formed Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. In addition to operational benefits we expect this new structure to be more tax efficient.", "Let us now review free cash flow. We continued to generate sizable free cash flow in 2008 despite a challenging environment. As you can see from the table cash provided by operations per US GAAP was $1.2 billion for 2008. We then subtract the following items; prepublication investments, purchases of property and equipment, additions to technology projects, and dividends paid to shareholders. The result is free cash flow that is available to the company for share repurchases, acquisitions, and to pay down debt.", "Free cash flow for 2008 was $455 million. The strengthening dollar reduced the value of our overseas cash balances by approximately $50 million and this change is reflected in our free cash flow. Based on our operating guidance for 2009, we anticipate free cash flow in the range of $430 million to $450 million. Despite our projections for lower operating results this level of free cash flow is comparable to 2008 and is the result of easier working capital comparison as well as reduced investments that I will discuss in just a moment.", "An item that we have not factored into the free cash flow guidance is the potential for any pension plan contributions. The U.S. plan is now in an underfunded position following last year\u2019s significant market declines. We continued to follow the guidance we are receiving from the government agencies regarding contribution formula changes. Based on what we are now seeing we may have no funding requirement in 2009 or if one is required it could be in the range of $30 million to $50 million. And if it is required it will would not be payable until the second half of the year.", "Now let me recap the corporation\u2019s strong financial position. On a gross basis, total debt at year end was $1.27 billion. It is comprised of $1.2 billion in unsecured senior notes that we issued in 2007 as well as $70 million in commercial paper. This is offset by $472 million in cash. We did repatriate cash from overseas in the fourth quarter. However, our cash balance still consists largely of foreign cash plus some cash held in the U.S. for operational purposes.", "Our net debt at the end of December was $796 million in down from $801 million last year or virtually flat.

The sequential decline was minimal since we did not repurchase shares in the fourth quarter.", "Year-end WASO or weighted average shares outstanding was 318.7 million shares, a 26.1 million share year-over-year decline. The figure for fully diluted shares at the end of the year was 315 million.", "Interest expense was $15.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $12 million in the same period last year. For the full year interest expense was $75.6 million compared to $40.6 million in 2007 and we expect 2009 to be roughly comparable to 2008.", "We are also focusing on our investments and our capital expenditures will decline in 2009. Prepublication investments for 2009 are expected to be $225 million versus $254 million in 2008. This lower spend level is due to reduced investment revenue opportunities in 2009 as well as prudent investments and continued offshoring benefits.", "Purchases of property and equipment for 2009 are projected at approximately $90 million versus $106 million in 2008. This $16 million decline is largely due to reduced technology spending.", "Let us now look at some non-cash items. For 2009, we expect amortization of prepublication costs to be $285 million versus $270 million in 2008. This increase reflects the higher level of investments made in 2007 and 2008. We expect depreciation to grow to $130 million in 2009 versus $120 million in 2008. Amortization of intangibles was $17.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the acceleration of the amortization of certain acquired intangibles.

Thank you Bob and Don you want to start us off.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Donald Rubin", "Yes, thank you Terry. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. (Operator instructions) We are now ready for questions.", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Thank you, good morning. First question I think is for Bob. Bob on the incentive comp decline of $274 million; can you help me understand how much of that is reversible per year of accruals versus a year-to-year reduction in \u201808 from \u201907?", "Robert Bahash", "Okay, yes Peter not to enter specifics about the specific amounts but the incentive compensation decline consists of really two components, one is lower, short-term annual incentive compensation just driven by the overall performance but also as you point out, there is a reversal of accruals relating to our three-year grant program which really deals with 2007 and 2006 grants and certain accruals that were restarted in the beginning of the year for 2008 grants that were reversed. So there is a much larger change that occurred in 2008 than you would normally see. So it is a combination of lower, short-term incentive compensation relating to the specific year as well as reversals of accruals that were put on the books for the three-year long-term plans in the previous couple of years.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Right. So would incentive comp in total then be a zero or negative number in \u201908?", "Robert Bahash", "Say that, I am not sure I understood that.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "I am wondering if the reversal of prior year accruals exceeded the short-term incentive comp accruals in \u201909.", "Robert Bahash", "No. Okay, the answer to that is no. There is a combination here. First of all, let\u2019s say, there are certain businesses that did achieve their targets or achieved within the bands [ph] and short-term incentive compensation was paid to some of those businesses. In addition there is the component of the long-term incentive award that is stock-based compensation and as you know, you are recording an accrual for the stock-based compensation regardless of what happens at the end. So the answer to that is it would not be zero. I think the key point here is that as I mentioned in my remarks, there are certain accruals that we were making or planning for 2009 totaling $110 million but that is at targets that are a bit lower than we normally would be \u2013 than a normal year. So we are anticipating lower payouts for certain types of awards.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. One more thing then I will get off this topic, what was the actual then incentive comp expense side in \u201908?", "Robert Bahash", "For the whole company?", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Yes.", "Robert Bahash", "I don\u2019t have that number handy Peter but I think the easiest way to describe is for the corporate side it was zero with the exception of the accrual for stock options. For Education it was minimal, for Information & Media certain businesses achieved their targets and for Financial Services there is a combination of normal short-term incentives that kick in a target and there is also the portion of profit sharing contribution incentive compensation amount which is similar to Financial Services. So there is a payout based on lower percentages. That gives you an idea there were certainly payouts in certain businesses but at much lower rates than we had experienced.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, and then one other thing for Bob or Terry, on the S&P margins I guess I am somewhat surprised to see you budgeting for a 10% increase in costs next year and the contacts and all the staff reductions you have done can you help me I guess better understand what is driving those cost pressures?", "Harold McGraw III", "Well there are a number of factors there, on the S&P Investment Services side, they are growing very nicely and we are continuing to invest there. We also, in terms of a non-transaction revenue, are maintaining very strong surveillance staff on that part and we certainly do anticipate at some point here some pick up and so our expenses at this point are reflecting the growth on the Investment Services side as well as some of the surveillance capabilities on non-transaction revenue.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "And Terry have you really thought your expectations in terms of where you think the longer term margins that S&P can be sustained?", "Harold McGraw III", "Well, again, you know we are in the toughest period right now. I think that when we look back at some point, the fourth quarter of \u201908 and the first quarter of \u201909 is going to be the bottom point and so again you are dealing with a fair bit of uncertainty and talking about when new issuance volume starts to pick up and in what areas and the like. Clearly we would like to get back to a much higher level on this one. Do you have increased legal cost? Do you have increased compliance cost? The question is yes, but I differ at this point, clearly we guide to get well back into the 40s on that one and we will watch it together as we go.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great. Thanks Terry.", "Harold McGraw III", "Thanks Peter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Barclays Capital", "My question is mainly about regulation here in the States, you mentioned Terry in your speech back at the media conference earlier this year, you talked the regulatory issues in the US would drag into 2010, could you elaborate on that further. And most importantly, what are you expecting with the new administration here, a more democratic congress and obviously seems like a very tough person now running the SEC, what sort of changes do you expect in the regulatory front in the S&P ratings business this year, thanks.", "Harold McGraw III", "Thanks Craig. Craig, you know, I am feeling more sanguine about all of that. As I told you that on the regulatory basis, I have risks to the business as relatively low, it is in our best interest to have very strong regulation that brings more clarity and simplifies the process and that is something that we took on as an initiative earlier on in terms of the voluntary oversight frameworks in Europe with both the Commission, IOSCO and CESR the Regulators and we were less successful in bringing that a part of the SEC. When Chairman Frank insisted upon going that direction, most of what we had gotten in those frameworks we got into the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of \u201906 and so we were pleased with that part of it. We are going to see some here in the States, I think there is going to be a lot taking place in the first half of this year. We think that you are going to see some enhanced NRSRO rules on that one. We have already opined on them and pushed back. We think that they strengthen the current condition, they are not overbearing and onerous and we think that in Europe we are going to see a conclusion, and again we are guessing now, probably in the April/May timeframe that it is going to very consistent in the end with US regulatory policy. So I think it is going to bring a lot more simplicity, a lot more transparency and we are very supportive. So I don\u2019t see an environment, with the Obama administration, that is going to be more intrusive on that one. Chairman Shapiro I think has been very forthright. She has a terrific track record and we look forward to working with her and the staff making sure that the SEC is doing really well on the regulatory front is I think is a part of what we have to be about and we are going to do everything we can to make the regulation successful and that is where we have got to be.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Barclays Capital", "On a totally separate matter, are you seeing anything on your transaction-based business here early first quarter that gives you any sort of hope that things are starting to turn here particularly if you maybe look at the investment grade market from the issuance?", "Harold McGraw III", "I have always been more optimistic in whatever so I better be careful here; but you know, I really look at 2009 as the first half, second half year. I think we are going to see \u2013 we have to see what the stimulus package does, what the effect of some of that is on the state and local government, but I think that with some of the infrastructure projects and the like, I think we are going to see some additional public financing. I think corporates and governments are going to show some pickup. The real question is going to be are we going to see any pickup in the structured area and I certainly think that in some of the assets backed area, collateralized loan obligation, some of those kind of markets, the question mark is in the mortgage-backed securities and it is very hard to see new growth there yet. But I think we might surprise ourselves especially in the second half of this year.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Now I will turn back to my first question, can you just explain to us why you don\u2019t think that the SEC may look real hard at changing how you get paid on your issuance in terms of maybe going back how it was 30 or 35 years ago when investors used to pay for the ratings?", "Harold McGraw III", "Yes, we are going to get into that as we have in a very big way. I mean, there are multiple business models that you could look. You could look at an issuer pay, you could look at an investor pay, you could look at a subscription base, you could look at a whole host of things. On every single business model that you come up with is going to have conflicts or potential conflicts inherent in it and you are going to always have to have a very clear process and a very compliant process to be able to deal with those kinds of conflicts. The question really ends up, as we were saying before, what is it you are trying to solve the equation for? If you are trying to solve the equation for a higher transparency which is what is foremost on everybody\u2019s mind, then the issuer-pay model gets you closest to that because of the fact that the issuer pays. We disseminate all that data free of charge worldwide and so that is where we have come down. We have looked at the pros and cons of other kinds of models and we look forward to working with the SEC in addressing that but when you take a look at the pros and cons of each of the business models, if you are starving for higher transparency, it is more the issuer pay. Now making sure that you are managing those conflicts and that there is very clear process on that is also very, very important and that is one of the things that \u2013 things like some of the 27 leadership actions like the ombudsman and other kinds of things that we think is very important as part of the process so that it is very clear, but that is the approach we are taking.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Great, thank you.", "Harold McGraw III", "Thanks Craig.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Meltz with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you. One comment there, I don\u2019t know if you want to answer this or not but on that question it is not quite clear to me through all my research if the SEC even has the authority to try to change your revenue model. That is just a comment on my part, if you want to answer it, fine, if not, that is okay. Secondly, on S&P trends, I don\u2019t know if Vicky is there or Deven, but can you talk a little bit exactly what you have seen in the past three weeks, my understanding is there has been a pickup in high-yield deals, we have seen some of these drive-by type of transactions, there has been a couple of CLOs that in fact your comment about a slow start to \u201909, there has been a lot more activity of late than what we did see in Q4 and then I have a follow-up.", "Harold McGraw III", "Thanks Michael. On the SEC side, we are regulated by the SEC and it is in our best interest. We do everything we can to make the process a success and that is what we are going to do in all of that and so we will have those discussions. As far as pickup to the beginning of the year, you know Michael; it is just \u2013 there is just so much uncertainty in here. Clearly we have seen an improvement, if you call it that, from the fourth quarter of last year. I still think that when we look back in terms of economic growth and things like that, the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year are going to be the bottom part; it is going to be the worst. Now what we have got to see is in terms of business activity, in terms of how states are going to finance some of their issues and like. We have got to see where the new activity is. So, yes we see some spots here and there and I think that hopefully that part will start to build but we have got to get a little bit more evidence before we start saying that we think that in any particular category new issuance is starting to really pick up. I think we are really talking about ups and downs a little bit in the first half, I am hopeful that by the time we get into the second half, we are going to see some change but we have to see some evidence of that.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Bob, another question for you on the incentive compensation, I just don\u2019t think I understand what your guidance implies, if the mid-point of EPS guidance is down 15% year-over-year and I guess you are implying EBIT declines, what are you modeling for incentive comps to increase year-over-year? I don\u2019t think I understand what you are saying.", "Robert Bahash", "Yes, the comment that I made is that incentive compensation, there is a decline, let\u2019s work off the decline in 2008 which was $274 million. The budget calls for \u2013 what we are carrying in the budget is an increase of $110 million which is spread across the corporation. For the most part the incentive payments and I did mention on Peter\u2019s comments that there are incentive payments that occur in the Standard & Poor\u2019s business based on what is more like a profit sharing model. There is a very modest growth in that incentive pool planned for 2009. There are other areas that basically paid out nothing so there is some reinstatement and there is also an accrual based on the long-term incentive compensation which saw a couple of years of reversals. So net/net there is an increase in incentive compensation across the corporation for short-term incentive compensation as well as stock-based and long-term compensation of $110 million.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. And Peter\u2019s question, I think for us it is kind of hard to assess what that means if we don\u2019t know the base level for \u201908 it would be helpful to get the number of what incentive comp was in \u201908 so we can truly analyze the increase. I have one follow-up question, in terms of your revenue guidance for education, if I listened what you are saying about HPI, you are saying the college market is up 3% to 4%, total HPI will be up less because of some of the other businesses there but you are pointing to total revenue for the group down just I think low-single digits and I think that if I back into it you are saying K-12 will do better or school will do better than the 10 of the 10% to 15% for the market, am I missing something here, can you talk a little bit more about that please?", "Robert Bahash", "Well 10% to 15% Michael is a pretty good spread. Again, the uncertainty levels given some of the state and local pressures are there. That was our best guess coming out of the fourth quarter on this one. We will have to see what some of the stimulus initiatives are going to do at the state and local level and what the willingness is going to be to spend. Certainly I think education is going to be a priority for most states and obviously $140 billion of stimulus is got to be spent somewhere and so we will see as we get into the year on those things but at this point I think that to be very conservative I think we should stay with our 10% to 15% down for K-12 and we will see.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Catriona Fallon with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "Good morning, thanks for taking the question.", "Harold McGraw III", "Hi Catriona.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi. On the Education business, this past year I think some of the margin decline was due to investing in digital products and it seems that next year some of the decline is really due to the fact that elementary-high is going to be weak and Education revenue was down, can you tell us a little bit more about the margins on the digital products and how we should be thinking about the Education margin longer term?", "Robert Bahash", "Okay, you know nobody mostly me is happy with the margin levels here. The push and the aggressiveness on the digital product and offerings I think is a unique opportunity that is starting to materialize in a much broader way especially at the higher education and increasingly at K-12. And we are going to push aggressively on that and those are higher margin businesses and we are going to work as part of some of these new initiatives too aggressive on that. So we will just have to keep that in front of us but obviously we have never retreated, it has only been timing and then the turmoil of \u201908 and where we are in \u201909 but we want to get to that 20% and there is no let up on that part of it and digital has to be a very strong component of that and that part will continue.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "Can you give us some color as to the percent of revenue in education that is due to digital products?", "Robert Bahash", "The percentage of digital is right now very modest. In the higher education professional side, there is a mixture. There is very little coming from our international side. Our professional publishing and Terry mentioned a number of product offerings there albeit the smallest of the three businesses we are seeing a greater penetration of digital coming out of professional with renewal rates on that revenue up in the 90% range. So we are seeing here the signs of what we expect to see hopefully at the higher education side. The higher education penetration is very, very small at this point in time.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay great. Now, I will just switch gears quickly to Financial Services, can you give us a little bit of color on some of the areas within Credit Market Services where you saw improvement in debt issuance in December and then specifically what did you see from mortgage-backed securities in December?", "Robert Bahash", "The latter one is the easiest that was very low. There is some very small activity but that is virtually flat. Where we saw some activities obviously is on the corporate governments as well as some public finance on that one. As Michael had suggested as well, we saw some pickup in some issuance in terms of asset-based securities, some collateralized loan obligations but the structured area has been very impacted on this. We need to see some additional life to that but at this point corporates public financing governments is carrying that.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay and then just a quick last question, once we do get through this downturn in the market what do you think the credit market services can grow at on a longer term basis?", "Robert Bahash", "Well, as you know from historical rates, again if the economy is growing and the sectors are participating, you are going to see obviously a return to very good growth and I think we are in the closer to the ending process of unwinding some of that. We need to see the credit markets be more accommodating as that starts to take place I think that we are going to see certainly a return on the high-yield side, more activities on the corporates and I think you are going to see a resumption maybe not on the residential mortgage-backed side but maybe on the commercial mortgage-backed side and some of that activity and you are going to start to see that come again and I am hoping by the second-half of this year.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, sorry I do have one more question, just in the month of December we were seeing a little bit of issuance in Europe on the structured side, maybe not as much on the NBA [ph] side but banks were pledging and building up collaterals for loans basically from the government and I am just wondering if you saw ratings revenue for any of that activity?", "Robert Bahash", "Again, in terms of an economic environment, I think the United States is probably somewhere around, I don\u2019t know, six months ahead of Europe. I think Europe has a little bit more to go in all of this and therefore we will be watching that kind of activity but certainly in terms of bank loan ratings, in terms of some of the core financing there the extent to which there is growth activity, I think that we will see that pick up but probably more slowly than we will see here.", "Catriona Fallon \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Marc Sugarman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Marc Sugarman \u2013 Citigroup", "Good morning.", "Harold McGraw III", "Good morning Marc.", "Marc Sugarman \u2013 Citigroup", "Two quick questions on education. The first on college you talked about, I think you talked about 3% to 4% growth for college especially the international and you said that it was after a currency drag, I just wondered how much of a currency impact is in that number and could you also split out college within that as well. And then secondly, on schools, I think at the Arizona Conference you hosted a couple of weeks back, you were talking about the adoption market being 725 to 775, so you brought that down a little bit which I guess is the Florida Music Adoption that you mentioned but you have not changed the overall range of schools being down 10% to 15%, I was wondering if you could just square that circle.", "Harold McGraw III", "Tell you, I will give you the latter one and Bob you can go on the currency with education. When we were out there again we were, I mean 10% to 15% down is a pretty safe conservative view because we just don\u2019t know. We do know that because of some of the cutbacks and some of the state views of this especially in the open territory there is a lot of concern and there is going to be some pullbacks. Florida and California represent almost half of the opportunities in this year\u2019s state new adoption market and K-5 math and reading are going to very, very important. The good thing is we are very strong in both of those capabilities. So we have to see what they are going to do in all of this. So I think it is safe to say that we brought the state new adoption number down a little bit because we have seen some cutbacks. The bottom line is we are very uncertain as to what the stimulus is going to do at the state level. The $140 billion going through the states on education is a sizeable, sizeable number and I don\u2019t know if that is going to have people re-think and influence. So I think at this point we need to be pretty conservative. We are looking at a big number for 2010 and 2011 now because you are not only picking up some of the \u201908 and \u201909 cutbacks or whatever but you are also into big, big major recycles in the business in all that and we are more investing obviously in that product sometimes these big programs are two-and-a-half years developed. So we are in an active mode on those and getting ready for that but we will have to see what exactly takes place in \u201909 but I think staying with the 10% to 15% at this point and the state new adoption level is where we are is a good number.", "Marc Sugarman \u2013 Citigroup", "Is your participation pretty much the same in \u201909 as in \u201908?", "Harold McGraw III", "Yes. Again, our expectation always is that capture rates of 30% is where we need to be and if it is in a very strong weaning cycle or math cycle we fully expect to do better than that.", "Robert Bahash", "Let me respond to your question on the higher education side. There are two parts to this. The 3% to 4% reference related to the US higher education market there is much better data to measure here. So Terry\u2019s comments focused specifically on the US higher education piece of HPI where we expect to grow in line with the market. On an overall basis for HPI where we are forecasting to be off around 1% currency clearly has an impact here. If you exclude the currency impact, the growth rate is in the 3% range for all of HPI.", "Marc Sugarman \u2013 Citigroup", "Just one question, given that December saw quite a big pickup in college and you know the point that Terry made on counter-cyclicality you go into the market in 2008 with 3% I was surprised that you would not expect it to be a little bit stronger in 2009?", "Robert Bahash", "Again, I am with your sentiment, I am hoping on this one but I think given the uncertainty and the conditions and state tuitions and all that 3% to 4% is probably a good number at this point.", "Marc Sugarman \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks very much.", "Robert Bahash", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Wallace [ph] with ING [ph]. Please go ahead.", "Simon Wallace \u2013 ING", "Good morning, thanks for taking my questions.", "Robert Bahash", "Good morning Simon.", "Simon Wallace \u2013 ING", "Good morning. A couple on market share. The first following up with the last question on higher education, you are growing in a way 1% versus roughly 3% for the market, can you comment on competitive pressures from Pearson, maybe some of the other competitors like Cengage and also on the schools market, I think you are modeling about 30% capture rate for \u201909, do you have an idea what your capture rate was for \u201908 please?", "Harold McGraw III", "Okay, Bob will give you the latter one. In terms of competitive pressures, it really depends on your current offering level. This was a lower year for us in terms of revision of major titles and that influenced some of the mix. From a competitive standpoint I think no change. The only thing that in terms of Cengage there was a very, very aggressive price increase that they put through and I think they captured a little more from that \u2013 in all that but I see no significant change in that. We are going to have a bigger cycle this year as we put out the earnings release in terms of major title revisions as well as some new entries and so I think at this point the market is 3% to 4% and we look to match that and hopefully improve on that.", "Simon Wallace \u2013 ING", "Are you happy with your kind of digital products Harold, is that kind of fully competitive with some of the competitors?", "Harold McGraw III", "Again, it is in different areas and Bob was talking about where we are on the professional side but the higher education side is very aggressive and you are going to see continued focus on that. College students today on average are taking one course online. We see that accelerating. We think that with the counter-cyclicality in terms of some of the unemployment that you are going to see more online activity necessary and we are just going to continue on that path.", "Robert Bahash", "Just on the comment that you raised with regard to the 2008 growth rates for higher education, again I need to break that apart a bit, the higher education professional international group grew by just under 1%, was influenced by currency when you take currency out the overall group which includes the US Higher Education business, Professional and the International Publishing would have grown 1.5%. Now we look at the US Higher Education, I think that was the thrust of your question the US Higher Education market. As I indicated yes, we did not \u2013 we did not grow in line with the market but the growth rate there was a little under 2.5% so figures were a little bit better than you were thinking here.", "Simon Wallace \u2013 ING", "(inaudible).", "Robert Bahash", "I am sorry, repeat that one for me, would you?", "Simon Wallace \u2013 ING", "Just to understand what you think your market share was in \u201908, am I right thinking you are basing your \u201909 guidance on that 30% capture rate.", "Robert Bahash", "Yes, the capture rate for the new adoptions was 30% and based on the data that we have been receiving from the AAP on an overall basis which takes into account often territories, residual sales and such, we have slightly \u2013 we have performed slightly better than the market. That is the basis for our guidance into 2009 as well. We feel we have excellent product offerings for the new adoption marketplace and we are looking at capturing share on the other side as well.", "Simon Wallace \u2013 ING", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Atorino with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.", "Edward Atorino \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Hi Terry, on education, was any of the \u201908 strengths sort of let\u2019s spend the rest of the budget because we are not going to have anything in \u201909 on sort of a borrowing from \u201909 number one. Number two, would you see any change in the ordering \u2013 timing of orders in \u201909 due to budgetary pressures might they come earlier whilst schools have the money or later when they find out how much money they have?", "Robert Bahash", "Good morning Ed.", "Edward Atorino \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Good morning.", "Robert Bahash", "Yes, I think that you are probably going to see a little bit more of delay. I think that given the state economic conditions you know that they are going to be looking for the stimulus and how quickly the stimulus is going to be getting out. And so I think that is going to be a little bit of a whole impact. I don\u2019t think anybody is trying to borrow from one year to the next to the like. They are really trying to fully fund their requirements and they are postponing or they are splitting up into a one-year or two-year buy in certain programs. But the emphasis on this year is a lower state adoption market than we had anticipated in a large part because of the state conditions but California and Florida are the ones to watch and the core capabilities for this year are going to be K-5 math, K-5 reading and 6-12 literature and those are all areas of strength for us and so we are hoping that that is where we are going to be able to benefit.", "Edward Atorino \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Could you sort of flush out your comments on 2010 to 2011. You said recycle, are these going to be sort of the big year levels and any major programs that are sort of on the horizon?", "Robert Bahash", "You know we have \u2013 because of the conditions in the latter part of \u201907 and certainly \u201908, we have seen cycles elongated here. You are running into some very core discipline programs coming up. You are talking about reading math, social studies, you are talking about literature, all of the core disciplines coming up, you are talking about state new adoption markets somewhere in the billion dollar range for 2010 and probably for 2011 and with a much improved economic condition hopefully and with less funding pressures I think we are going to get back to what you would consider some of the bigger years. We will see in all of this and there are some unknowns right now in terms of obviously stimulus but we will see but right now 2010 and 2011 are looking to be the years that we had hoped that 2008 and 2009 were going to be.", "Edward Atorino \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Robert Bahash", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Barry Lucas with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Barry Lucas \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Terry, I want to come to the comments that Bob made on of projecting free cash flow of around flattish $450 million for 2009 and how do you prioritize the use of that with the stock sitting kind of at a ten-year low and the balance sheet in awfully good shape, debt under $1 billion and so share repurchases, the dividend payments you alluded to earlier and M&A activities are opportunities that may come your way because of your strong financial position.", "Harold McGraw III", "Barry, good morning and thanks. But you know, again, uses of that free cash flow taking into account exactly what you were saying across the board. I think that there are going to be acquisition opportunities. I do think that there are going to be a host of portfolio considerations that could be beneficial to us. At this point we have to make sure that the organic growth stays strong and then we are investing from that standpoint and I am very eager to get back as conditions improve to a strong share repurchase program in August. At this point we need to think to settle a little bit before we do that but organic growth, acquisition, share repurchase just like in the better times \u2013 just the way, we were performing that way and we want to get back to that mode but portfolio considerations are certainly on the table.", "Barry Lucas \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Michael Meltz with JP Morgan.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "No marks for me, I will follow up with Don, thank you.", "Donald Rubin", "Yes thanks Michael on that one.", "Harold McGraw III", "Okay, if that is it, thank you all very much. We will see you as the year progresses and we certainly will be giving you everything that we have as we go but we are hoping for a better \u201909. Thank you.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning\u2019s call.

Now I\u2019d like to introduce Mr. Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the McGraw-Hill Companies.", "Donald Rubin", "Good morning to our worldwide audience and thank you for joining us for the McGraw-Hill Companies First Quarter Earnings Call. I am Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at the McGraw-Hill Companies. With me this morning are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO, and Robert Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This we issued a news release with our first quarter results. We trust you all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.McGraw-Hill.com. Before we begin this morning I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward looking statements.", "Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events.

After the presentation we will open the meeting to questions and answers. It's now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Terry McGraw", "The outlook that we have for 2009 as Don mentioned with me today is Bob Bahash our Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. On today\u2019s call I\u2019ll be reviewing the operating results and Bob will provide an in depth look at our financials.", "Earlier this morning we reported first quarter earnings. Diluted earnings per share was $0.20, revenue was $1.1 billion down 5.7% compared to the same period last year. Given the seasonality of our business, the first quarter is typically the smallest of the year which means nearly all of our earnings in 2009 are still to be achieved. ", "With the biggest part of the year ahead of us, we will spend time this morning discussing the outlook for the McGraw-Hill Companies and the importance of cost containment in this kind of environment. We are hopeful that the economy has already absorbed the biggest blows and may be bottoming out if not now, by some point this summer. The pace of decline has slowed and there are now indications that the second half will look much better then the first half.", "We are carefully monitoring the Federal Government\u2019s efforts to support the financial sector and restore confidence in credit markets. Federal stimulus programs also have an important role to play in helping states resolve their fiscal problems and improve the outlook for education budgets. Gauging the impact of the Federal initiatives on our markets is important so we\u2019re going to spend time this morning assessing recent development and what they may portend. We have a lot of ground to cover so let me get started.", "Let me begin with McGraw-Hill Education. In the first quarter our results reflected the seasonally slow start in the elementary, high school market, strong second semester ordering in the US College and university market and the impact of foreign exchange on our international business. For the segment in the first quarter revenue declined by 5.3%, stringent cost containment helped cut the operating loss by 15.7% and improved the operating margin by 300 basis points.", "Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group decreased by 11.6% and revenue for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional and International Group was off 0.7%, in constant currency, this group grew though at 6.2% rate. ", "The education market this year is still sending mixed signals. In the US college market, enrollments are growing and we still expect the market to grow by 3% to 4% and we expect to match that growth rate. In short, we are still on track to benefit from the counter cyclical performance of the college and the higher education market.", "In the elementary, high school market the outlook is more difficult to call because it\u2019s nearly impossible at this time to gauge the impact of the Federal Stimulus plan on educational spending. Without the benefit of the stimulus the el-hi market would decline this year by 15% and possibly as much as 20%. ", "A softening state new adoption market is contributing to this decline. The 2009 state new adoption market was also expected to be down because Texas is not buying new materials. A couple of months ago we estimated the market for the state new adoptions to be $675 to $725 million range. Now, however, we believe that a projection of $550 to $600 million is more realistic. This represents a decline of more than 35% from last year. ", "We are adjusting our estimate because of reduced opportunities in two key adoption states; California and Florida where many school districts have decided to postpone purchasing for budgetary reasons. The key word here is postpone.", "To be clear, the new estimate does not take into account the potential impact of any Federal Stimulus package which could make a meaningful difference in some states and some product categories. The first stimulus funding to reach the local districts will take the form of grants for IDEA special education programs and Title 1 programs for disadvantaged students. ", "Although the districts must observe certain guidelines they will have wide discretionary control over the use of the funds. We have conducted an outreach effort to schools nationwide to provide information about the grants and about McGraw-Hill products and services that would be appropriate for purchase under the guidelines. ", "The first installment of these grants was released by the US Department of Education on April 1. That would be a $6 billion for IDEA programs and $5 billion for Title 1. By law, state level agencies can keep only 4% of these funds for administrative costs. They are required to distribute the remainder to eligible districts expeditiously which should be sometime in the second quarter. Beginning in July a second round of IDEA and Title 1 grants for the same amount, $6 billion of IDEA and $5 billion for Title 1 will also be distributed. ", "Later in the second quarter we expect to have greater clarity on the states plans for using their shares of the $53.6 billion fiscal stabilization fund. This fund is intended to help the states restore cuts made to their education budgets as a result of the downturn. Saving teachers jobs is expected to be the primary focus of state spending but the money may also be used for instructional materials and assessment programs.", "The first round of this funding totaling $32.5 billion will be distributed on a state by state basis. On April 1st the states received applications that must be completed by their governors and approved by the US Department of Education before those allocations are released. The stabilization grants come with stringent reporting requirements. The Department of Education has warned that each state will receive a second allocation from the fund only after its use of the first round has been evaluated and approved.", "At this time it is almost impossible to predict the impact of the stabilization funding because state spending pattern plans and their related timelines will all vary. We could see some incremental sales funded by IDEA and Title 1 grants in the second quarter. However, the grants are likely to have the greatest impact in the third quarter. We are very well positioned in both the Special Education and the Title 1 markets and we expect to capture a significant share of district spending on instructional and assessment programs.", "The new fiscal year starts for 46 states on July 1. Education budgets are still taking shape in most legislatures. These new state budgets will play a major role in determining the volume of purchasing in the second half of this year. ", "There is yet another variable that will affect educational funding in 2009. In mid March the President signed an omnibus spending bill that included a final fiscal year 2009 budget for the Department of Education\u2019s discretionary programs which had been temporarily funded at 2008 levels through continuing resolutions by Congress. The new budget provided for the first significant increase in several years raising total spending by 7%. ", "Important beneficiaries were the IDEA program for special education with a 5.5% increase to $11.5 billion, and Title 1 for disadvantaged students, with an increase of 4.3% to $14.5 billion. These sums are in addition to the funds already provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Stimulus Bill. Judging by everything that we have heard, the administrations long term educational priorities create very favorable opportunities for educational publishers. ", "On the most basic level, the increases in federal assistance, especially from federally mandated programs such as IDEA will remove some of the financial stress from state and local educational agencies which in recent years had to meet inflationary increases out of their own pockets. Beyond that, the proposed commitment to early childhood education should enlarge the market. Our company is well prepared to serve. In addition, Secretary Duncan\u2019s office has promised that there will be a broader program of support for primary grade reading. ", "There\u2019s also new emphasis on college and workforce readiness preparation which will help revitalize areas of the secondary curriculum. These developments bode well for education. They also underscore what most politicians and corporate leader already understand, that investing in education is essential for the US to remain globally competitive.", "In the short term, we have to deal with some funding pressures and that means cost containment will be a priority for us all year. The majority of the first quarter\u2019s el-hi sales for the industry as well as for McGraw-Hill School Education Group are made up of residual and supplemental purchases, categories that have been under pressure for several months.", "North Carolina is the only adoption state that places substantial orders for new materials in the first quarter and our success in the state last year made year over year comparisons more difficult. North Carolina also reduced the size of its math adoption this year by postponing the 6th through 12th purchasing and electing to buy only K-5 materials. We are not taking significant share in this adoption. Overall, however, we expect to be very competitive in this year\u2019s state new adoption market and our goal is to capture 30% of the total available dollars in this market.", "The largest state new adoption opportunities in 2009 were offered by the first year K-8 reading and literature and second year K-8 math adoptions in California, and the first year 6-12 reading and literature adoption in Florida. As I pointed out earlier, these markets have softened. Both states give school districts two years in which to buy newly state listed materials. In both states, nearly 80% of the districts have decided to postpone new purchases until next year. ", "California districts that were due to buy math in the second year have been requested and receiving waivers to postpone these purchases until a third year. These decisions represent a significant departure from historical implementation patterns. Furthermore, the legislatures in both states have enacted temporary flexibility provisions that will allow districts to use 2009 instructional material allocations for other educational purposes if they choose.", "It is probable that the Federal Stimulus funds that will be distributed in the second and third quarters will cause some districts to reconsider their decisions but it is impossible at time obviously to predict whether the stimulus funds will wholly or even largely reverse the trend toward postponement.", "Fortunately, McGraw-Hill is strongly positioned in other adoption states; specifically we\u2019re doing very well with reading in Georgia, science in Tennessee, social studies in Indiana, and math in South Carolina, Kentucky and Oregon. Even though there are fewer opportunities in California and Florida, we expect to capture meaningful shares of the available business in those states.", "All things considered, the stimulus funds and the postponements will have a positive effect next year when we expect the state new adoption market opportunity to hit $1 billion. The 2010 new state adoption market will be driven by Texas K-12 reading, literature and language arts. The legislature is currently in session and will set the next bi-annual budget. The situation is still fluid but there is support by the governor and the senate for full funding through the use of federal stimulus funds.", "Florida K-12 math, 2010, the new math standards have been issued by the state Department of Education for use in annual summative tests, those are the high stakes test. The current math materials in Florida classrooms do not align with the new standards. Attempts to delay the math adoption have been turned back.", "California second year reading, normally California spends at least 40% of its adoption dollars in the first year and 40% in the second year. In 2009 only 20% to 25% of the first year of reading adoption will be realized. We expect about a 40% buy in 2010. Because of delays in the second year of the math adoption we expect incremental purchasing in that discipline too. Better days lie ahead in the state new adoption market in 2010, followed by another promising state new adoption schedule in 2011. We continue to estimate that 2011 opportunity will top $1 billion as well.", "In testing, we continue to make progress with Acuity, that\u2019s our formative assessment program. LAS Links, our assessment program for English language learners, and TABE CLAS-E which measures English language proficiency in adults. We have just won the first statewide adoption for this new product in Arizona. ", "We\u2019re getting market feedback that the Federal Stimulus funds will be a plus for testing. Some states that were considering cutbacks are now planning to keep programs in place or to resume programs that had been cancelled. Acuity and LAS Links should benefit from the new administration\u2019s focus on real time assessment and the availability of stimulus money. Both products fit will and within the federal guidelines for Title 1 and IDEA spending.", "In the US College and university business we saw solid first quarter growth in revenue for both traditional and electronic products. Sales in this period reflected the success we experienced in last fall\u2019s campaigns for second semester sales. All major disciplines showed improvement with the greatest percentage gain occurring in the for profit post secondary market. The quarter over quarter comparison also benefited this year from a timing shift as more orders move from December into January and February. ", "As we pointed out earlier in these remarks, the US college market is poised for more growth this year. We have widespread reports of increased enrollment at post secondary institutions across the country. The largest increases are occurring in public rather than private schools and particularly in community colleges where students concentrate on developing specific job skills.", "The Federal Stimulus package contains several provisions that will help post secondary students meet expenses. The maximum Pell grant award for eligible students has been increased from $4,731 to $5,350. There\u2019s an increased support for work study programs affording students part time jobs on campuses. Students or their families will be able to claim a tax credit of up to $2,500 for tuition and related expenses including course materials. With the approval of the Department of Education, states can use some of their fiscal stabilization fund grants to restore cuts in their higher education budgets.", "In professional markets, economic conditions have led retailers to reduce inventory and limit new orders but digital products in both the higher education and professional markets continue to produce double digit gains.", "Summing up for McGraw-Hill Education, without factoring in any benefit from the Federal Stimulus package, we see a 15% to 20% decline the el-hi market and a 3% to 4% growth in the US college and university market. ", "For the segment, we now project revenue decline of 7% to 8% versus our previous guidance of low single digit decrease in revenue but we are maintaining our previous margin guidance of a 300 to 400 basis point decline excluding the 2008 restructuring charges. This implies low single digit decline in expenses and an operating margin of 9% to 10%. Again, we\u2019re not putting any factor at this point of any federal stimulus monies into our forecast. We\u2019ll see as we get into the second quarter.", "In Financial Services, surging investment grade corporate issuance primarily in the industrial sector, weakness in structured finance and modest growth in the S&P Investment Services were key factors in our first quarter performance. For the first quarter, revenue declined 5.3%, operating profit decreased 12.3% and the operating margin was 38.0%. Revenue for the S&P credit market services was off 8.4% and revenue for S&P Investment Services was up about 1%.", "Conditions in the bond market remain unsettled, although some see the pickup in the first quarter corporate issuance as a sign that confidence may be returning to the credit markets. Increased corporate activity and the establishment of a series of government led programs to provide attractive terms for issuers and investors are certainly welcome developments.", "US Government programs now cover virtually the entire funding mix in financial markets and the programs are for commercial paper termed unsecured debts, deposits, secured borrowing at bank and broker dealers as well as equity capital. ", "By now we have all heard the initials of the most of the programs including TALF and TARP and TLGP. It\u2019s not surprising these government efforts have been labeled the acronym credit market relief program.", "At this point it\u2019s fair to say that these programs have been most helpful. Obviously any actions that help restore confidence to the market are obviously welcome. For now the programs have had only a modest impact on our business and while we are not expecting any windfalls from these programs we are committed to working with policy makers and market participants around the world to help get capital markets on track.", "In an effort to stabilize the short end of the market, the Federal Reserve implemented four programs designed to help the asset backed commercial paper markets. These programs have been extended through October and generally have been effective stabilizing the short end of the market is obviously going to help the stability of the longer term credit.", "As this graph shows, we have not seen any increase in asset backed commercial paper issuance. We have seen the term asset backed securities loan facility or TALF product some modest activity in the first quarter. Because the deals are big, they are subject to fee caps. In the first quarter S&P was paid less than one basis point for rating $7 billion worth of TALF eligible securities. ", "We understand that after a disappointing April, a bigger round of funding for TALF programs is shaping up in May and these include deals for student loans, credit cards, auto loans, auto leases in the asset backed area. The FDIC\u2019s Temporary Liquid Guarantee Program or TLGP had a more significant but still modest impact on our business then TALF. The TLGP program encouraged the issuance of rated deals based on government guarantees. ", "As this chart shows, the first quarter increase in the issuance of US Corporates was a key element of S&P credit market services performance. US Corporate new issue dollar buy in was up 13.9% in the first quarter driven by a 23.4% increase in the industrial sector. If you look at the issuance sequentially, corporate new issue dollar volume in the first quarter in the United States market increased 69% over the fourth quarter of 2008. Industrial issuance was up 143.4% sequentially.", "Four factors contributed to the pickup in investment grade corporate debt. Pent up investor appetite for yield, a rebound in merger and acquisition activity, refinancing as many corporations address maturing long term debt, and a narrowing of spread since December.

A lack of new money from banks and corporate decisions to avoid refinancing risk over the next 18 months produced a single quarter record issuance on $220 billion in Europe for industrials.", "In today\u2019s market liquidity is a key. Solid companies with strong balance sheets can borrow at reasonable rates but the market has not been open to everyone. Many lower rated companies must pay steep rates to borrow and others are shut out completely. In the industrial market, issuers and investors remain cautious and issuance is expected to remain lumpy until stability returns to the financial system.", "For financial institutions times are still not normal, banks are de-leveraging balance sheets and shrinking liabilities. We expect this trend to continue. Despite the pressures on the banks, we expect modest lending growth. Banks want to maintain their franchises. Hereto, government aid packages are encouraging banks to support local economies. Libor spread remain the relevant cost of funds benchmark. In recent months we\u2019ve seen Libor rates stabilize.", "US speculative grade issuance jumped by 55% in the first quarter but there were not many deals. Under current conditions we expect speculative grade issuance to remain somewhat limited. Public finance tends to be counter cyclical to the US economy and the fundamentals point to another good year in issuance assuming interest rates remain relatively low.", "Rating requests for state and local government continue at a steady pace but I also must point out that the second quarter issuance last year was the largest in muni history so the immediate comparisons are challenging. ", "As this chart shows, there was not much activity in the US structured finance market in the first quarter. The structured finance market will be challenging probably all year both here and abroad with continued weakness in most asset classes with the exception of the asset backed market. In the US residential mortgage backed security market activity takes the form of re-remics as financial institutions seek ways to improve balance sheet capital requirements. ", "Government programs like TALF and PIPP may stimulate some of that transaction volume. In the first quarter there was no activity in the commercial mortgage backed securities market. While spreads have tightened recently in response to government intervention they are still too wide to produce new securitizations. This market will return but slowly.", "By comparison, the pipeline and the asset backed securities market looks relatively healthy. As I pointed out earlier, the TALF program is having some impact here. We anticipate further recovery of credit markets continue to stabilize. The market for collateralized debt obligations will be muted all year.", "Unsettled conditions in the credit markets reduced transaction revenue in the first quarter by 18.3%. Our report of transaction revenue at S&P now includes bank loan ratings and corporate credit estimates as well as publicly issued debt.

Non-transaction revenue again includes annual contracts, surveillance fees and subscriptions.", "The main factors for the first quarter decline were the impact of foreign exchange and a reduction in fees on cancelled transactions, breakup fees. Bob will review non-transaction revenue in more detail in just a moment and why we now expect it to decline slightly this year versus our previous guidance of 1% to 2% growth.", "We are maintaining our guidance of a 10% to 12% decline in transaction revenue as comparisons get easier in the second half and foreign exchange comparisons will not be as challenging. S&P credit market services international revenue declined by 13% in the first quarter but was off only 3.9% in constant currency. That compares with a 4.2% decline in credit market services domestic revenue.", "For S&P credit market services, we now expect a low single digit decline in revenue versus our previous guidance of a slight decline in the face of the credit market conditions that I\u2019ve described so far this morning. Revenue at S&P investment services grew by 0.8% in the first quarter as gains at index services and capital IQ offset softness in investment research products for the retail market and lower demand for fund management rating from European funds.

Certainly the highest should be transparency, prevention of conflicts, quality, breadth of coverage, market scrutiny, and of course investor choice. You can find that white paper again on the home page of S&Ps website at www.StandardandPoors.com.", "At the SEC roundtable on April 15th there were 26 panelists from the rating industry, academia, and the financial services industry.

", "It\u2019s not clear when the regulation will take effect but it could be as early as July, after it has been reviewed in detail by the European Commission\u2019s lawyers and translated into all 23 official languages of the European Union. After that, the credit rating agencies would have nine months to adopt the necessary measures to comply with the provisions and apply for registration in the European Union.", "As far as formal procedural steps are concerned, a political sign off by European finance ministers is likely to take place on May 5th with a final sign off of the text in October.", "After regulations come into force, the committee of European regulators known as CESR will within six months issue guidelines on a range of issues including the application process and treatment of ratings issued outside the European Union.

Clearly more will be required of S&P and other credit rating agencies issuing ratings which are used by European market participants. The important take away here is that on balance the new regulations are very manageable and represent a level playing field for credit rating agencies operating in the European Union.", "The European Commission\u2019s work is not over. Within three years of the regulation coming into force it must deliver an assessment on how the regulation is working, what affect it is having on credit rating agency competition, and the appropriateness of the issuer paid model.

There will be an oral argument in connection with our motion to dismiss the Oddo lawsuit on May 13th. It is anticipated that oral arguments in connection with our motions to dismiss other pending cases will be scheduled by the courts over the next couple of months.", "Again, as we said previously the lawsuits fall into three broad categories; the first are underwriter claims and these are based on the Securities Act of 1933. This category includes a number of class actions by purchasers of sub-prime residential mortgage backed securities rated by S&P as well as one case involving Fannie Mae ratings. ", "These cases assert claims that Standard & Poor\u2019s is libel as an underwriter or as a seller of securities under the section 11 and/or section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933. Clearly, S&P is not an underwriter or seller of any securities. The company intends to seek early dismissals of each of these actions. One underwriter case has already been voluntarily dismissed and we were recently removed as a defendant from another one.", "The second category, these are the McGraw-Hill shareholder claims and these categories includes class actions under the 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act. We refer to this action as the Reese case. It has been brought up by purchasers of McGraw-Hill stock who allege that company statements about its earnings and ratings business were misleading. A motion to dismiss this action has been filed and we expect to present oral arguments again in the next couple of months. There are two other cases that involve essentially the same facts. We expect all the necessary papers will be filed with the courts by June. ", "The third category are the state law claims, these include a group of cases asserting state law claims including fraud relating to S&Ps ratings of a variety of securities including SIVs, SIV-Lites, CDOs, Lehman Brother debt. In one of these cases the Oddo Asset Management versus Barclays Bank PLC pending in the New York Supreme Court, McGraw-Hill has moved to dismiss the allegations asserting first amendment protection for its ratings opinions as well as other legal defenses under New York law.", "In addition to the three categories already sighted there are other cases which include a complaint filed with HUD under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and actions filed in Israel and Italy relating to Lehman Brothers. The company is currently preparing its legal responses to those matters and also will be looking for early release.", "In looking at this lineup of pending lawsuits you can only wonder why some of our critics continue to make erroneous assertion that S&P or other credit rating agencies are somehow immune from litigation or potentially legal liability this is simply not the case. We have always been subject to potential liability under the fraud provisions of the Federal Securities law. Moreover, over the years private plaintiffs have asserted claims under a number of additional legal theories including the Securities Act of 1933, breach of contract and a wide range of common law and statutory cause of action. ", "S&P and other credit rating agencies are also subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission which also has the legal authority to sanction rating agencies. The situation couldn\u2019t be clearer; the frequently repeated media sound bites by rating agency critics simply do not match the facts regarding the legal framework within which S&P operates on a daily basis.", "Importantly, we continue to assess the legal risk as low. We also do not believe that any new or currently proposed legislation, regulation or judicial determination would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition or results of operations.", "Let me sum up for financial services. A change in revenue guidance but not in the operating margin. Low single digit decline in revenue for S&P credit market services, single digit revenue growth for S&P investment services, a slight decline in revenue for the financial services segment, a margin decline of 250 to 300 basis points excluding the 2008 restructuring charges, low single digit growth in expenses versus our previous guidance of 6% growth, an implied operating margin of approximately 38% for 2009.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at Information & Media. Certainly a decline in advertising, strength in global energy market, and a revenue deferral were all key factors in this segments first quarter performance. Revenue decline 7.4%, operating profit decreased 76% and the operating margin was down by 360 basis points. Revenue for the business to business group was off 5.7% and revenue for the broadcasting dropped 22.9%.", "In the first quarter, $4.7 million of revenue and $2.3 million of operating profit was deferred and will be recognized ratably over a 12 month service period at J.D. Power and Associates, Bob will have more details on this deferral later in just a moment. ", "Advertising was soft as BusinessWeek and with our construction and aviation publications as well with two fewer issues this year in the first quarter BusinessWeek ad pages obviously were going to be more impacted and were down 39.8%. That\u2019s measured by Publishers Information Bureau, PIB.", "In the business to business group, Platts continues to turn in very solid results with critical services for oil, natural gas, and power markets. In a volatile market there is growing appetite for Platts real time services which include breaking news, market analysis and price assessments. Demand also continues to grow for Platts\u2019 Dispatch, that\u2019s our end of day pricing service. With one click, customers receive our end of day price assessments, third party data, and a rolling 45 day historical database. Because the global energy market never sleeps, our service is available 24/7 365 days a year.", "Turmoil in the automotive market impacted J.D. Power and Associates and our Broadcasting group. In Broadcasting a decline in automotive advertising contributed to the decrease in local and national advertising in the first quarter. Comparisons obviously were not helped by the predictable absence of political advertising in a non-election year. ", "Therefore, summing up for Information & Media we now expect a decline by 5% to 6% versus our previous guidance of a low single digit decrease in revenue but we\u2019re maintaining our previous March end guidance of 200 to 300 basis points decline excluding the 2008 restructuring charge.", "That wraps it up for the review of the operations so let\u2019s sum up for the corporation. For 2009 we see revenue declining 4% to 5% versus our previous guidance of a decline of 1% to 2%. Based on tight expense controls we are maintaining our earnings per share guidance of $2.20 to $2.30. You also want to note some modest changes this year as we have implemented a new accounting pronouncement, this is SFAS 160. ", "Operating margins for 2008 have been restated and our reported margins for the first quarter 2009 and our guidance reflect the new accounting pronouncement. Bob will provide a little bit more detail on the impact of SFAS 160 in his remarks.", "Let me turn now to Bob who will be talking and having more to say about the controlling costs and expenses.", "Robert Bahash", "In the current environment liquidity is key and our position is strong. We will discuss this in more detail later but first let\u2019s start with operations. In the guidance we provided this morning we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year while maintaining our original guidance for earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.30 for 2009. Obviously to achieve our EPS guidance in face of reduced revenue expectations we must manage to keep a firm grip on costs and expenses. Consolidated expenses were down 4% in the first quarter and that\u2019s not a bad start.", "This year, foreign exchange will be a key factor for both revenue and expenses. In the first quarter it reduced revenue by $37.4 million and cut the rate of growth by three percentage points. Foreign exchange benefited year over year expenses comparisons by $49.5 million and pre-tax income by $12.1 million. ", "These different top and bottom line outcomes occurred because we primarily bill, in many cases, in US dollars and Euros while significant expenses are denominated in non-US dollars. For example, the British Pound has significantly weakened compared to the US dollar. The average US dollar to British Pound exchange rate in the first quarter was down 27% year over year. We expect the impact of foreign exchange on revenue and expenses to lessen in the second half of the year.", "In constant currency first quarter consolidated expenses will be roughly flat year over year as continued investment in our business was mitigated by savings at all three segments, as a result of the 2007 and 2008 restructuring actions, continued cost containment, and lower expenses at McGraw-Hill Education, some of which is timing related.", "We\u2019ve also benefited from a slight year over year decline in incentive compensation. As indicated during the last earnings call, incentive compensation comparisons will become more challenging in the second half since we brought down long term and short term accruals in the later part of 2008.", "Let\u2019s now look at the segment\u2019s first quarter results as well as the new guidance for revenue and expenses. I\u2019ll begin with McGraw-Hill Education. The segment\u2019s expenses were down 7.6% year over year in the first quarter but they were skewed by timing of sales and marketing expenses which in some cases will shift to the second and third quarters of 2009. We are maintaining our previous margin guidance of a 300 to 400 basis point decline excluding 2008 restructuring charges.", "We have taken a closer look at Education expenses. Instead of our previous guidance of expenses roughly flat we now expect the low single digit decline for the full year. The segment will benefit from restructuring actions taken in 2007 and 2008, the absence of data center migration costs, lower marketing costs due to reduced opportunities in the adoption market, and reduced variable costs as a result of reduced revenue opportunities. The benefits will be partially offset by higher plant amortization in 2009 and increased investment at Higher Education with its greater emphasis on digit products. ", "A final word on our revenue guidance for the Education segment, last year ordering did accelerate in the second quarter. As a result, School Education Group\u2019s revenue grew 6.9%. We do not expect that pattern to repeat this year which means that revenue comparisons for the School Education Group will be particularly challenging in the second quarter of 2009.", "In the Financial Services Segment, we not project a slight decline in revenue for the year and there are several reasons for a change in the forecast. First, we now expect a low single digit decline in revenue at Standard and Poor\u2019s Credit Market Services or CMS instead of a slight decline. For CMS we report both transaction and non-transaction revenue. We are maintaining our guidance of 10% to 12% decline in transaction revenue despite an 18.3% decrease in the first quarter because comparisons will get easier in the second half.", "For non-transaction revenue there was a decline of 3.8% in the first quarter. This was driven by a significant impact of foreign exchange as well as a reduction in fees for work performed on cancelled transactions. We expect to earn less of these fees in 2009 then last year. The amount earned in 2008 was larger in the first half of the year then in the second half with the largest amount earned in the second quarter. ", "Just to give you a better understanding of these fees, S&P collects fees under many client agreements as it completes certain milestones in the process of determining a rating for a particular transaction. In practice, S&P typically waits until a debt is issued and then builds and collects the entire rating fee. However, if the issuer decides to cancel a transaction and not issue the debt S&P is permitted to bill and collect the applicable fees for services performed. ", "Historically these fees have been greater for structured finance transactions then for corporate transactions. Since the structured market was hit hardest by the credit crunch it saw a larger number of cancelled deals. Furthermore, international fees for work performed on cancelled transactions have been greater then domestic fees. Given slightly lower growth projections for surveillance and subscription fees we now expect non-transaction revenue this year to decline slightly versus our previous guidance of 1% to 2% growth. ", "There\u2019s one more point to make about our transaction and non-transaction revenue at CMS. While it has no material impact on guidance we reclassified bank loan ratings and corporate credit estimates in CMS revenue from non-transaction to transaction. We reclassified these items to create a more accurate view of our transaction revenue which previously have been limited to public new issuance. We have provided an exhibit in the earnings release showing transaction and non-transaction revenue by quarter for 2008. ", "As Terry indicated, we are reducing our revenue guidance for S&P Investment Services from high single digit growth to single digit growth. While Index Services and Capital IQ continue to perform strongly we have seen softening in Investment Research, including equity research outsourcing support due to continued deterioration in the economy.", "Investment Services revenue grew slightly this quarter but experienced a small sequential decline. While most of Investment Services bills in US dollars CRISIL and our European operations were adversely impacted by the strong US dollar. Results were also impacted by the divestiture of CRISIL\u2019s Gas Strategies Group which occurred last year.", "Despite our lower revenue expectations for Financial Services we are maintaining our previous margin guidance of a 250 to 300 basis point decline excluding 2008 restructuring charges. This implies a low single digit increase in expenses versus our previous guidance of 6% growth.", "For the first quarter, expenses were down 0.4% year over year. Adjusting for currency, expenses were up $25.9 million or 6.8%. The increase is being driven by the full year impact of 2008 hires, primarily in India at CRISIL and Capital IQ Data Collection Operation, continued investments in our fast growing businesses though at a reduced pace, and increased compliance and regulatory costs. Partially offsetting these are benefits of the restructuring actions.", "Now for Information & Media, I\u2019d like to remind you that the segments results for the year will be adversely affected by the non-cash accounting impact at J.D. Power related to the introduction of Comp-us a more robust reporting an analytical tool for our clients.", "Revenue previously recognized at the time the syndicated studies release will now be recognized ratably over the 12 month life of the subscription. This of course is similar to the Suites transition that we had previously talked about in 2006. For the full year, we continue to expect a $15 million decline in revenue and $10 million decline in profit due to the impact of Comp-us. For the first quarter this change resulted in a $4.7 million decline in revenue and a $2.3 million decline in profit. ", "Despite our lower revenue guidance for the Information & Media segment we are maintaining our earlier forecast of a 200 to 300 basis point decline in the segments margin excluding the 2008 restructuring charges. This essentially implies a low single digit decline in expenses for the year versus our previous guidance of virtually no growth.", "In the first quarter we adopted SFAS 160 non-controlling interests and consolidated financial statements which resulted in a reclassification of minority interest. Previously we had minority interest recorded in segment operating profit. Under SFAS 160 we now separately report net income attributable to non-controlling interests as a new line below net income.", "While the change has no impact on earnings per share or on margin guidance on an overall basis, the reclassifications do modestly impact operating profit and margins for McGraw-Hill Education and the Financial Services segments. To facilitate comparisons for this revised presentation we have restated 2008 by quarter in exhibit five of this morning\u2019s release.", "Corporate expenses in the first quarter were $33.4 million roughly flat to the $33.9 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect that corporate expenses will increase this year by $25 to $30 million largely a reflection of increased stock based and short term incentive compensation.", "There also are changes in the company\u2019s effective tax rate. Last January I indicated that the effective tax rate for 2009 would decline 50 basis points from 37.5% to 37.0%. The drivers of the lower tax rate remain the same. The continued higher growth in our international operations has a favorable impact on the rate and we also formed Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC, a Delaware limited Liability company to operate most of the US S&P businesses. In addition to operational benefits we expect the new structure to be more tax efficient.", "Due to the impact of SFAS 160 the effective tax rate for the full year 2008 was recalculated as 36.9%. We still expect a 50 basis point decline for the effective tax rate which results in a rate of approximately 36.4% for 2009.", "Let\u2019s now review free cash flow. To calculate free cash flow we start with after tax cash from operations and deduct investments and dividends. What\u2019s left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or simply pay down debt. We indicated in January that we expect free cash flow for the year to be in the range of $430 to $450 million. That\u2019s approximately equal to last year despite lower profits due to easier working capital comparisons and our focus on prudent investments.", "In the first quarter of 2009 free cash flow improved by $207 million relative to the prior year. In the first quarter, free cash flow is generally negative due to the seasonality of our businesses but as we had anticipated our free cash outflow was substantially lower than prior year driven by significant reduction in incentive compensation payments and more favorable working capital comparisons, particularly for inventories. For 2009 we still expect free cash flow in the range of $430 to $450 million. ", "The free cash flow guidance does not reflect any pension plan contributions. The US plan is now underfunded following last year\u2019s significant market declines. We will follow the guidance from the government agencies regarding contribution formula changes. They are still being reviewed. Based on current expectations we may have no funding requirement in 2009. If one is required, it could be up to $30 million which is lower then our previous guidance of $30 to $50 million. If funding is required it would be payable in the second half of the year.", "Let me recap the corporation\u2019s financial position. Our liquidity position is strong; there is cash on the balance sheet as well as a commercial paper program in place that is supported by a backup credit facility. As needed, we can access the commercial paper market at reasonable rates. ", "On a gross basis, total debt at the end of March was $1.36 billion. This is comprised of the $1.2 billion in unsecured senior notes issued in 2007 as well as about $160 million in commercial paper. This is offset by $497 million in cash, primarily in foreign holdings. The first long term debt payment is not due until the end of 2012 and the majority of our long term debt matures in 2017 and beyond. Our net debt at the end of March was $861 million up from $796 million at year end. This increase is due to the seasonal cash requirements in the first quarter.", "Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 312 million in the first quarter and 11.4 million share decline versus the same period last year. It is also roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter 2008. The year over year decline is primarily due to 2008 share repurchases and to a lesser extent the decline in our stock price. The figure for fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter was approximately 312 million shares.", "Interest expense was $20.6 million in the first quarter which is slightly higher compared to $17.8 million in the same period last year. For the full year we still expect interest expense to be roughly comparable to 2008.", "Capital expenditures are expected to decline in 2009. Prepublication investments were $42.7 million in the first quarter which is down $24 million compared to the first quarter of 2008. We still expect prepub investments to be $225 million in 2009 versus $254 million in 2008. Reduced revenue opportunities in 2009, prudent investments, and continued offshoring benefits are all factors.", "Purchases of property and equipment were $8 million in the first quarter compared to $23.6 million in the same period last year. The first quarter 2008 included capital expenditures related to the data center. We continue to estimate $90 million for the full year.", "Let\u2019s now review non-cash items. Amortization of prepub costs in the first quarter was $27.3 million which is approximately $1 million lower than the same period last year. For the full year, we expect a reduction in prepub amortization from $275 to $280 million versus our original forecast of $285 million.", "Depreciation was $29.4 million and that\u2019s about $2 million higher then the same period last year. We\u2019re still forecasting approximately $130 million for the year.", "Amortization of intangibles was $14.2 million for the first quarter which is flat compared to the same period last year. For 2009 we still expect approximately $55 million.", "I\u2019ll conclude with a comment on unearned revenue. Unearned revenue ended the quarter of 2009 at $1.1 billion which is roughly flat with the prior year. In constant currency it grew 3.6%. At the end of the first quarter, Financial Services comprised 74.1% of the corporation\u2019s total unearned revenue. Given the lower revenue guidance we now expect unearned revenue to grow minimally in 2009 versus our original forecast of low single digit year over year growth.", "Thank you and now back to Terry.", "Terry McGraw", "There you have it for the first quarter for this year, obviously a small quarter for us overall. We\u2019re pleased with the $0.20 for the quarter given the environment that we\u2019ve been in. We see the economy overall starting to improve, that the rate of decline will decline and maybe even show positive GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Credit markets are starting to unthaw and government support which we don\u2019t have in our numbers; government support for state education numbers I think will be very helpful as well. This is definitely going to be a first half; second half and we\u2019re looking for improved environments on that. ", "Let me turn it now over to Don and we\u2019ll go to any questions.", "Donald Rubin", "Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. (Instructions) We\u2019re now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "At Investment Services can you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing in that business? I know you gave a lot of detail on the call but in terms of what\u2019s working and what\u2019s weak can you talk about the weak properties such as the directories and managed funds and the research products. What exactly are you seeing there and what gives you confidence that that\u2019s somewhat stabilized?", "Robert Bahash", "The areas that were not performing as strongly as the others are the relatively smaller properties, the equity research piece, which as you know has been challenged. The funds research side was also relatively small. The important thing is that in this environment with a very, very difficult situation for the Financial Services industry Capital IQ saw modest but still growth in their annualized contract, I think that\u2019s very important.", "We\u2019re also seeing stability in Compustat as well. Our index product offerings are even with the significant declines that we saw in assets under management which affects overall fees we\u2019re still seeing opportunities there and we expect that to be pretty strong for the balance of the year. On an overall basis we\u2019re pleased with the performance given the market environment that we\u2019re seeing.", "Again, it\u2019s the equity research areas which are both domestically here as well as CRISIL which provides some outsourcing equity research capabilities mainly for some European clients it saw some weakness, some pull back. They are seeing some additional properties coming their way. Those are smaller areas that did not perform as well.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Is there a way to tell us percent of revenues that grew versus percent of revenues that declined or something like that?", "Robert Bahash", "This is a broader portfolio and I don\u2019t want to get into the different component pieces. I think its safe to say that the areas that we\u2019re looking at as the growth engines performed at our expectations or quite frankly even a little bit better given the very difficult environment that we\u2019re in. We are encouraged for the balance of the year as we start to get some stability in the market environment.", "Terry McGraw", "On the index side even though there was a little bit of softness in some of the traditional exchange traded funds there was still a fair bit of activity. The new commodity component is off to a very good start and I think that a lot of investors are looking for those kinds of basket investments. Capital IQ is up to 2,700 clients and is adding clients as we go so its coming from more traditional sources maybe but we\u2019re pleased with both of those, those are good signals I think to the market.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "The SFAS 160 adjustment, what are the entities that you\u2019re now shifting to a minority interest line, what are those investments at S&P and Education?", "Robert Bahash", "The larger entities would be CRISIL, there\u2019s Taiwan Ratings, and of course in Education it would be the McGraw-Hill Ryerson, the Canadian operation those are the larger components that are being shifted.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "At Information Media we saw yesterday that Advance is closing portfolio. Can you talk about BusinessWeek and with pages down this much what are you doing there to kind of stem the losses, I would think it\u2019s on track to lose a good amount of money this year.", "Terry McGraw", "No comment on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "With the expiration of the global settlement how big of a revenue hit do you take from that on the equity research side of the business?", "Robert Bahash", "This is a relatively small property. We have not seen growth in the revenue here. Let\u2019s put it this way, you\u2019re somewhere under $20 million.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "To the ratings business are you seeing specific pricing pressure back from issuers in response to the more difficult market condition? Generally, what are you guys doing this year from a pricing perspective?", "Terry McGraw", "It all depends on the category within that. Given some of the strength that we\u2019re seeing on the corporate side both here and in Europe the European one is very pleasing to see. We are selectively putting in price increases. Obviously in the areas where there is much lower demand we\u2019re trying to maintain whatever pricing levels at that point. We are selectively increasing in those categories that produce more demand.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Do you have an estimate in terms of what the incremental costs of the various regulations that have been put into place might be?", "Robert Bahash", "I really don\u2019t want to get into that at this point we\u2019re still developing that but clearly as you could expect we\u2019re spending a fair amount of money in that particular area. I don\u2019t want to get into that at this point in time. Perhaps as we get further through and we have better clarity in terms of what the new regulatory environment will be.", "Terry McGraw", "It\u2019s also safe to say we have estimated where we think we are and it\u2019s in the 38% margin.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Do you anticipate that you might have to do additional restructuring actions to get to the cost targets you\u2019ve now set?", "Terry McGraw", "There\u2019s no further restructuring built into our current forecast. Again, we think things are going to be generally improving here. Again, I think the proper answer to that is that if obviously opportunities don\u2019t appear where we see them we will adjust the costs accordingly. I just think it\u2019s probably safe to say don\u2019t know at this point but certainly we\u2019re coming to more closure on that.", "Robert Bahash", "Given the environment that we\u2019re faced with this year and the high level of uncertainty each one of our segments as well as the different corporate areas created rather significant contingency plans with regard to their expense portfolios. In many cases we have implemented some of those contingency actions just because of the uncertainty that we\u2019re facing. That\u2019s why we are right now forecasting virtually in every case a lower expectation for expense growth then we had originally indicated. ", "Because the environment\u2019s a little bit different, our revenue expectation for the full year is a little bit lower then we thought so that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of ahead of the curve here with regard to our expense contingency implementations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Huber \u2013 Barclays", "Craig Huber \u2013 Barclays", "Can you speak a little bit about European regulatory further? I thought it very interesting in the recent weeks that the European Commission and various bodies did not change the business model for the credit rating agencies over in Europe. What do you think that mean for the SEC Congress here in the States if anything that they may or may not change their business model in the States?", "Terry McGraw", "This has been a process now that\u2019s taken almost two years. In the beginning it was way off with lots and lots of agreement and disagreement and all hosts of different ideas. We were very pleased with the outcome on the European Regulatory front. As things started to settle and time passed there was a much better understanding of what good regulation should be, smart regulation. At the G20 they reaffirmed the designation process and a code of conduct requirements from IOSCO and CESR has taken on a much broader role and could be the regulatory body for pan European focus on that part. Very simple on that part.", "I think that also speaks very, very well coming back to the SEC that you want to see some complementary approaches here and I think that there\u2019ll be sort of a melding that takes place. Again, on the business model issue and again we put out that white paper. Every business model whatever it\u2019s an issuer paid, investor paid, utility models, whatever, they all have pros and cons and they all have the potential for conflict and you have to be able to satisfy yourself that you\u2019re managing that potential conflict.", "It depends on what you\u2019re trying to solve the equation for. If it\u2019s for higher transparency then the issuer paid model is the better approach to take. That\u2019s exactly what the European, after a lot of debate, the European approach took.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Barclays", "Could we talk about near term new issuance trends here in April? It\u2019s my understanding the last three weeks in April have been quite weak in terms of new issuance in Europe and in the States here, among three weakest weeks we\u2019ve had since you know fourth quarter and stuff. Obviously there\u2019s some volatility or slowness around blackout dates on earnings and so forth. Are you seeing that in your business as well in April so far?", "Terry McGraw", "The word that we used, we were very pleased obviously with the way the first quarter new issuance in the corporate industrial side both here in the United States and Europe came about. It was certainly sounding on investment grade securities the unthawing of the markets and the M&A activity associated with that was starting to pick up. We\u2019re also looking for a signal from the high yield market. We have seen some in Europe and we want to see where that continues.", "The word I used was lumpy because one doesn\u2019t know and you\u2019ll probably go in and out of some phases. Overall we think we\u2019re seeing a pretty good signal here that things are starting to unthaw. We\u2019re talking corporates and governments and public finance. We\u2019re not talking structured here. We do expect to see some improvement in the asset backed securities market especially for student loans, auto loans, credit card receivables etc.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Barclays", "Are you seeing any slowness in the last three weeks versus what you saw in the first quarter?", "Terry McGraw", "We\u2019re seeing some on that. Corporates on the industrial sector are still showing activity on this part. We\u2019ll have to see how it projects as we get into May. We\u2019re pleased with where we are.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Barclays", "You mentioned early on in the call that you thought the adoption market would be down about 35% for the year. Maybe I missed it but what is your expectation for the open territories for elementary, high school textbooks in the US.", "Terry McGraw", "Actually we\u2019re pleased and I\u2019ve gone through a whole host of things where we were talking about reading in Georgia and science in Tennessee and social studies in Indiana, math in South Carolina, Kentucky and Oregon on that one. It will probably do better then the state adoption market but well have to see. We\u2019ll have to see what the Federal Stimulus package; we just don\u2019t have any data on that.", "The monies are out, we\u2019re going to see them obviously in this quarter and the third quarter. We\u2019ve got to see what kind of impact that does. It\u2019s a lot of money, its $104 billion, and $54 billion going back to the states specifically for this support. Obviously a lot of that money is going to go into school construction and teachers and so forth but we have to see if some of the postponement into 2010 are going to be reversed in this year. It\u2019s going to be important because some of the material is starting to get dated in some of these states.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from [Adrian De St. Helier] \u2013 Unidentified Company", "[Adrian De St. Helier] \u2013 Unidentified Company", "On the higher education can you give us some color on how you\u2019re expecting enrollments to grow in 2009? Some of your competitors have been guiding on a 10% organic increase would you follow that path?", "Terry McGraw", "It\u2019s kind of difficult to tell at this point. There\u2019s expectation that we\u2019ll have to sort of see as we get into the new semester enrollments. Obviously the higher education business is a counter cyclical business. In times of economic downturns and the like, more people go on this one and we\u2019re certainly seeing that. We\u2019re certainly seeing the activity at the community college level which is very important because obviously these are people that are affected by job loss or the need for job change and their looking for specific skill sets. We\u2019re definitely seeing increased enrollments.", "Overall I think that you can see over the next three, four years you\u2019re going to see enrollment increases in the United States probably up to the 18, 19 million levels.", "[Adrian De St. Helier] \u2013 Unidentified Company", "Coming back on BusinessWeek, you came some trend about advertising. Can you give us some trend regarding circulation?", "Terry McGraw", "That\u2019s good news. Circulation growth is up and we\u2019re very pleased on that because the readership is strong, circulation is growing. Obviously the problem is on the business model and the advertising side of it. We\u2019re doing everything we possibly can to distribute through multi-channels and to be able to get more access to that editorial base. Circulation is up.", "[Adrian De St. Helier] \u2013 Unidentified Company", "Concerning the controlling costs, you mentioned a couple of measures. Are you getting as well on staff reductions? What is the potential you see in offshoring?", "Terry McGraw", "For 2008 as you know through the restructuring we have cut back 1,045 positions in the company. At this point with some small staff reductions it\u2019s not material for the first quarter. Outsourcing things, we vendor all of our outsourcing relations and this is an additional way especially in the Education space to get cost savings and we\u2019re doing that in a variety of ways; China, the Philippines, India and so forth. We\u2019ll continue to find ways to be more efficient through that so it\u2019s a very important part but it\u2019s all vendored from that standpoint.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning\u2019s call.

(Operator Instructions).", "I would now like to introduce Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the McGraw-Hill Companies.", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you. Good morning to our worldwide audience. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning for the McGraw-Hill Companies second quarter earnings call. I'm Donald Rubin Senior Vice President, Investor Relations at the McGraw-Hill Companies. With me this morning are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO, and Robert Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, the company issued a news release with second quarter results. We trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of it, and financial schedules they could be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates, and descriptions of future events.

However, this call is for investors, so we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Mr. Steve Weiss in our New York office at area code 212-512-2247 subsequent to this call.", "Today's updates will last approximately an hour. After our presentation, the meeting will be open to questions. I am pleased now to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Terry McGraw", "Thank you for joining us this morning. Welcome to our review of the second quarter earnings and our outlook for the remainder of 2009. With me today, besides Don, is Bob Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will be starting off by reviewing our operating results and Bob will provide in depth outlook on our key financials. Of course, as Don said, after our presentation, we'll go in any direction that anybody would like to go with questions or comments.", "Earlier today, we reported our second quarter results. Earnings per diluted share were $0.52, and that included $0.06 for a net restructuring charge, which was $0.03 and a loss on a divestiture, which was also $0.03 for the earnings. Revenue in the second quarter decreased 12.4% to $1.5 billion.", "At this point in the year, we still see challenges in the school marketplace as state budget pressures persist, but there are also signs that the economic activity has begun to recover. An improving flow of credit is helping to lay the groundwork for recovery. In financial markets, spreads are narrowing and should continue to tighten. Money managers and insurance companies are putting more money to work, and there is renewed investor interest in the non-financial investment grade bonds and in even speculative grade instruments as well.", "In the second quarter, we took some important steps to prepare for the future. First, we took a $0.03 restructuring charge for a workforce reduction of approximately 550 positions, about 2.5% of the total workforce. A key step in this restructuring was the reduction of approximately 340 positions at McGraw-Hill Education, as we combined our supplemental and basal operations. I'll discuss this in a little more detail in a little bit.", "Secondly, we sold Vista Research, and that resulted in a pretax loss of $13.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Thirdly, we announced that we're exploring strategic options for BusinessWeek. The takeaway is clear. In preparing for the future, this Management team will continue to align resources with the company's strategic outlook and growth opportunities in the market.", "With that as background, let's take a look at our segments and how they performed and the prospects for the rest of the year and how we're looking at 2010, in each of these markets as well.", "For McGraw-Hill education, this year is a tale of two markets. First is the declining sales in the elementary/high school market and the second one is the sustained growth in the US college and university market. Both trends were evident in the segment's second quarter performance and undoubtedly will be factors in our second half results.", "For this segment in the second quarter, revenue declined 17.2%, reflecting a 22.7% falloff for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group and a 6.9% decline for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional and International Group. Including a net pretax restructuring charge of $11.6 million, operating profit declined by 70.1%. The operating margin was 3.8%.", "By now, everyone has probably heard about the challenges in this year's elementary/high school market. State budgets for education are under pressure. There are substantial cutbacks in historic buying levels in the adoption states. Federal stimulus funds are still trickling into the market, and with the sales opportunities shrinking this year in Florida and California, we are reducing our estimate for the 2009, state new adoption market to $500 million to $550 million.", "Our new estimate includes some modest benefits from the Federal stimulus funds that we have been able to identify. We had been originally forecasting $550 Million to $600 million. Federal stimulus funds are still the wild card in this year's market. Without the benefit of stimulus funds, we still expect the high and the EL/HI market to decline by 15% to 20% this year.", "We don't expect more state level postponements, but there could be additional school district postponements in economically stressed states like California. Although, the rate of purchasing is much lower than originally forecast, we expect to capture available business across a range of subjects.", "We should perform well in the following state new adoptions; reading in California and Louisiana, math in California, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Oregon, science in Tennessee, social studies in Indiana. We now estimate a capture rate of 30% of the total available dollars in the state new adoption market for this year.", "In testing, our formative assessment program, we call it Acuity, continues to win new adoptions and renewals, but these gains were offset by declines in custom and off-the-shelf products.", "The revenue outlook in higher education is very different. The US college and university market is off to a very strong start this year, and so are we. As a result, we're increasing our forecast for the market in 2009. We now expect the US college market to grow between 5% and 7%. Previously, we had forecasted growth of 3% to 4%. We have a solid new publications list for all four imprints, successful new digital offerings and the benefits of higher enrollments last fall and again this spring.", "There are indications that enrollments will grow again in this semester, and that starts in the fall. But because of the softness in the EL/HI market, we are reducing our revenue guidance for this segment. Previously we had a forecast of a decrease of 7% to 8% in 2009, we now expect the segment revenue in 2009 to decline by 8.5% to 9.5%.", "Under these circumstances, some are starting to question prospects for education in 2010. We expect the outlook for education to improve for several reasons. One, the comparisons will get easier. Another is that the benefits of our recent restructuring will be realized. We also expect to operate more efficiently and lower development costs. A growing line-up of digital products will produce more growth. Federal stimulus funds will make a difference. The state new adoption calendar improves in 2010 and there will be more students, enrollments are still growing.", "Let's look now at how these reasons are compelling to the market and let's look at them in a little bit more detail. The first one would be comparisons will get easier. Revenue for McGraw-Hill School Education Group is off by 20.1% for the first half, and while we expect the rate of decline to diminish in the second half, there's no doubt we will be cycling against easier comparisons in 2010.", "Second, we will begin to see the benefits of the restructuring of our elementary/high school business in the second half with more to be realized in 2010. We recently announced the combination of our basal and supplemental school operations in a new streamlined pre-K-2 organization. As a result, we took a net restructuring charge of $11.6 million for this segment as approximately 340 positions were eliminated.", "Third, lowering development costs and reducing time-to-market are key objectives for the new organization. By increasing our focus on growth barriers, such as intervention and college and career readiness, and by streamlining our product creation in four learning solution centers, we are improving our operating efficiencies and revenue potential.", "Fourth, the integration of content, technology and distribution offers significant opportunities for growth. We will be increasing digital in the school market in testing, in higher education and in the professional markets. To create the same digital environment in the elementary and secondary classroom that is emerging outside this school, we recently created the McGraw-Hill Education Center for digital innovation, and we did this out in Bothell, Washington. It is focused on developing digital platforms. It's why we could introduce cinch mathematics, an all-digital curriculum that combines online capabilities with the power of interactive whiteboards.", "In testing, we just introduced Acuity UnWired, a version of our formative assessment system that permits students to respond by using wireless handheld devices. By the way, Acuity recently won the prestigious CODiE award from the Educational Software Association for the \"Best Student Assessment System.\" Online study tools are rapidly gaining traction in the college and the university market as we find new ways to incorporate the printed page into our dynamic online learning environment.", "Fifth, the potential impact of the Federal stimulus package remains difficult to gauge at this time, but the Title I funds for schools serving disadvantaged students and the IDEA funds for special education programs could make a meaningful difference in some states and some product categories in the second half. There's a total of $25.2 billion available for Title I and IDEA Special Education funds in the system.", "Federal stimulus money is moving into the states, but with few exceptions it is moving very slowly into districts. As of July 24, 44 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have been approved for about $29 billion in funding. Six states have applications pending. It is widely expected that the first wave of stabilization funding would be used by state and districts to cover shortfalls and save teaching jobs in 2009 rather than to initiate new purchases.", "We expect to have a solid list of stimulus funded adoptions to report at the end of the third quarter. We also expect to see some fourth quarter sales activity as well. The administration's focus on real-time assessments and multiple measures combined with stimulus money and state and local interest and formative assessments will also provide new opportunities for Acuity. Undoubtedly, the stimulus package will have greater impact in 2010 than in 2009 on the elementary/high school market.", "Also, don't overlook the fact that Federal stimulus package contains several provisions with positive implications for post-secondary education. That includes increases in the maximum Pell Grant and increased support for work study programs.", "Sixth, we still expect to see an improved state new adoption calendar for next year. We currently estimate approximately $950 million to $1 billion for state new adoptions in 2010. The market should benefit from the increased availability of stimulus funds, the implementation of 2009 postponements in 2010 and the return of Texas to the market for K-12 reading, literature and that adoption. That program has already been funded by the Texas state legislature. The opportunity in Florida for K-12 math in 2010 also looks solid. The state needs new textbooks so that math can be taught according to the newly revised state standards.", "Seven, enrollments are growing across the entire pre-K to 16 student population. According to the latest projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, that's a very good website to monitor, there will be 56.4 million students enrolled in elementary and secondary institutions next year and 18.6 million in US higher education.", "So, summing up for the McGraw-Hill Education segment, before the benefits of the Federal stimulus package, 15% to 20% decline in the EL/HI market, 5% to 7% increase in the US college and university market, and for the segment in 2009, 8.5% to 9.5% decline in revenue, 300 to 400 basis point decline in the operating margin, and that's excluding the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges and implies an operating margin of 9% to 10%.", "Let's move to the McGraw-Hill Financial Services segment. In Financial Services, growth in the industrial sector here and abroad, another decline in structured finance and some softness in the index services were important factors in the second quarter performance. For the segment in the second quarter, revenue was off 8.4%, and that's reflecting a 9.9% decline at the S&P Credit Market Services, and a 4.9% decline at S&P Investment Services.", "Including a pre-tax loss of $13.8 million from the divestiture of Vista Research and a pre-tax net benefit of $400 million from restructuring charges, operating profit declined by 8.8%. The operating margin was 41%.", "Two things are not immediately apparent from these results. First, comparisons were especially challenging because the second quarter in 2008 was the biggest revenue and profit producer last year for Financial Services. Second, there were signs of a thaw in the credit markets in this year's second quarter.", "One of the keys to thawing the credit markets has been the ability of the banks in the second quarter to issue debt without government guarantees. In the first quarter, guaranteed debt accounted for more than 80% of the financial sector issuance. It has now fallen to less than 50%. As the capital base of banks improves, there is a renewed ability to attract capital from the private sector.", "Liquidity has also improved. One sign is the bank's decreasing demand for short-term funding from Federal programs. The sharp drop in LIBOR indicates that banks are more comfortable getting funds from each other. This is important, the spread between the three-month LIBOR and the Fed's overnight rate, a gauge of how banks assess the riskiness of lending to one another, is down to approximately 0.4%.", "There's a greater willingness of investors to take on some risks. That trend, undoubtedly, contributed to the 82.6% increase in US speculative grade issuance in the second quarter. Much of the issuance was used to reconnect bonds and loans. There remains a significant need for speculative grade companies to raise cash, especially those looking to shift debt from short-term loans into longer term maturities.", "We also saw an increase in dollar volume issuance in the industrial sector in the second quarter, and it was up 2.1% in the US and 34.8% in Europe. Issuance has risen because issuers turned to the public markets to avoid refinancing risks over the next 18 months. At the same time, low short-term interest rates and an aversion to equity and structured finance risk have channeled investors toward industrial bonds.", "Even though the structured finance market declined again in the United States and in Europe, the impact of the corporate activity on S&P's Credit Market Services transaction revenue was significant. In the second quarter, we saw 31.6% sequential increase in transaction revenue. Compared to the biggest quarter of 2008, transaction revenue was down year-over-year by 21.6%.", "The outlook for structured finance for the rest of the year remains uncertain. The US residential mortgage backed securities market has benefited in the short term from increased RE-REMIC issuance, but the longer term outlook for this market and the European residential mortgage-backed securities market is dependent upon a recovery in the housing market. The majority of the European structured finance transaction revenue continues to be derived from the government and central bank liquidity programs, in both. In both Europe and the United States the markets for the commercial mortgage-backed securities and the collateralized debt obligations continued to experience very little issuance and very low trading volume in the secondary markets.", "The TALF program has stimulated some new activity in the US asset-backed securities market, but year-over-year new issuance declined by 25.8% in the second quarter 2009. Since beginning of this year there's been a substantial tightening of spreads in three important consumer asset classes, certainly autos, credit cards and student loans. We anticipate further recovery in the asset-backed securities sector, important factor for '09, but also as we go into 2010.", "The new activity in the bond market is encouraging. A continuation of this trend will favorably impact transaction revenue in the second half as our year-over-year comparisons obviously get much easier. As a result, we are changing our forecast for transaction revenue for the year. We had expected a 10% to 12% decline in transaction revenue in 2009, we now expect a mid-single digit decline in transaction revenue for the year, a very encouraging and a very good sign.", "Non-transaction revenue was off 3.1% in the second quarter. The primary reason was a reduction in fees earned for work on canceled transaction or breakup fees, breakage fees, and the impact of foreign exchange. Non-transaction revenue is derived from annual contracts, surveillance fees and subscription services, and produced a 67.9% of Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services revenue in the second quarter. Unlike transaction revenue, non-transactions are resilient source of revenue. For the first half of 2009, non-transaction revenue represented 69.6% of S&P Credit Market Services' total revenue.", "We still expect only a slight decline for the year in non-transactional revenue, primarily, because less breakage fees in 2009 versus 2008, and again the impact of foreign exchange. International revenue at S&P Credit Market Services declined by $24 million in the second quarter, but $21 million of that decrease can be attributed to foreign exchange rates. Rates moved strongly in the second half of 2008, so they probably will be less of a factor in the upcoming 2009 comparisons.", "For the year, we continue to expect low single digit revenue decline in S&P Credit Market Services in 2009. The near term outlook is somewhat mixed for S&P Investment Services. Revenue declined 4.9% in the second quarter and we now expect a low single digit decrease for the year. The sale of Vista Research in May is a contributing factor. At the end of July, the settlement contracts with the investment banks expire for our equity research products.", "There are currently nine firms purchasing independent research from S&P. The good news is that we are going to retain some of these clients and we're negotiating with these firms and some will continue stock coverage and purchase other products as well. We've already signed a new agreement with Citibank and more are in the works.", "Index services experienced a decline in the second quarter, primarily driven by a reduction in asset-based fees from exchange traded funds, and a drop in over-the-counter derivatives trading, all linked to various S&P indices. Assets under management and exchange traded funds, based on S&P indices, fell by 8% to $189.8 billion at the end of the second quarter versus the same period last year. As a market rebound, we also saw a sequential improvement over the first quarter, which had ended at $158.6 billion. We did see an increased purchasing of our data and growth in the custom index business as well.", "11 new exchange traded funds based on S&P indices were launched in the second quarter. There are now a total of 209 exchange traded funds based on S&P indices. We have more indices in the pipeline to help our clients accumulate assets.", "Capital IQ continues to attract new clients, finishing the second quarter with more than 2,800 clients and increase of 5.2% since the end of 2008. Capital IQ is continuing to expand overseas and benefit from international growth in the second quarter.", "Let's spend now a few minutes on the regulatory outlook for credit rating agencies. In the United States, we're working with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the White House, the Treasury Department and the Congress on proposed new legislation. In Europe, we're working with CESR, those are the security regulators, the European Commission, IOSCO, as well as others. We will continue to work with IOSCO and are reaching out to regulators and policymakers in Japan, Australia and Canada. In short, we are touching all of the bases as we work for globally consistent oversight analytical independence and a level playing field for everyone.", "A lot has changed at Standard & Poor's, especially on the credit rating side. This is in the last two years. We are using all the means at our disposal to convey how our internal initiatives complement proposed new regulations, both here and abroad.", "We're focused on measures in four key areas, obviously, quality; secondly prevention of conflicts; three, increased transparency; and four accountability. We continue to work in all four areas and communicate our commitment to improvement to policymakers, legislators, regulators to help restore confidence in the credit markets.", "The latest effort in our global outreach was an ad on Standard & Poor's commitment to reform. It ran in The Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and others, and you can find the full text of that comment at www.standardandpoors.com, which addresses the changes S&P has made in its business in the last two years.", "\\", "The timeline on the new regulatory framework remains fluid. In the United States, we hope the legislative process will be completed by the end of the year, but depending on, obviously, Congressional priorities it may not be finished until sometime in 2010, but we really believe it's a 2009 action.", "In Europe, we expect the new European Union legislation on credit rating agencies to be formally adopted this fall. The effective date for rating agencies to be in compliance is expected to be by mid-2010, and we will be ahead of that in terms of initiatives.", "In this period, we will continue to deal with the issues as they arise. There is, for example, the misleading notion that S&P Credit Market Services has not changed its practice in light of recent market difficulty. It is not subject to meaningful regulatory oversight. The fact that S&P Credit Market Services is now a highly regulated business doesn't seem to get much recognition from these critics. The new regulations were originally described in the press as mostly \"innocuous.\" An observation that fails to appreciate the breadth and depth of the regulatory scheme under which we operate.", "The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 gave the SEC a significant amount of regulatory authority, and I can assure you that it is being exercised vigorously and on a regular basis. Earlier this year, new wide ranging SEC rules took effect.", "They include measures related to disclosure and management of potential conflicts related to the \"issuer-pay\" model, a ban an certain conduct involving gifts and fee discussions with analysts, increased record keeping requirements for material deviations, [a sign] for model outputs and complaints about analyst performance, just to name a few. More new rules will be coming, and that's according to the SEC. In short, it is quite clear that S&P Credit Market Services is, and I can assure you, will continue to be subject to robust regulatory oversight, and we will work with that.", "Accountability is another issue. In addition to our daily accountability to the market, which is the most important check on our rating business, we are accountable to the SEC and subject to private litigation. Like all other participants in the financial markets, we can be sued for securities fraud. While courts have recognized that ratings opinions are entitled to First Amendment protection against certain claims, it is important to state clearly that the First Amendment provides no exemption from potential liability for intentionally misleading or organize defrauding investors.", "That fundamental legal point seems to have alluded some of our critics. We have approximately three dozen lawsuits from plaintiffs and their counsels who clearly think they have stated causes of action against S&P notwithstanding the First Amendment.", "On the litigation front, the newest lawsuit was filed by Calpers and has gained a fair bit of attention. Calpers says it purchased without due diligence 1.3 billion of securities based solely on ratings opinions issued by S&P, Moody's and Fitch. That's notwithstanding our clear and long-standing public disclosure that a rating is not a recommendation to buy, to sell or hold. Some in the media have expressed surprise that a sophisticated institutional investor like Calpers would make such a significant investment decision like this without conducting its own firsthand analysis. We think the lawsuit is totally without merit and we intend to defend against it vigorously.", "Summing up then for the Financial Services for 2009, slight decline in revenue, margin decline at 225 to 275 basis points excluding 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges and the loss on Vista, low single digit growth and expenses implied operating margin of approximately 39%.", "Finally, now let's take a look at the Information and Media segment. The continuing weakness in the advertising market was a key factor in the performance of this segment. For the second quarter, revenue declined 11.5%, reflecting a 23.1% decrease at broadcasting and a 10.2% falloff in the business-to-business group. Including a pre-tax charge of $4 million, the operating profit declined by 41.8% and the operating margin was 6.1%.", "In broadcasting, we experienced declines in national and local time sales. Softness in auto advertising was clearly a contributor to this picture. The absence of political advertising after last year's strong performance is obviously a factor in 2009 in comparison to 2008. Print advertising is also soft across the board in the business-to-business group. That includes our publications in the construction and aviation markets, as well as BusinessWeek. Advertising pages in BusinessWeek's Global Edition were off 34.3% in the second quarter. That's according to the Publishers Information Bureau, PIB.", "During the second quarter, oil prices have more than doubled since hitting a low of $33.98 a barrel on February 12. That volatility also contributes to the strong performance of Platts, our global energy information service. Platts is growing in the petroleum, natural gas, nuclear and the metal markets.", "Summing up then for Information and Media, in lieu of continued weakness in advertising, we are reducing revenue guidance. We now expect a decline of 8% to 9%. Previously, the forecast called for a decrease of 5% to 6% and a 300% to 400% basis point decline in the operating margin, excluding the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges.", "Therefore, finally, summing up for the corporation, a revenue decline of 5.5% to 6.5% for the year, excluding the second quarter restructuring charge and the divestiture of Vista, our guidance for 2009 earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.25, although it appears that we will come in at the low end of the range on that one. I have to say that our prospects in the second half begin to appear much more promising, especially on the education front and in terms of some of the improvement on the Financial Service side. So we'll see as we go.", "That wraps up the review of the operations, especially for the second quarter, for the remainder of the year and as we are starting to look at 2010. Let's hear now from Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer, on the financial results.", "Bob Bahash", "The key to the year is our second half performance, so I want to focus this morning on factors that will influence results during this crucial period. The obvious one, of course, is the seasonality of our education business, which makes the third quarter the biggest earnings contributor each year. There are other influences that will be important as well.", "If you do the math on our full year revenue guidance, and I'm sure you will, it will be apparent that we expect the rate of decline we saw in our revenue in the first half it was up 9.6% to diminish in the second half. This is also true for expenses. In the first half, they're down 7.1%. For the full year, excluding restructuring charges in 2008 and 2009 and the loss on the divestiture of Vista in 2009, we expect consolidated expenses to decline in the low single digit range, implying minimal growth and expenses in the second half.", "Now, let's review some other factors that influenced the first half performances and our expectations for the second half, including restructuring, the impact of foreign exchange on revenue and expense and incentive compensation. In doing so, I hope three things become clear.", "First, we've been able to mitigate the revenue decline in the first half through stringent expense controls, and we are not going to let up in the second half. Second, the company's financial position is strong and will remain so. Third, the actions we've taken leave us well positioned when economic conditions improve.", "In the second quarter, we took a restructuring charge of $24.3 million relating to the reduction of approximately 550 positions. This is partially offset by a reverse reversal of $9.1 million related to prior restructuring initiative, resulting in a net charge of $15.2 million pre-tax or approximately $0.03 per diluted share of second quarter earnings, the majority of the restructuring charge related to our decision to combine our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations. Due to the timing of the actions as well as the implementation costs, the cost of benefit of this combination will largely be realized in 2010.", "The reversal of $9.1 million related to prior restructuring initiatives is primarily due to two factors; one, instances where we eliminated the position but were able to place affected employees in open positions within some of our faster growing businesses; and two, lower than anticipated severance payments. This was most pronounced at some of our international locations. Country rules vary significantly making estimating international severance a little challenging. Our estimates turned out to be conservative.", "Foreign exchange will be a factor in our results for the year. In the first and second quarters, foreign exchange significantly reduced revenue. It reduced second quarter revenue by $37.2 million, increasing the revenue decline by 220 basis points. In the first half, foreign exchange reduced revenue by $74.6 million, increasing the revenue decline here by 260 basis points. Based on current rates, we anticipate the impact on revenue to lessen in the second half.", "Foreign exchange reduced segment expenses by $32.4 million in the second quarter and by $82 million in the first half. Excluding restructuring charges in 2008 and 2009 and the loss on the divestiture of Vista, segment expenses would have declined 7.6% in the second quarter at constant currencies versus the reported 10.1% decline. Year-to-date expenses would have declined 3.8% versus the reported 7.4% decline. Based on current rates, we expect the impact on foreign exchange on expenses to lessen in the second half.", "In the first half, the impact to operating profit from foreign exchange was a benefit of $7.3 million. These different top and bottom-line outcomes occurred because we primarily bill in euros and US dollars, while significant expenses are denominated in currencies such as the British pound, which has significantly weakened compared to the US dollar.", "Changing levels of incentive compensation were a factor in the first half and will be even more significant in the second half. In the second quarter, we benefited from a $23 million decline in incentive compensation for the segments as well as corporate. For the first half, the benefit was approximately $29 million.", "In our yearend call, I indicated that we expected full year incentive compensation to increase $110 million. We refined our estimates taking into account current projections as well as the impact of restructuring actions. We now believe that the full year increase will be approximately $90 million. That implies $119 million increase in incentive compensation in the second half, because we reduced our long-term and short-term accruals in the second half of the 2008 particularly in the third quarter. As a result, we had negative stock-based compensation of $39 million in the third quarter of 2008.", "Our cost containment initiative should enable us to reduce expenses in two of our three segments even as revenue declines. At McGraw-Hill Education, as Terry indicated, we now expect revenue to decline 8.5% to 9.5% versus the previous guidance of 7% to 8% decrease. We also anticipate a mid single digit decline in expenses versus our previous estimate of a low single digit decline. On that basis, we are maintaining our margin guidance of 300 to 400 basis point decline, excluding the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges.", "Expenses were down 11.7% year-over-year in the second quarter and 10% in the first half, excluding the restructuring actions in both years. At constant currencies, first half expenses were down 7.1%, benefiting from prior restructuring actions, lower costs of goods sold given the lower revenue, and lower sales and marketing costs, which, in some cases, will shift to the third quarter of 2009.", "In the Financial Services segment, credit market services transaction revenue is down 20% in the first half, but we expect strong growth in the second half as comparisons, particularly in the fourth quarter, gets significantly easier due to the depressed issuance in 2008. Credit market services non-transaction revenue increased from $280 million in the first quarter to $311 million in the second quarter. Part of the reason for this sequential increase is the fact that the first quarter was depressed due to the timing of renewals for certain contracts.", "Due to tight expense controls, we now expect margins for the segment to decline 225 to 275 basis points versus our previous margin guidance of 250 to 300 basis points decline. This implies a low single digit increase in expenses and a modest improvement from our previous guidance. For the second quarter, expenses were down 8%, excluding restructuring charges in 2008 and 2009 and the loss on the Vista divestiture. Adjusting for currency, expenses were down $15.2 million or 3.6%. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced incentive compensation and restructuring benefits from previous actions, and we also benefited from the divestitures of Vista and CRISIL's Gas Strategies Group.", "For the first half, expenses were down 4.4%. At constant currencies, they were up 1.3%. Second half comparisons are more difficult, given increased incentive compensation and reduced impact of foreign exchange. Partially offsetting these are the benefits of previous restructuring actions.", "In Information and Media, Compass, an online reporting and analytical tool recently introduced by JD Power, is having a significant impact on segment revenue and profits. As I've indicated previously, the segment's results for the year will be adversely affected by the non-cash accounting impact of converting studies on to this online platform. Revenue previously recognized at the time of syndicated studies release will not be recognized ratably over the 12-month life of the subscription. This is similar to the Sweets transition in 2006.", "For the full year, we now expect a $12 million decrease in revenue and a $7 million decrease in profit due to the impact of Compass versus our previous guidance of a $15 million decline in revenue and a $10 million decline in profit. The revised estimate is due to changes in scope and timing of conversions. For the second quarter, the Compass conversion resulted in $3.4 million decrease in revenue and a $2.9 million decrease in profit. For the first half, the figures would be an $8.1 million decrease in revenue and $5.2 million in profits.", "Due to the additional revenue decline we are projecting for the segment, partially mitigated by continued cost containment initiatives, we now are forecasting a 300 to 400 basis point decline in margins, excluding the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges versus our previous forecast of a 200 to 300 basis point decline. This essentially implies a mid single digit decline in expenses for the year versus our previous guidance of a low single digit decline.", "Corporate expenses in the second quarter were $29.3 million, a $4.2 million dollar decline from the same period last year, largely due to reduced stock-based compensation. Second half comparisons, particularly in the third quarter, becomes significantly more challenging reflecting the increases in stock-based and short-term incentive compensation that I previously mentioned. We continue to expect that corporate expenses will increase this year by $25 million to $30 million due to the increased incentive compensation.", "The company's effective tax rate was 36.4% in the second quarter versus 37% in the same period last year. We expect the full year 2009 tax rate to be 36.4%, an approximate 60 basis point decline from 2008.", "Let's now review free cash flow. To calculate free cash flow, we start with after-tax cash from operations and deduct investments and dividends as well as working capital. What's left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt. Our free cash flow guidance previously did not reflect any pension plan contributions, although we indicated that there could be a contribution in the second half. Based on current expectations, we plan to make a pension contribution of approximately $25 million in the third quarter. We have now incorporated this into our free cash flow projections.", "Now, even with the pension contribution, we continue to expect free cash flow for the year to be in the range of $430 million to $450 million. Now, that's the guidance that we had previously given, although most likely at the low end of the range. This is approximately equal to last year despite lower profits due to continuing working capital improvements and our focus on cost containment and prudent investments.", "In the first half of 2009, free cash flow improved by $337 million versus the prior year. In the first half, free cash flow is generally negative due to the seasonality of our businesses. As we had anticipated, it was substantially higher than the previous year, driven by a significant reduction in cash incentive compensation payments and continuing working capital improvements, particularly for inventories and accounts receivable. Second half comparisons will be more difficult given lower anticipated receipts.", "The corporation's financial position remains strong. Net debt decreased to $731 million, down $130 million versus the first quarter and $65 million versus yearend. We continue to have access to commercial paper market at very low rates.", "On a gross basis, total debt at the end of the quarter was $1.3 billion. It is comprised of $1.2 billion in unsecured senior notes as well as about $90 million in commercial paper. This is offset by $556 million in cash, primarily foreign holdings. The first long-term debt payment is not due until the end of 2012. So we are in a comfortable position in terms of managing maturities.", "Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $313 million in the second quarter, an 8.1 million share decline versus the same period last year. That's roughly flat compared to the first quarter 2009. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to the 2008 share repurchases and to a lesser extent the decline in our stock price. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately $313 million.", "Interest expense was $18.5 million in the second quarter, a $2 million decline from the prior year. For the full year, we expect interest expense to be roughly comparable with 2008.", "In today's challenging environment, we are continuing to manage investments prudently without hurting the enterprise. New efficiencies and softening market conditions will result in more reductions this year in prepublication costs and a cutback in the purchase of property and equipment. Prepublications and investments were $42.3 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $23 million compared to the second quarter of 2008.", "For the year, we now expect prepub and investments of approximately $200 million, which is down from our previous guidance of $225 million and $254 million that we invested last year. Prepub costs are being reduced because in the current economic environment the scope of some programs is being reduced. There is a change in the timing of some programs and we continue to realize benefits of offshoring and other efficiencies.", "Purchases of property and equipment were $9 million in the second quarter compared to $25 million in the same period last year, reflecting year-over-year reductions in technology spend and real estate improvements. We now anticipate full year expenditures of approximately $75 million to $80 million versus our previous estimate of $90 million.", "Now, let's review our non-cash items. Amortization of prepub costs in the second quarter was $71 million versus $66 million in the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect prepub amortization of $275 million to $280 million versus $270 million in 2008. Depreciation was $28.8 million in the second quarter. That's $1.6 million lower than the same period last year, and we're still forecasting approximately $130 million for the full year.", "Amortization of intangibles was $11.4 million for the quarter versus $13 million for the same period last year. And for the full year, we expect approximately $50 million versus our previous estimate of $55 million.", "I'll conclude with a comment on our growth in unearned revenue, which ended the second quarter of 2009 at $1.1 billion. It's roughly flat with the prior year and the first quarter, but in constant currencies it grew 2.6% versus the prior year. At the end of the second quarter, Financial Services represented approximately 75% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. We still expect unearned revenue to grow slightly in 2009.", "Terry McGraw", "Before I turn it back to Don, overall, we're encouraged by some of the improvement in the conditions during the second quarter and certainly we're encouraged by the earnings results, given the performance in June. As I said at the end of the first quarter earnings call, we really saw at that point the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of this year as being the bottom in the market and we really feel substantiated on that. We've started to see an improvement in conditions in the second quarter leading us to believe that the second half is going to be a lot better, obviously, than the first half on that one.", "There's an awful lot going on in our various markets that we can take advantage of. As we return from an economic standpoint to a healthier situation, we're in a very, very good position to take advantage of some of those opportunities. We talked about some of them and we can talk about them in any questions or comments that you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The first question comes from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray", "Terry, based on the AAP data it does look like you're losing relatively significant market share in the K-12 business. Can you comment on that, in terms of specific areas where you think that might be occurring and why that might imply that you might continue to see challenging revenue trends next year as well?", "Terry McGraw", "As we were saying in the remarks, the K-12 market is obviously under a lot of pressure, and it is really dependent right now on stimulus money coming into the market. It has been extremely slow, as we try and monitor where that stimulus money is. There are some issues coming out of the Federal government with it. There are also some issues in terms of state administration of those kinds of funds, getting the funds to the district. Also, we're seeing some of the pullback and postponements in terms of some of the adoption areas. So at this point it's a timing issue.", "We're taking advantage of some of the Title 1 and some of the IDEA special education funds, and we think that in the second half of this year that we're going to be able to pick up some at that pace. So I don't look at it as losing share or those kinds of things. Right now it is a very fluid situation. It's a timing issue. I think that we're going to finish up a little bit better than where we are projecting, but I think it's safe to say that until we see more stimulus money into the marketplace, that the 15% to 20% decline that we've talked about is a very prudent place to be, and we hope to do better than that.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray", "Then second question, I am wondering how you're feeling about just the strategic appeal of the whole Information & Media segment in terms of what clearly has been operating results have weighed on your performance for the last several years and exacerbated this year by the challenges in the ad business, which don't look like they're going to be getting any better. So you've made a step with the decision to divest BusinessWeek, it doesn't make sense to go further than that within that Information & Media segment?", "Terry McGraw", "It's not fair to comment more broadly on that, other than to say what I've said all along is that, in conditions like this, in particular, everything in the portfolio gets scrutinized. We're looking for future growth paths and the like and the extent to which we see limitations on it we're going to deal with it. Therefore, that's why I made the comment that we're exploring these strategic options, but obviously anything in the portfolio in terms of growth implication is also being scrutinized as well.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Last thing, Terry, in terms of the litigation, you're not make any reserves, correct, in terms of possible settlements?", "Terry McGraw", "No. I don't want to comment on that part, Peter. I would say, though, that in terms of the legal suits, and as you know, we've got them categorized essentially in three buckets, there's a whole group in what we call the underwriting suits that says S&P was an underwriter of securities, which is absolutely false. We're not. We've gotten good defenses on that one.", "The second one is a category of stock drop suits. That the stock dropped, because we failed to say something, or tell, or inform the market, or something and that's just not the case, and we'll defend those. The third is in the state and municipality area, where some think ratings are too low, and therefore, their interest payments are too high. We'll defend those as well. So in every case we're eager to get to briefs, because as soon as you get through briefs then we can go for early dismissal, and we expect to see some movement fairly soon on the early release of some of these. I think that will quell that situation a little bit.", "We've got to get through that process. I mean, to say that we've a litigious society is an understatement. There are so much suits out there, not ours, but so many out there, getting before a judge is one, and then getting a judgment is a second one. So we're hoping that we're getting close to getting some early dismissal judgments", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Meltz of JPMorgan.", "Michael Meltz - JPMorgan", "I think I have three questions. First off, at S&P, can you give us update on the search there for new head of S&P ratings? Just walk us through exactly what you're doing in the timeline, and Terry, I think the last time around it took about two years to fill the spot, what's the expected timeline? Then I have two follow-ups.", "Terry McGraw", "Obviously, in any kind of situation, but especially now, when things are a little bit more difficult, everything, as I was saying to Peter, comes under review. We constantly are looking at our leadership and our talent management and constantly trying to figure out how we train, develop, nurture or replace and all of that. And so nothing's new. That's what we're doing. With Vickie Tillman taking on the new position for sustainability, which is a neat opportunity and a revenue generating opportunity for us, it gives us an opportunity to examine the leadership structure there.", "By the way, as you know, there's a lot of talent in the universe right now, and therefore, we are looking at that. I think that without putting undue expectation out there, I think that we've got a more immediate situation on that one. We feel very comfortable, very good. And I would also add on the talent leadership coming out of Europe, very strong. And so, we've taken this opportunity to upgrade in some areas, and we will continue to do that. That's a management thing.", "Michael Meltz - JPMorgan", "Within education, can you talk a little about the HPI segment? You're talking about college being very strong. You were down, I think, 2% to 3% in the quarter excluding currency. How bad is retail? How bad is international ex-currency? For the year, if I back into your guidance for segment growth, are you saying HPI total segment up modestly, is that what it implies?", "Terry McGraw", "Well, we said, Michael, that the growth for this year, we're upgrading from the 3% to 4% that we said to 5% to 7%, and we're certainly going to match that. We will see as we get through the all-important third quarter what upside to that there may be, but I think saying that at the very least we're going to match the 5% to 7% is where we ought to be. There's timing issues here obviously in the market. Some discount programs from competitors have inflated maybe some results in June. We'll see on a by the end of the third quarter where from a marketplace this all wrests out. We're very encouraged. Of course, as you know, the higher education, in particular, is a countercyclical business, and given the downturn, enrollments are way up and doing well. So we're very encouraged about this whole area.", "Internationally they're influenced as well in terms of the economic downturn, but it's countercyclical that way and we fully expect that to continue as you say ex-foreign currency to perform well. So we're very encouraged about this area.", "Michael Meltz - JPMorgan", "My question, though, Bob, I don't know if you have the data, does your guidance for the year imply that HPI Group in total up modestly, is that the guidance?", "Bob Bahash", "", "Let me just give a little bit further color to Terry's answer here. Clearly, the US higher education business is growing strongly, and we expect it to do very well for the balance of the year. The professional publishing piece, I'm not breaking out specific pieces, but it's the smallest of the three. We're looking at the US higher education, professional publishing and international. Professional, it's the smallest of the total, but clearly, the retail chains have been hit very, very hard, so their performance here is down pretty dramatically.", "On the international side, excluding currency, we're influenced somewhat by a decision that we made last year to discontinue certain K-12 operations in one of our particular markets. So we had revenue from that particular business last year which we don't have this year, which is influencing it. I think the second half on average is going to be about flat to up modestly, ex-currency.", "Michael Meltz - JPMorgan", "Okay. Then on S&P Investment Services, can you talk a little bit more about what exactly your expectations are for that business going forward? I think it was the second quarter it's disappointed relative to your expectations, and what exactly are you seeing there? I don't think you gave specific guidance for the year. I think if I back into your numbers, you're saying down modestly is that correct?", "Terry McGraw", "Yes. I think that's probably going to be the result there, Michael. I'm not discouraged on Investment Services at all. In fact, it's just the opposite. It's representing about 40% of the revenues now of S&P. It has got an absolutely super management team, and we've got terrific prospects here. I think the comparisons compared to last year are little difficult, but the Index Service is extremely strong, it defines a high margin business, Capital IQ and Compustat continue to gain client attraction. There are over 2,800 clients there and still growing.", "Compared to other trading platform, where you are seeing decline, we're growing there. Equity research is going to have a little bit of an issue given the curtailment of the settlement dollars, but we're working very hard, as we said, on retaining those customers that we have, and I have good promise on that. So in terms of data information, the analytics, the Capital IQ, the Index Services, no, no, very strong, and I think that we might surprise in the second half. I don't know on this thing. So slightly down, I think, would be a good forecast for now.", "Bob Bahash", "Michael, our guidance here specifically is a low single-digit decline. Just the points that Terry made are appropriate here. Index Services, we're seeing some pressure. We're seeing movement out of the large cap stocks into some of the smaller mid-cap stocks, not fully offsetting some of the movements out, as well, actually, impacting the overall market decline and what that does to your assets under management. Also, we're influenced in the second half of the year by the loss of the revenue from Vista and CRISIL's Gas Strategies Group, which is part of the Investment Services segment. Not big, but it does influence the growth.", "Terry McGraw", "Also, Michael, even with all that's going on in the comparisons to the second quarter of last year, we did launch 11 new exchange-traded funds in the quarter and we are very pleased with that and you are going to see the continuation of that pipeline.", "Michael Meltz - JPMorgan", "On the lawsuits, Terry, you mentioned here, and was mentioned in The Times, of the 35, 36 lawsuits, can you just, in kind of laymen's terms say how many of those, do you think, are, I guess, I would classify as real lawsuits versus stock drop lawsuits versus mortgage pass-through co-defendant type of lawsuits?", "Terry McGraw", "Michael, in the three categories that I gave you, we've sort of lumped them together as underwriter suits, stock drop suits and then state and municipalities. Obviously, there's quite a few in the stock drop area, and once those start to get dismissed and go, I think it's sort of like pulling the plug on a number of them., but we are going to be very aggressive. Now, I've told people that, well, especially on the legal risk, that I have it in my own mind as relatively low in all of that. It's your opinion, and whatever, but once we start getting the early releases from these and I think a lot of the pressure in terms of thinking about them goes away.", "Operator", "We'll go to the next question from Edward Atorino of Benchmark?", "Edward Atorino - Benchmark", "Hi. Good morning. I was sort of asking the same kind of questions Peter asked, so I'll pass.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Craig Huber of Barclays Capital.", "Craig Huber - Barclays Capital", "Few questions, let's take them one at a time if I could. Could you talk briefly about potential regulatory change outside of US and outside of Europe, has anything dramatically changed on the regulatory front outside of those two areas?", "Terry McGraw", "I think it's a very encouraging, picture. We were very pleased coming out of the G-20 in London that they agreed upon a regulatory format within the financial markets, but also, with respect to credit rating agencies. That was very appropriate and one that we can work with. I think that the issue here is, we have to see globally consistent regulation, because to your point, when you get beyond Europe, you get into the Asian markets, you get into the Middle East, as capital markets continue to grow and flourish, you're going to have to have regulatory schemes, and you can't keep coming up with all these individual schemes and therefore, there has to be some sort of framework in terms of this.", "I think what is going to come out of this, between the United States and Europe is going to be a very consistent picture, which others are going to be able to adopt to. That's important, because there's no global body, if you will, to arbitrate these. Coming now out of G-20, and we have a G-20 coming up in Pittsburgh in September, which will be important as well, I think it is very important not just in this area, but in other areas as well that there is consistency across the board on that front. So I see it as an encouraging development.", "Europe is essentially not implemented, but complete, and I think that by the end of this year, we probably should be complete here in the United States, and of course, the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee are weighing in. We've seen the administration's whitepaper on this one. I think that there's a lot of discussion going on, and once we get through the August recess, I think we will get it completed this year. That will be a good thing. Globally consistent regulation is what we've got to search for.", "Craig Huber - Barclays Capital", "Then totally separate question. How many analysts do you have in your S&P ratings business and the second part of that question, when new issuance does pick up on a sustained basis, do your folks or your analysts have enough bandwidth to absorb a significant higher issuance levels if your ratings work, do they have enough bandwidth or do you have to work and hire a ton of people here, what do you think?", "Terry McGraw", "We roughly have at this point about 1,200 analysts, and it might be a little bit higher than that, and I'm thinking fast here on the European and Middle East front. I'd say about 1,200 on that one. As things pick up, yes, you will see a modest pickup in some of that analyst activity. What we have done is we've cross-trained a lot of our analysts in areas so that if there's a little bit of fungibility here we can move people over to areas that are showing a little bit more strength.", "The corporates and governments area are doing quite well and some of the structured analysts back there on the residential and CDO issuance area have been moved over to some of those areas. So we've been able to protect a fair bit of our talent, albeit, we've had to cut back in certain areas, because of the conditions. So there will be a modest pickup in that, but for the most part, our strongest talent I think has been protected and we'll be fine going forward.", "Craig Huber - Barclays Capital", "In your outlook here for S&P ratings, what specifically is your personal outlook for your asset-backed issuance revenues for the full year, and a very important category, what's your outlook there for percent change?", "Terry McGraw", "I mean it's a fluid situation. Obviously, when people talk about structured finance and they talk about how is it going to come back and all of those kind of things, clearly, we hadn't expected in the first quarter to see some asset-backed deals, and it continued with some strength in the second quarter. So, both on credit card receivables and student loans, but also a little bit of pickup on the auto side. I'm sort of guessing. I think that we are going to see continued buildup on that side, and it's more of the plain vanilla structured finance instrumentation that you would expect to see coming back. It's a little bit of a fluid situation at this point, but mine is that I've been pleasantly surprised to see what we have, and if that continues into the third quarter that if going to have a nice influence for the structured market going forward.", "On the residential and commercial mortgage-backed side, Craig, as you know it's very soft. There is no movement there. And we're going to need to see, as we were saying in the remarks, the housing recovery, which we expect, home prices to bottom out by the end of this year and maybe into next year, but I think by the end of this year and that could have a nice influence on those markets. So it's still a very fluid situation, but of the activity that exists, to your point, asset-backed is showing a little bit of movement.", "Craig Huber - Barclays Capital", "Non-transaction revenues in the second quarter, as you mentioned, was up roughly 10% for the first quarter, was that partly because of the currency swing, but also because of these annual contracts that got signed in the second quarter and weren't in the numbers for the first quarter or that's not the reason still?", "Terry McGraw", "Yes. That's exactly right. As you would expect, I mean, the quarter-over-quarter non-transaction revenue is off a little bit because of the strength that it had in the first half of last year, but non-transaction revenue is still quite strong as surveillance fees in a sense continue.", "Bob Bahash", "And the timing of some of the annual contracts also influenced the difference between the first quarter and second quarter.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. That concludes this morning's call. The presentation slides will be available now for downloading from mcgraw-hill.com, and a replay of this call will be available in about two hours.

I would now like to introduce Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the McGraw-Hill Companies.", "Donald Rubin", "Good morning to our worldwide audience that has joined us this morning for the McGraw-Hill Companies Third Quarter Earnings Call. I\u2019m Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at the McGraw-Hill Companies. With me this morning are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO, and Robert Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning we issued a news release with our third quarter results. We trust you\u2019ve all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.McGraw-Hill.com. Before we begin I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward looking statements.", "Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements.", "In this regard we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other periodic reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call, however this call is for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Mr. Steve Weiss in our New York office at 212-512-2247 subsequent to this call.", "Today's update will last approximately an hour. After our presentation we will open the meeting to questions. It is now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Terry McGraw", "Welcome to our review of the third quarter earnings and the outlook for the remainder of the year. As Don mentioned, with me today is Bob Bahash our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll start today by reviewing the operating results and then Bob will provide an in depth look at some of our key financials. After our presentations obviously we\u2019ll be pleased to answer any questions or take any comments that you may have about the McGraw-Hill Company. With that let\u2019s get started.", "Earlier today we reported third quarter results. Earnings per diluted share were $1.07, revenue in the third quarter decreased by 8.4%. We also raised earnings guidance for the year, we now expect to achieve the top end of our $2.20 to $2.25 earnings per share guidance. At the end of the second quarter we had anticipated coming in at the lower end of that range. The new earnings per share guidance excludes second quarter restructuring charge of $0.03, a $0.03 loss on the divestiture of Vista Research in May and a projected $0.02 gain on the sale of BusinessWeek which will close in the fourth quarter.", "As I\u2019ve said before, in this environment management is reviewing, obviously, everything within the portfolio and that obviously included evaluating strategic options for BusinessWeek. BusinessWeek in its 80 years with McGraw-Hill Companies has made significant contributions to this company. We must focus on resources on areas with the greatest opportunities for growth and that means building size and scale globally in essential markets and expanding our digital capabilities. In reaching an agreement with Bloomberg we believe that BusinessWeek will continue to operate within an organization that shares the same high standards for editorial independence, integrity and excellence that are the hallmarks of this publication.", "In looking ahead, we\u2019re encouraged by recent reports that suggest an improving economic picture. Although the recovery is still expected to be sluggish our economists forecast GDP growth of 1.8% next year after a decline of 2.7% in 2009 and that shows GDP growth in the third and the fourth quarter. Stimulus spending is helping the economy but it appears that the funds are being spent more slowly then expected. That certainly seems to be the case this year in education but we are also seeing some positive indications that Federal Reserve and Treasury programs are contributing to improvement in the credit markets.", "Let\u2019s start our review of operations and let\u2019s begin with an outlook for the Financial Services segment. Our expectations for a pick up in the second half of this year at Financial Services started to take shape in the third quarter; improving market conditions, tighter spreads, and a surge in global debt issuance are evident in our results. For the first time in two years year over year quarterly revenue increased at Standard & Poor\u2019s credit market services. The modest increase, 0.7%, reflects a 6.5% gain in transaction revenue despite continuing softness in the structured finance market.", "Revenue at S&P Investment Services, which account for about one third of the segments top line declined by 7.6%. For the Financial Services segment in the third quarter revenue declined by 2.2%, operating profit decreased by 10.1% and the operating margin was 40.2%.", "The results, again underscore the position S&P Credit Market Services established in global markets. With total new issuance in the third quarter growing faster in Europe which was up 39.2% than in the United States which was up 31.4%, international revenue increased 3.3% in the third quarter or $6.7 million despite a $7.7 million hit by foreign exchange. Foreign source revenue accounted for 49.1% of S&P Credit Market Services revenue in the third quarter.", "Growth in the United States and European corporate industrial debt issuance was a key factor in these results. In the United States new issued dollar bond of industrials increased by 98.9% in the third quarter, in Europe the growth was 120.1% for this same period. S&P Credit Market Services also benefited from a 491.3% increase in high yield issuance and obviously off a low base in the United States in the third quarter. Speculative grade issuance was up 226.2% in Europe.", "In debt markets the spread or the excess interest rate over treasury bonds is a key gating factor for issuance. As this table shows spreads for investment and speculative grade bonds have narrowed significantly since the beginning of the year. The composite spread for investment grade at the beginning of this year was 531 basis points, by last week it was 226 basis points. The composite spread for speculative grade bonds was 1,628 basis points last January and by last week it was 693 basis points. Spreads for investment and high yield issues are still above their five year moving average and may remain elevated for some time as investors and the credit market tread cautiously through the current economic environment.", "Signs of progress are unmistakable. Improving credit market conditions enabled many companies to raise cash to fund operations or to refinance current or future maturing debt. The third quarter global volume for high yield bonds was the highest and more than a decade. Speculative grade companies with lower credit ratings were able to raise billions of dollars as risk premiums fell dramatically from the record levels in late 2008.", "An aversion to equity and structured finance risk has increased investor appetite for investment grade industrial bonds. Combined with industrial company\u2019s effort to avoid refinancing risk over the next 18 months and the lack of new money from the bank market, new issuance has taken off. Investors have also become more comfortable buying lower rated investment grade bonds, 54% of corporate issuance in this category has been low BBB, that\u2019s up from 28% earlier in the year.", "Financial institutions are continuing to de-leverage balance sheets and shrink liabilities. As expected, those balance sheet constraints have reduced growth in the corporate lending by the banks but banks are becoming more comfortable in obtaining funds from each other. They key gauge of how banks assess the riskiness of lending to one another is the spread between Libor and the Feds overnight rate. Recently the spread between the three month Libor and the Feds overnight rate fell to 0.34% which is near a pre-2007 level.", "Federal actions have clearly helped the financial sector. As the slide shows, the Federal programs are wide ranging. In the midst of the decline this year in the structured finance market the asset backed securities market benefited from the TALF (Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility). The program stimulated issuance in a wide array of ABS asset classes including credit cards, auto loans, auto leases, and student loans. As volume picked up and spreads began to normalize, traditional real money investors have returned to the market and the use of TALF leverage has decline sharply.", "The Fed continues to operate two short term funding facilities to help stabilize the commercial paper market and the money markets which invest heavily in asset backed commercial paper. The Fed has extended these programs to February of 2010. The US Treasury is preparing to implement the PPIP (Public Private Investment Partnership) which is designed to increase demand for existing legacy residential mortgage backed securities as well as commercial mortgage backed securities. ", "In the third quarter the European Central Bank began to purchase Euro denominated covered bonds to stimulate the residential mortgage backed securities market there. In short, there are positive signs for S&P Credit Market Services as we head into the fourth quarter. Clearly comparisons will be the easiest of the year. In the fourth quarter 2008 revenue fell 24.5%, the steepest decline of the year. ", "In the corporate market, a combination of tight spreads, a healthy refinancing calendar, low rates, and investor demand for yield should be positive for new issuance. In the municipal market the third quarter is historically slow but state and local governments should be active in the fourth quarter as the economic slow down increases the need for deficit borrowing.", "Federal stimulus plans including the Build American Bonds which initially got off to a very slow start, should be a positive in this market for the fourth quarter. In the asset backed securities market we have seen the benefits of the TALF program. Spreads remain tight and the deal flow looks positive. In the US mortgage backed securities market activity will remain light, particularly for the commercial mortgage backed securities. In the US, residential mortgage backed securities market re-securitization of existing securities enhanced with additional credit support, the Re-Remics are the main source of rating activity here.", "While the structured finance market continues to be challenged the momentum in corporate issuance is expected to help produce a double digit increase in transaction revenue at S&P Credit Market Services in the fourth quarter.", "Given the slow start to the year we expect transaction revenue for the full year to show a low single digit decline. Non-transaction revenue at S&P Credit Market Services slipped by 1.6% or $4.9 million in the third quarter. A reduction in breakage fees and the impact of foreign exchange were the primary reasons for the decline. This remains a durable revenue stream and should finish the year with only a slight decline. Again, the primary reasons for the decline will be the reduction in breakage fees and foreign exchange.", "Revenue declined at S&P Investment Services by 7.6% in the third quarter and that reflects the divestitures of Vista Research and CRISIL\u2019s in India, CRISIL\u2019s Gas Strategy Group. The expiration of the independent research settlement with the banks at the end of July and some softness in index products and services. If you exclude those divestitures the decline would be 4.4%. A mitigating factor is the continued growth of Capital IQ products and services despite bank consolidations, downsizes, and closures on Wall Street. Capital IQ has increased its customer base this year by 7.5% to more than 2,800 customers.", "A reduction in trading volume of over the counter and exchanged traded derivatives based on S&P indices is a major reason for the softness in index products and services. We are encouraged by the rebound in assets under management in exchange traded funds based on S&P indices. As this chart illustrates, assets under management have increased sequentially since the first quarter and are now more then $17 billion higher then the year end 2008 closing figure.", "We continue to be active in this market. Five new exchange traded funds using S&P indices were launched in the third quarter. There are now 214 exchange traded funds using S&P indices, that\u2019s up from 189 at the end of the third quarter in 2008 and many, many more are in the pipeline.", "Following the expiration of contracts for independent equity research at the end of July S&P signed contracts with Citibank and Morgan Stanley for continuation of stock coverage. New post-settlement business will be coming from Merrill Lynch which recently signed a contract to integrate our stock reports into research portals for their advisors and their clients. ", "No review of the Financial Services is obviously complete these days without comments on the regulatory and on the legal outlook. S&P Credit Market Services is complying with new regulations, new rules, and new laws. In the United States new rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission became effective in April and in August. ", "In September the SEC approved additional rules requiring more disclosure of rating histories and information underlying structured finance transactions and approved amendments to eliminate references to NRSRO ratings in certain rules and in certain forms. More new rules and proposals were issued in October. S&P will continue to work with the SEC on all of these issues.", "In Europe the European Parliament and Council last April approved a regulation rating agency formal approval of the legislation is expected shortly, the effective date to be in compliance is expected by mid-2010. In the next year we also expect additional regulation of rating agency to become effective in Japan and Australia. All these changes could affect the performance of S&P Credit Market Services but we don\u2019t believe they will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or its operations.", "In the fall or early 2010 we expect the US Congress to pass legislation on the rating agencies as part of an omnibus financial reform bill. The drafting process is underway and the situation is still fluid. Again, we\u2019re looking for either this fall or very early into 2010.", "We continue to review our concerns with decision makers in Washington and abroad and these include making sure that we\u2019re looking at this in a beginning to end solution so that regulations cover all aspects of capital markets to ensure effective and efficient funding. Also, analytical independence that\u2019s fundamental. Foster competition in the ratings industry by establishing a fair and level playing field and this is most important, internationally consistency because ratings are issued and used globally and contribute to the global flow of capital. Globally consistent regulation has got to be a benchmark.", "We think our concerns are being heard but we will continue working with policy makers, legislators and others to help restore investor confidence in ratings. In short, this is still a work in progress.", "In previous discussions on legal proceedings we have grouped lawsuits into three general categories. Number one is lawsuits alleging that S&P is an underwriter or seller of securities, which they\u2019re not. Secondly, lawsuits alleging corporate statements on earnings and ratings that were misleading, the so-called stock drop suit. Three, lawsuits based on state law claims. All these lawsuits are at relatively early stages of litigation.", "In the category one area, several motions to dismiss are or will so be fully briefed before court. An oral argument was held in mid-August on our motion to dismiss the case Public Employees Retirement System of Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch et al.", "In category two, motions to dismiss have been fully briefed in each of four cases. Two of these cases have had fully briefed motions to dismiss pending since May and we\u2019re just waiting for court time to be able to get judgments there.", "In category three, we are waiting for decisions on two cases. The Oddo Asset Management v. Barclay\u2019s et al and Grassi v. Moody\u2019s Investor Services et al. In two cases are motions to dismiss have fully been briefed and argued before the court and obviously we\u2019re waiting for judgment there.", "The Abu Dhabi case is also in this category and we continue to see somewhat mangled reports in the media on the latest decision by Judge Shinlin. As you may recall, the Judge, on September 2nd dismissed 10 of the 11 claims and permitted only the claim of fraud to proceed into the next phase of this litigation. As I\u2019ve pointed out in previous sessions the court is legally required to accept as true all the facts alleged by the plaintiffs in the fraud charge, that\u2019s a critical but little noted point. Judge Shinlin had discussed some of the 10 other claims without prejudice that allowed the plaintiffs to re-plead them. ", "They did and on October 15th the judge dismissed those reasserted claims with prejudice which means the plaintiffs lost their opportunity to proceed with them. We think we\u2019re making good progress here. Overall we continue to believe our legal risk is low.", "There is so much noise in the system that I want to take a moment to make a fundamental point about some very important developments at Standard & Poor\u2019s Credit Market Services. Next year, S&P celebrates its 150th anniversary. In its long history S&P has achieved worldwide recognition for the value and quality of its credit ratings. To help the market analyze trillions of dollars of debt and millions of securities, S&P created a common basis for analyzing credit risk. It developed a common vocabulary for describing credit risk and it provided a simple one dimensional scale for measuring credit risk.", "It is a remarkable achievement that enabled S&P to play an important and productive role in the capital formation process in global financial markets. But, we can\u2019t rest on that achievement in today\u2019s environment. To meet new market needs, to maintain a leadership position and to grow the business. S&P must find new ways to increase the value of its credit ratings for investors. That is one of the greatest lessons of this credit crisis and it is one that S&P has learned well.", "As investors seek more tools and analytics to assess risk more effectively S&P is responding. In the last 18 months S&P has taken important steps to improve ratings stability, add value to ratings through more analysis and features, increase comparability of ratings, increase the transparency of its processes, and add more checks and balances to the rating process and continue to educate the market about ratings and the rating scale.", "In applying the lessons of the past to improve ratings for the future, S&P starts with criteria, the framework that S&P uses to rate debt. By providing additional detail regarding rating definitions and then reassessing criteria in structured finance we have improved the transparencies of ratings definitions, and criteria.", "S&P has been making important qualitative and quantitative revisions to its rating criteria for collateralized debt obligations or CDOs. Also for US residential mortgage backed securities and US commercial mortgage backed securities. Strong analytics underlying our rating definitions and our rating criteria are key to enhancing the comparability of ratings across sectors. Since ratings provide a common vocabulary to describe credit risk, we pursue comparability. ", "When ratings are more comparable an investor can better assess credit risk across different types of bonds. Our goal is to make our benchmarks more consistent and more comparable across all asset classes, geography, and time. In our view, a rating symbol over time should aim to represent approximately the same general degree of credit worthiness whether it was for a municipal security or a corporate bond.", "Credit stability is another important factor in adding value to our ratings. We want to account for the fact that some issuers may be prone to gradual decay in credit quality before the default, while others may be more vulnerable to sudden deterioration. Last year S&P went beyond its primary consideration of default risk to introduce explicit stability measures in its ratings criteria. With the additional stability factors we evaluate two securities with similar default risk but will provide a lower rating if we believe one is more prone to sharp deterioration in periods of economic stress.", "S&P also considers other factors in its ratings such as payment priority of an obligation, following default, and potential payment after default.", "To increase transparency S&P now regularly provides more information about the assumption and its models, the use of what if scenarios, and stress tests. S&P has published specific economic scenarios for each rating category that illustrate the levels of stress an instrument might withstand without defaulting.", "S&P has expanded and enhanced its compliance efforts which are now headed by a chief compliance officer and a team of independent compliance professionals who oversee compliance with regulatory requirement as well as S&P policies including policies related to managing potential conflicts of interest.", "A risk assessment oversight committee has been established. It assesses risk that could impact the ratings process and operate independently of the rating business. We also have separated the quality and criteria of functions from the ratings group. S&P\u2019s quality function consists of a group of experienced professionals headed by the chief quality officer. They oversee the quality of S&P processes and the consistent application of S&P criteria. ", "The independent criteria group headed by S&P chief criteria officer performs a number of key functions including leading S&P efforts to develop timely, relevant, credible, transparent, and analytical criteria and overseeing the periodic reviews of existing criteria in light of potentially shifting credit risk.", "Finally, we continue to educate the market participants about ratings, what ratings represent, and how to use them. That undertaking includes a comprehensive report in June on understanding S&P ratings definitions and other publications including a guide to credit rating essentials which explains what credit ratings are and how they are useful to capital markets.", "That brings me full circle. After nearly 150 years S&P is still a learning institution determined to find new ways to service capital markets more effectively. Strengthening analytics, increasing transparency, and reinforcing the integrity of the ratings process are important steps that will enable S&P to enhance the value to investors of its global benchmarks for credit risk. ", "Therefore, let me sum up for financial services for 2009. A slight decline in revenue, an operating margin decline of 175 to 200 basis points versus earlier guidance of a decline of 225 to 275 basis points, and that of course excludes 2008 and 2009 restructuring charge and the loss on Vista Research. The new guidance implies an operating margin of 39.5%.", "Now let\u2019s review McGraw-Hill Education. All year education has been a tale of two markets and the trend continued into the seasonally important third quarter. Our third quarter results reflect both the counter cyclical growth in the US College and university market that has been fueled by a surge in enrollment and a declining elementary/high school market that\u2019s grappling with budget pressures and so far has realized only a modest benefit from Federal stimulus funding.", "In the third quarter for the McGraw-Hill Education revenue declined 11.6%, operating profit decreased 15.9%, the operating margin was 29.8%. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group was off 19.6% and revenue for McGraw-Hill Higher Education, International and Professional declined by only 1.5%.", "Reduced potential and postponed spending are key factors in the El/Hi market this year. In challenging circumstances we still expect to win more then 30% of the total available dollars this year in the state new adoption market, a capture rate that will probably match our performance last year. In 2008 the total available dollars in the state new adoption market were an estimated $980 million. In 2009 the opportunity now appears to be only $500 to $510 million which is down from our original forecast for the year of $550 to $600 million.", "As the bar chart illustrates, the El/Hi market has declined all year. Only in the month of August did industry sales come close to matching last year\u2019s results. Sales for the industry declined only 0.7% in August versus the same month last year but year to date after eight months the market was down by 21.4% and that\u2019s according to the Association of American Publishers.", "We now expect the El/Hi market to decline by 20% to 25% this year down from the 15% to 20% decline originally projected. District level postponements in reaction to state and local budget pressures were clearly evident in such adoption states as California, Florida, Kentucky, Oregon, and Georgia. Postponements are somewhat harder to track then the open territory but it is clear that they also had a negative impact on third quarter purchasing in those states. Sales in the non-adoption states declined by 12.7% through August year to date and again that\u2019s according to AAP statistics.", "Postponements severely reduced purchasing in California which originally offered this year\u2019s biggest industry sales potential. School districts there normally have two years in which to buy new state approved programs in core subjects and 2009 was the first year of the K-8 reading adoption and the second year of the K-8 math adoption. ", "As the first two quarters progressed it became apparent that purchasing levels would fall short of historical levels but the number of deferrals increased sharply in July following the passage of an austerity budget by the state legislature which also gave districts the flexibility to use their allocations from the $334 million state re-structional materials fund for other purposes. The legislature also suspended the requirement that districts buy new K-8 core curriculum programs within two years after their approval by the state. ", "The result was a statewide first year reading implementation rate of about 10% as compared to the 40% rate we had estimated in January and the 60% to 70% rate that is more typical of California in better economic times. The deterioration in California is the primary reason for the reduction in our estimate for the total available dollars in this year\u2019s state new adoption market. But, heavy postponements also suggest future demand. Let\u2019s look at the situation more closely.", "In California the last reading adoption took place in 2002 when our Open Court program was only one of two state approved K-5 programs. It proved to be very effective in improving student performance across a wide variety of districts and many local customers are looking forward as funding allows to implementing the new edition which is called Imagine It. California approved a broader K-5 list for the 2009 adoption and we are also competing there with a state specific edition of Treasures. That was the program that was so successful in Florida last year.", "Each of our programs offers a full range of classroom resources including Spanish and ESL ancillaries and sophisticated digital assessment tools. With the new school year underway, greater clarity on the retention of teaching positions and some cushioning from the distribution of Federal stimulus funds, a number of California districts are now considering using their state textbook funding for its intended purpose.", "Furthermore, districts eligible for incremental Title 1 stimulus funds can use them for new reading purchases. Here\u2019s a real paradox. Just as uncertainty drove 2009 postponements fear of mid-year deficits that may lead to additional cuts in educational funding could drive purchasing in the first half of 2010. That possibility is the reason why our field personnel are seeing new adoption activity late in the season, particularly in school districts with no child left behind performance issues.", "In Florida, we don\u2019t see much opportunity for late ordering in the 6-12 literature market, although we may see some Middle School activity for reading intervention materials. Many educators feel that content of literature texts doesn\u2019t change that much and they can get along with older books supplemented if necessary with paperbacks and library books. The second year outlook for K-12 music is better. This non-core subject can be implemented during the school year and can be phased in a few grades at a time, making it a flexible purchase for districts.", "In Kentucky the outlook for 2010 is promising for K-12 math because first year postponements were pushed by the State Department of Education due to funding concerns in the delayed release of new standards. McGraw-Hill School Education still did brisk business in Kentucky in 2009 and should do well again next year.", "Oregon is another state with many first year postponements in math. McGraw-Hill School Education captured a solid share of available business in Oregon in 2009, anticipates doing well in 2010 and 2011.", "In short, pent up demand is certainly very real in some places but the extent to which it can drive revenue may depend on improving economic conditions. Of course the decision to continue using older programs could also result in increased replacement sales as existing copies become tattered and as enrollments continue to grow. With Texas back on the adoption calendar in 2010 and Florida preparing to buy K-12 math we still expect state new adoption market to top $950 million next year but probably won\u2019t reach the $1 billion mark.", "We expect to have a sold lineup of products and services to compete for the state new adoption dollars in 2010. In Texas all grades of our 6-12 literature program were recommended for the states conforming list and reviews of our Imagine It and Treasures K-5 reading programs continue to do well. Florida has not made its state approved list official yet but our math programs are being well received in districts that are already reviewing programs for next year\u2019s adoption.", "With states still struggling with budget deficits, 48, the $100 billion for education which comes from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Acts of 2009 will be obviously a very important factor in 2010. Funds have been moving slowly into the pipeline, following the money down to the district level is not easy. Most of the stimulus dollars that reached the market by the third quarter appeared to have come from the IDEA special education distributions. Also Title 1 funds reached the market a little bit more slowly but could stimulate some fourth quarter purchasing with more activity next spring for implementation in the fall of 2010.", "The other main program is the $39.5 billion state fiscal stabilization fund which is intended to help states fill deficits created in their education budgets. Some states have already received their grant and all distributions are expected to be made by the end of the year. Much of this funding has been earmarked for staff retention and professional development but some districts have indicated that they would use part of their allocations to buy instruction materials. The greatest impact on the El/Hi market will probably occur in 2010.", "There are also several programs still being finalized by the US Department of Education that could offer new opportunities for providers of El/Hi instruction materials or assessments beginning in 2010 but with even greater impact in the out years. These include the Race To The Top fund which will offer $4.3 billion in competitive grants to encourage state level initiatives and the investing in innovation funds which will offer $650 million in competitive grants to local districts and non-profit educational groups.", "Finally, and perhaps more significantly for 2010 Congress is working on the fiscal year 2010 budget for the US Department of Education. As proposed by the Administration in May, the budget would provide an increase of $1.3 billion or 2.8% over the current fiscal year, a figure that does not include the American Recovery Reinvestment Act stimulus appropriations. The new budget includes important new programs that represent renewed Federal support for reading, which has been sharply curtained in recent years by Congress, because of perceived problems with the Reading First program.", "Federal stimulus dollars have also contributed to the growth in enrollments this fall in US colleges and universities. The effect was more indirect because it has taken the form of higher Pell grant scholarships and a higher tax credit that allows students or their families to deduct up to $2,500 a year for tuition and other college related costs including course materials. There is separate legislation known as the post-9/11 GI bill that helps veterans pay for tuition, housing, and course materials while they are enrolled in college. By the end of September more then 24,000 veterans have been approved for stipends under this new bill.", "For many students the support afforded by these programs undoubtedly made a difference between enrolling and not enrolling or between attending full time or part-time. In difficult economic times the higher education market has tended to be counter cyclical as people return to school to gain new skills or remain in school because of limited employment opportunities. The confluence of Federal stimulus funds and the counter cyclical trend have resulted in enrollment numbers that are easily outstripping earlier government estimates, particularly at community colleges and career schools.", "Although no official fully aggregated statistics are available it does appear that there could be close to a 10% increase in overall post-secondary enrollments this fall. Surging enrollments clearly help strengthen the market for higher education products which is up 11% through August and that\u2019s according to AAP reports. McGraw-Hill Higher Education experienced growth in the third quarter in all four major imprints.", "With our digital products growing at a double digit rate it also evident that the imaginative use technology is expanding our opportunities in higher education. As this diagram illustrates, digital products like McGraw-Hill Connect create new ways to connect with students beyond the traditional textbook. ", "For years publishers have focused their sales efforts almost exclusively on instructors because they select the text for the course, they still do. Their decisions are still critical to success in higher educational publishing. The new digital products have broadened the college market by offering optional resources for purchase by students. By focusing on the student\u2019s workflow we can provide critical course related content that can help them master the material they need to earn good grades. It\u2019s on online market and we\u2019ve been gaining traction quickly.", "In international markets strong demand for higher education products was offset by softness in school and professional sales and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. In domestic professional markets digital subscription products in science, medicine, and technology continue to be a bright spot in a challenging retail environment as booksellers reduce inventory and limit new orders.", "With that sum up for McGraw-Hill Education, because of the decline in the elementary/high school market we are reducing our revenue guidance for McGraw-Hill Education we now expect a decline of 10% to 11%. Our earlier forecast had called for an 8.5% to 9.5% decline in this year. With tight cost controls we now expect a margin decline of just 300 to 350 basis points and that\u2019s excluding the 2008-2009 restructuring charge. The previous estimate had called for a 300 to 400 basis point decline.", "Now let\u2019s shift to Information and Media. In the third quarter for this segment revenue declined by 10.1%, operating profit increased 29.3% reflecting a pre-tax restructuring charge in the third quarter last year that reduced operating profit by $13.9 million. The operating margin was 12.4%. In a non-election year, revenue at our Broadcasting Group declined by 23.6% in the third quarter. Decreases in advertising, declines in the automotive industry and softness in the construction market were all factors in the 8.7% revenue decline in our business to business group.", "Ad pages in BusinessWeek global edition declined 29.3% in the third quarter. The standout performer continues to be Platts and global energy market. Oil prices are approximately half of what they were a year ago. Such volatility in crude oil prices and other commodities continue to create demand for our data and our information services. The strength in data and information products for business markets will be key to our future development.", "Let me sum up for the outlook for Information & Media in 2009. Revenue will decline 9% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 8% to 9%. Operating margin will decline 200 to 250 basis points versus our previous guidance of 300 to 400 basis points, again that\u2019s excluding 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges.", "That completes the review of the operations for the third quarter and how we\u2019re looking at the completion of the year. Let\u2019s sum up the outlook for the corporation in 2009. We now expect revenue to decline approximately 7% this year because of continued weakness in school education and advertising. We previously had forecast a decline of 5.5% to 6.5%. ", "With stringent cost controls we now expect to achieve the top end of our $2.20 to $2.25 diluted earnings per share guidance for 2009. Previously we had guided to the low end of that range. The new guidance excludes a second quarter restructuring charge of $0.03 loss on the divestiture of Vista Research and again a projected $0.02 gain on the sale of BusinessWeek in the fourth quarter.", "That concludes my remarks. I think that we needed to address a number of subjects and I hope it\u2019s helpful to you. Let\u2019s now hear from Bob Bahash on some of the key financials and then let\u2019s go anywhere you would like to go.", "Bob Bahash", "This morning I\u2019d like to review the key factors affecting our third quarter results and our full year guidance and what it implies for the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll focus on the decrease in consolidated costs and expenses which were down 5.4% in the third quarter or 3.8% excluding last year\u2019s restructuring charge. This decrease occurred despite the impact of incentive compensation which increased by $68.3 million in the third quarter. I\u2019ll also focus on the influence of foreign exchange on our results, the pending BusinessWeek divestiture, and the improved outlook for free cash flow in 2009.", "Let\u2019s start with a look at our costs and expenses and the impact in each segment\u2019s performance. For McGraw-Hill Education expenses declined 9% in the third quarter excluding the 2008 restructuring charge and were down 8.2% at constant currencies. Higher incentive compensation was more then offset by stringent expense controls, savings from previous restructuring actions, lower sales and marketing costs, and lower cost of goods sold due to the reduction in revenue. For the full year we now expect a high single digit decline in expenses versus our previous guidance of a mid-single digit decline in expenses, excluding the restructuring charges of 2008 and 2009.", "For Financial Services, expenses increased 5.1% excluding the restructuring charge of 2008 and were up 7% at constant currencies. Excluding the impact of increased incentive compensation which was most significant in this segment, expenses would have declined slightly due to continued tight cost controls and restructuring savings as well as benefits from the divestitures of Vista Research and CRISIL\u2019s Gas Strategies Group.", "For the year, as Terry indicated, we now expect margins for the segment to decline 175 to 200 basis points which implies roughly flat expenses year over year versus our previous guidance of a slight increase, excluding restructuring charges in both years and the loss on the divestiture of Vista in the second quarter of 2009.", "Year to date, margins are down 240 basis points but the fourth quarter 2008 had the lowest margins of the year because the fourth quarter revenue was depressed by low debt issuance. That had a pronounced impact on margins given the high fixed cost of this business. With an expected double digit increase in transaction revenue fourth quarter margin should improve although the increase will be mitigated by increased incentive compensation.", "For Information & Media, expenses decreased 8.6% excluding the restructuring charges. Restructuring savings and lower cost of goods sold due to the reduction in revenue were key factors, partially offset by increased incentive compensation. Our new margin guidance implies a high single digit decline in expenses versus our previous guidance of a mid-single digit decline, excluding restructuring charges in both years and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek in the fourth quarter.", "As we\u2019ve indicated on previous calls Information & Media results have been affected by the non-cash accounting impact of converting studies on to Compass, JD Power\u2019s online reporting and analytical tool. Revenue previously recognized at the time of our syndicated studies release will now be recognized rightably over the 12 month life of the subscription. This is similar to the sweets transition that we mentioned to you back in 2006. For the full year we continue to expect a $12 million decrease in revenue and $7 million decrease in profit due to the impact of Compass. For the third quarter the Compass conversion resulted in a revenue decrease of $5.4 million and $2.6 million decrease in profits. The fourth quarter impact is expected to be minimal.", "Corporate expenses in the third quarter were $27.9 million and $18.2 million increase for the same period last year, largely due to higher stock based and short term incentive compensation. We now expect full year corporate expense to increase by $20 to $25 million and excluding the 2008 restructuring charge and that\u2019s down from our previous estimate of a $25 to $30 million increase. This implies fourth quarter expense of $36 to $41 million and growth is largely due to increased incentive compensation.", "Clearly changes in incentive compensation were an important factor in our results. Significant reductions in both long term and short term incentive compensation accruals taken in the third quarter of last year made expense comparisons extremely challenging. In total, incentive compensation increased by $68.3 million during the third quarter of this year including a $34.7 million increase in stock based compensation. The impact of this $68.3 million increase in incentive by segment is as follows: ", "McGraw-Hill Education\t$13 million", "Financial Services\t\t$32.1 million", "Information & Media\t\t$5.7 million", "Corporate\t\t\t$17.5 million", "On our second quarter earnings call I indicated that incentive compensation would increase by about $90 million in 2009. We now believe that the full year increase will be closer to $75 million due primarily to reductions in stock based compensation accruals as well as reductions in short term accruals at McGraw-Hill Education. ", "Year to date, incentive compensation increased approximately $40 million comprised of $68 million increase in the third quarter, partially offset by the $29 million decrease in the first half of the year. We expect increased incentive compensation of approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter because the fourth quarter of 2008 also benefited from reduced incentive accruals though to a lesser extent then the third quarter of last year.", "Foreign exchange also continues to influence our operating results. The dramatic strengthening of the US dollar in the second half of 2008 reduced year over year growth in revenue by $74.6 million and expenses by $82 million in the first half of the year. This impact will lessened in the third quarter as changes in currency reduced revenue growth by $21.6 million and expense growth by $15.3 million, resulting in an operating profit reduction of $6.3 million. If current foreign exchange rates hold the situation will change in the fourth quarter. Revenue comparisons in the fourth quarter will benefit from foreign exchange but expense comparisons will be negatively impacted.", "Now I\u2019d like to update you on the pending divestiture of BusinessWeek. On October 13 we signed an agreement to sell BusinessWeek to Bloomberg. We will receive $5 million in cash and Bloomberg will assume certain liabilities including our unfulfilled subscription liabilities. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. We will recognize a $9.3 million pre-tax or $5.9 million post-tax gain or approximately $0.02 per diluted share. Given the timing of the transaction we expect minimal financial impact in 2009 from operations.", "In 2010 the divestiture will reduce year over year revenue growth by approximately $100 million. We expect to realize savings next year of approximately $20 to $25 million pre-tax or $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share. This is net of the portion of allocated expenses such as shared services and rent that will no longer be absorbed. Savings could vary depending upon the length of the transition services with Bloomberg as well as the ability to consolidate or sub-lease space.", "The divestiture will reduce our dependence on advertising revenue. Following the divestiture of BusinessWeek advertising will represent about 2% of pro-forma total revenue versus approximately 4% previously.", "Let\u2019s now review the improved outlook for free cash flow. To calculate free cash flow we start with after tax cash from operations and deduct investments and dividends. What\u2019s left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt. As expected, we made a pension contribution during the third quarter in the amount of $20.5 million. Despite the pension contribution and lower operating results compared to the prior year our year to date free cash flow is ahead of last year by $323 million.", "As discussed on our calls earlier this year this increase is driven mainly by the significant reduction in incentive compensation payments, prudent investments, continuing focus on working capital improvements, and cost containment initiatives. We continue to expect the fourth quarter to be negatively impacted by lower anticipated receipts; however, given our strong cash flow performance to date we\u2019re raising our guidance. We now expect free cash flow for the year to be in excess of $500 million, up from our previous guidance of $430 to $450 million.", "Clearly the corporation\u2019s financial position remains strong. Net debt decreased by $240.5 million down $491 million versus the second quarter and $556 million versus year end, reflecting the strong free cash flow generation in the third quarter which is generally our strongest cash flow quarter. On a gross basis total debt at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and is comprised of long term unsecured senior notes. This is offset by $957 million in cash. There was no commercial paper outstanding at the end of the third quarter.", "Interest expense was $18 million in the third quarter, a $4 million decline from the previous year. The decline was largely driven by a reduction in interest accruals related to uncertain income tax positions. For the full year we still expect interest expense to be roughly comparable to the 2008.", "The company\u2019s effective tax rate was 36.4% in the third quarter versus 37.1%. We still expect a full year 2009 tax rate to be 36.4%.", "Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 313.6 million in the third quarter a 3.6 million share decline versus the same period last year roughly flat compared to the second quarter of 2009. The year over year decrease is primarily due to 2008 share repurchases and the decline in our stock price. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 314 million.", "In today\u2019s challenging environment we\u2019re continuing to manage investments prudently without negatively impacting the enterprise. Pre-publication investments were about $45 million in the third quarter which is a decrease of $21 million compared to the third quarter of 2008. For 2009 we still expect pre-publication investment of approximately $200 million. Purchases of property and equipment were $16 million in the third quarter compared to almost $18 million in the same period last year. We expect an up-tick in CapEx in the fourth quarter primarily related to technology spending as well as international expansion and continue to expect approximately $75 to $80 million for the full year.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at some non-cash items. Amortization of pre-pub costs in the third quarter was $127 million versus $125 million last year. For the full year we continue to expect pre-pub amortization of $275 to $280 million versus $270 in 2008. Depreciation was $26 million in the third quarter, $4 million lower then last year. We now expect full year depreciation to be approximately $120 million versus our previous forecast of approximately $130 million. Amortization of intangibles was $11 million for the third quarter of 2009 versus about $14 million for the same period last year. For the full year we continue to expect approximately $50 million.", "I\u2019ll conclude with a comment on the growth of unearned revenue which ended the third quarter of 2009 at $1.1 billion. That\u2019s roughly flat with the prior year and the second quarter. In constant currency it grew 1.9% versus the prior year. At the end of the third quarter Financial Services represented approximately 73% of the corporation\u2019s total unearned revenue. Financial Services unearned revenue was roughly flat versus prior year. For the full year we still expect unearned revenue to grow slightly, excluding the impact of the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Including the divestiture of BusinessWeek we expect unearned revenue to experience a slight decline for 2009.", "In summary, on the last call we promised that we would maintain stringent expense controls and we\u2019ve delivered on that promise. Our cash flow generation and our strong financial position leave us well positioned for growth as we move forward.", "Thank you and now back to Terry.", "Terry McGraw", "Obviously relative to one of the worst business environments we\u2019ve all endured a year ago and coming forward we\u2019re obviously pleased that the economy is starting to recover and some our markets have started to recover. We\u2019re pleased, obviously, to be improving our guidance for 2009 and obviously the improvement in free cash flow as well.", "With that let me turn it back to Don and we\u2019ll go in any direction you\u2019d like.", "Donald Rubin", "Just a couple of instructions for phone participants. (Instructions) We\u2019re now ready to take the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "The success you\u2019ve enjoyed in terms of controlling costs is very impressive. I\u2019m wondering about the sustainability of these cost reductions you\u2019ve implemented. Is there going to be some catch up in 2010 in terms of deferred expenses?", "Bob Bahash", "We have been pretty active, as you know, in trying to control our costs. If you look by segment, especially if you take a look at the Education segment part of the influence this year was lower sales and marketing costs, free with order costs, etc. simply because the adoption cycle is so much lower. As you look at a doubling of the adoption state opportunities next year you\u2019ll see an increase in those costs, also cost of goods sold. ", "We will be benefiting and we are benefiting this year from previous years restructuring actions and we will also benefit in 2010 from the restructuring action that we took in this year in the second quarter. We will see some up-ticks naturally as business starting improving for us but we\u2019re going to continue to focus awfully hard on our costs and expense.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Does your cost suggest that margins in the Education business are basically flat next year even in the context of some recovery in revenue?", "Bob Bahash", "It\u2019s a little bit early to be predicting the margins but as you know that first in a major adoption you have some higher costs because of sales, marketing, free with order costs, etc. so they do tend to influence your overall margins.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Can you share with us any granularity on the drivers of revenue performance in the Investment Services business? Specifically what I\u2019m wondering is that the deteriorating revenues you\u2019ve seen this year to the extent that a lot of this is subscription based revenues, does this imply that revenues remain under pressure going into 2010?", "Bob Bahash", "In the Investment Services area we\u2019ve experienced some pressure from the index services side simply because of what has happened in the overall marketplace. When you look at price volume from the standpoint of the impact of the overall Dow and such that is clearly influenced these size of assets under management and our fees. On the other side we have seen an increase from a volume standpoint of individuals moving more into index services. That has counter balanced to a certain degree the loss of revenues simply because of the rate impact. ", "We continue to sustain marginal growth in the environment in some of our data information products, most notably Capital IQ which continues to grow albeit at a much slower pace but in this environment showing growth is pretty darn good. We are influenced also by the loss of revenue from some of the Investment Services contract that came due this year.", "Terry McGraw", "I would only add a couple things on the Education side; we\u2019re buoyed by the fact on the El/Hi side higher ed and international is doing fine. On the elementary/high school side we\u2019ve got two really strong funded programs, Florida with K-12 math and Texas with K-12 literature. We also are still waiting to see the full picture in terms of some of the $100 billion associated with the stimulus funds on that. ", "Even with some of the cutback rate wise on the Investment Services side we added 60 new indices at S&P index services this year. Even with a curtailment of the settlement on the Equity Research side we were very pleased that we were able to get continuing contracts with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley and the new contract with Merrill Lynch. I think going into 2010 we\u2019ve got a pretty good picture starting to form.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Do you think we\u2019ll get some news or developments in terms of further restructuring in the Info Media segment before year end?", "Terry McGraw", "From a transaction standpoint acquisitions or divestitures I wouldn\u2019t comment prematurely. Clearly as I said and as I\u2019ve discussed with you is that everything in the portfolio obviously is being looked at. We want to get to higher levels of growth and earnings so we\u2019re going to be looking at everything.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Huber \u2013 Private Investor", "Craig Huber \u2013 Private Investor", "I think you mentioned $950 million of cash on the balance sheet. I was wondering how much of that is tied up in your overseas operations and what\u2019s your current thought on share repurchases given you bought back a few million dollars of stock back in 2006-2007 given what you stock is here what are your current thoughts on that?", "Bob Bahash", "With regard to the $950 million of cash about half of that is in the US the other half is spread between Europe which is the predominant location for most of that balance of cash as well as Asia, Latin America, and some of our subsidiaries that we have less than 100% interest in.", "Terry McGraw", "As regard share repurchase, as you know we\u2019ve been very, very strong on a share repurchase program. Obviously given the current environment we suspended that at this point and we look forward to getting back to it. We need to continue to see the stability and the recovery. Given our cash flow projections now and as you said, some of the cash on the balance sheet we will be giving that hard consideration.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Private Investor", "If you could jump over to Education for second, you talked about the adoption market $950 million your thoughts for next year versus $500 to $510 million this year. What is your current thought to the open territories next year? I know its early but percent change potentially for next year, the open territories that are half the market.", "Terry McGraw", "In terms of open territories they have not shown growth for a number of years now. Therefore we\u2019ll have to see what the stimulus funds, what effect they will have on that one. It could be very good but it\u2019s guessing at this point. Clearly you have 48 states that are now in deficit and the Federal funds, the stimulus funds are going to have a big impact.  I would have to think that there is going to be some growth on that side. We\u2019ll have to see where the stimulus money comes as we get into 2010.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Private Investor", "In S&P ratings as you look at your fourth quarter for business there what have you seen for the trends for the various debt categories that\u2019s looking better in the fourth quarter versus what you saw in the third quarter, what categories?", "Terry McGraw", "You\u2019re seeing some very strong growth as we were talking about in terms of the new issuance both in Europe and here in the United States, especially on the corporate and government side. You\u2019re also seeing some on the municipal size. The interesting part is that as spread narrow we\u2019re starting to see some real pickup on the speculative side and the high yield issuance both here and in Europe. I think what you\u2019re going to start to see is the return to some of that kind of investment. ", "Structured finance is going to soft for a while but we\u2019re seeing as we\u2019re saying how the asset backed side we\u2019re starting to see some rejuvenation there. Residential mortgage backed with the exception of some of the Re-Remics and the commercial mortgage backed market will be soft into 2010. Obviously the credit markets are unthawing and we\u2019re starting to see a much brighter picture.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Private Investor", "Are you feeling better about the syndicated bank loan market?", "Terry McGraw", "Better. I want to see continued activity in that market. At this point the pickup that we\u2019re seeing is welcome. We\u2019ve got to see it continue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Peter\u2019s question about Investment Services trajectory I think you answered this where you\u2019re saying assets under management tied to S&P indices have ramped and then you talked about getting some new contracts. Is it fair to say you expect Investment Services revenues to grow next year?", "Terry McGraw", "Yes.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "On BusinessWeek the financial detail you gave there at the end your estimate of $20 to $25 million of pickup does that have potential to go up if you\u2019re able to sub-lease out facilities? That number just seems low to me.", "Bob Bahash", "It would if we\u2019re able to sub-lease our facilities. We\u2019re just looking at a pretty difficult environment in terms of space requirements here so we\u2019re looking at the space that BusinessWeek occupies currently that we would be holding that through the balance of next year. Although there will be a period of time during the transition services that the BusinessWeek people will remain in our building but that\u2019s only for a few months. If we do get an opportunity to sub-lease that space earlier that would be a pickup.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "I know you commented on Education margins. On S&P margins going forward to the extent you continue to see a pickup in transaction oriented revenues and Investment Services actually starts growing are there any factors we should think about that could mitigate margin upside going forward?", "Terry McGraw", "We\u2019re actually fairly pleased given all of the things that have gone on this year in that front. I can tell you that now as we take a look at some of the additional administrative costs from regulation and some of those we were thinking that it\u2019d had about a two percentage point margin erosion factor. We think it\u2019s now more like 1%. As the regulatory environment starts to abate and we get some clarity here I think that\u2019s all for the good and we can operate in that kind of environment in a more efficient way. We think that the additional costs that we once had projected are not going to be as onerous.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Can you clarify that; is that just back in the envelope you had thought it would be like $40 million number now you\u2019re seeing $20 million?", "Terry McGraw", "Yes. Somewhere in that range.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "That\u2019s from what? More people for record keeping and compliance type efforts?", "Terry McGraw", "That\u2019s why I went through all the different components that we had put in place now and we have a lot more clarity in terms of what those costs are.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning\u2019s call.

Thank you for joining us for the McGraw-Hill Companies Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Earnings Call. I\u2019m Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at the McGraw-Hill Companies. With me today are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO, and Robert Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning we issued a news release with our quarter results. We trust you\u2019ve all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.McGraw-Hill.com. Before we begin I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward looking statements.", "Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward looking statements.", "In this regard we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other periodic reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call, however this call is for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Mr. Steve Weiss in our New York office at 212-512-2247 subsequent to this call.", "Today's update will last approximately an hour. After the presentation we will open the meeting to questions and answers. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Terry McGraw", "Welcome to our review of the fourth quarter earnings and the outlook for 2010. As Don said, with me today is Bob Bahash, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. We will start today by reviewing the fourth quarter operating results and then we\u2019ll move on to the prospects for 2010. Bob will then provide an in depth look at our financials. After the presentation, as Don said, we\u2019ll be pleased to address any comments or questions about the McGraw-Hill Companies that you may have.", "Earlier today we reported a 43.2% increase in diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.53 in the fourth quarter included a pre-tax gain of $10.5 million or $0.02 on the divestiture of BusinessWeek in December. That compares with a $0.37 last year which included a restructuring charge of $0.05 per diluted share. Revenue increased by 3.3% in the fourth quarter.", "The fourth quarter results mark the first quarterly increases in diluted earnings per share and revenue for the McGraw-Hill Companies since the third quarter 2007. These results set the stage for more growth in 2010. Our assessment of improving prospects is reflected in the guidance of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share for 2010. ", "We\u2019re encouraged by the improvement in the economy which has finally begun to recovery, albeit it at a modest pace. Financial markets are definitely improving. Bond spreads have narrowed, interest rates remain low, our Chief Economist at Standard & Poor\u2019s, David Weiss believes no tightening by the Federal Reserve is likely before this summer and perhaps not until after the November elections. We expect a better year in our Education markets.", "Last week the Board of Directors underscored its confidence in our financial strength and growth prospects by increasing the dividend by 4.4% and announcing the corporation\u2019s intention to resume share repurchases this year. We will buy back over time the 17.1 million shares remaining in the program that was authorized by the Board in 2007.", "We have now increased the dividend annually for 37 consecutive years. Since 1974 the dividend has grown at an average compound annual rate of 9.9%. Since 1996 we have returned approximately $9.4 billion to shareholders and that\u2019s through dividends as well as stock buyback.", "With that as an overview let\u2019s take a closer look at our operations and the prospects for 2010 and we\u2019ll start with the McGraw-Hill Education. ", "A solid finish in the key education markets helped produce an upswing in the fourth quarter performance at McGraw-Hill Education. In the fourth quarter for McGraw-Hill Education revenue increased by 2.6%, operating profit was $33.5 million and that compares to a loss of $12.7 million in 2008 which included a restructuring charge of $11.4 million. The operating margin was 6.4% including restructuring charges of $11.6 million. The operating margin for 2009 was 11.6% excluding the restructuring charges the operating margin was 12%.", "In 2009 Education has been a tale of two markets, a steady decline in the elementary-high school sales and growth in the US College and university market. As this bar chart shows, revenues started improving in the el-hi market in September and kept growing in October and November. While we don\u2019t have AAP figures for December we expect to see another increase in sales. ", "Despite the recent gains, industry revenue will be down about 15% in 2009, far better than the previous expectations of a decline of 20% or more. In this challenging environment we still captured 30% of total available dollars in the State New Adoption Market which will close out the year in the $500 to $510 million range. That\u2019s about a 50% decline, by the way, from the 2008 State New Adoption Market. We also won a 30% market share in 2008.", "In the fourth quarter, state allocations that reached local districts later then usual in some regions, together with arrival of some Federal stimulus funds, helped produce the pick up in ordering. We caught the wave with our basal products and our intervention programs which benefited from the incremental Title 1 and IDEA funding for disadvantaged and special education students respectively, provided in the stimulus package.", "These gains were offset by a substantial decline in testing. The results was a 7.6% decrease in fourth quarter revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group, the major reason for this decline was testing and was the managed phase out of the statewide summative contracts in Arizona, California, and Florida, as part of a more selective approach to the custom testing market. In rebalancing the testing business we\u2019re increasing our focus on the expanding formative market and the non-custom or off the shelf market, while decreasing our emphasis on lower margin custom contracts.", "We continue to win summative contracts with a selective bidding strategy. In the fourth quarter we were awarded contracts in North Dakota, Alabama, Indiana, and New York State. Acuity, which is our formative testing program, continues to show solid growth, retaining existing subscription customers and adding new ones. New York City, the largest school district in the nation is now in the third year of its Acuity contract and Philadelphia has signed on for the start of the new school year. These are multi-year, multi-million dollar contracts.", "Many district level opportunities for the new business are in the pipeline for 2010. Some states have also included the introduction or the expanded use of Acuity in their applications for the Federal race to the top funding. ", "Growth in the el-hi market in 2010 hinges on substantial increase in state new adoption opportunities. We estimate that the state new adoption market this year will be in the $925 to $975 million range. Given state budget pressures we expect industry sales in the open territory to decline in 2010. We also expect a decline in residual sales in the adoption state which usually fall off at a strong state new adoption year. Given the strength of the state new adoption schedule we think the el-hi market could grow now in the 6% to 7% range off of 2009 low base.", "Texas and Florida, of course, are the key adoption states in 2010 and we are well positioned in both. The Florida legislative session starts in March. Senate and House leaders have given early indications of full support for funding K-12 instructional materials. Math is scheduled to buy K-12 Math this year. The state recently adopted new math standards which essentially is obsolete books now in the classroom. Adoption activity in Florida is already very brisk at the district level, something we did not see at this time last year when the state still planned to buy literature.", "Texas returns to the market this year with funding already in place for a K-12 reading and literature adoption. The state legislature has appropriated $465 million for the adoption. We continue to see evidence of pent up demand in the market but budget pressures also remain until the economic recovery is further along. We may also see some purchasing postponed from 2009 in adoption states like California.", "Funding levels in California remain uncertain but some districts may buy K-8 reading programs as part of the second year of that adoption. There also is some potential for math sales at the Middle School, that\u2019s grades 6-8 and High School, grades 9-12. The governor\u2019s budget proposal for the 2010-2011 fiscal year calls for $332.5 million for instructional materials which is flat with 2009. We are following this situation closely and will keep you updated on the developments there.", "A solid 2009 performance in higher education culminated with a surge in second semester ordering late in the year. We don\u2019t have the final 2009 figures but it now appears that the industry is going to outstrip our 8% to 10% growth estimate. Revenue in the fourth quarter at our higher education professional and international group grew by 7.5%. We expect the US college market to grow in the 5% to 7% range in 2010.", "A surge in enrollments helped drive industry growth in 2009 and its going to do so again in 2010, although probably not at the same pace. Based on a number of surveys and reports, we estimate the most rapid rate of growth was concentrated in two year colleges and career colleges. We saw the benefits in career education; it was the fastest growing imprint in our higher education lineup in 2009. All our major imprints grew in 2009 and are expected to do so again in 2010.", "Fourth quarter and full year digital sales increased at double digit rates. That includes eBooks, online courses, and online study tools for students, including McGraw-Hill Connect, the industry\u2019s most advanced interactive platform. There\u2019s clearly acceleration in the pace of integrating content, technology and distribution and we will take full advantage of the rapidly involving digital opportunity.", "There is growing momentum in the eBook market as evidenced by the almost daily announcement of new devices and new formats. We will continue to look for optimal ways to deliver data and source files for each of these devices. In the near future you will undoubtedly see a McGraw-Hill eBook for the college market running on an Apple Tablet.", "All our titles on CourseSmart, the industry eBook consortium, are already available to students on an iPhone operating system, that\u2019s because CourseSmart developed an iPhone application last summer with the support from Apple. The goal was to have core educational content available on the iPhone operating system which also makes it possible for eBooks to run on new Apple devices using that system such as the Tablet.", "Consider the Apple Tablet computer, which will be introduced shortly, there is a lot of secrecy about the introduction but many expect that the Apple device will use the iPhone operating system. If that\u2019s the case, and we believe it is, we are confident that our CourseSmart eBooks should run well right out of the box on any Apple Tablet. Stay tuned.", "I should also point out that CourseSmart does not share revenue with Apple. For a student to access our eBooks they must subscribe to CourseSmart or its college bookstore partners the eTextbooks feature the iPhone application and it lets students access our titles on a device that runs on the iPhone operating system, that application is free to subscribers. About 95% of the McGraw-Hill higher education current titles are available as eBooks with interactive features including search and note taking functionalities. ", "Digital publishing also a bright spot in our professional market with subscriptions to our services growing at a consistent double digit pace and we continue to innovate in this space. In the first quarter of 2010 we will launch Access Physiotherapy, the 6th vertical or specialty sight in the Access Medicine Family of online medication information subscription sites. The new specialty offers an excellent opportunity to broaden the market for the respected Access brand beyond medical education and clinical practice to the Allied Health field.", "Our professional business group will also launch more digital products in the first quarter. Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands is a new subscription based reference for international business etiquette; clearly that\u2019s a digital product with widespread global appeal. Change is coming rapidly in our markets; growth in the digital world will be transformational. For the prepared, it will unlock huge new opportunities. ", "We are not waiting for a tipping point that means we will continue to ramp up our investments in learning platforms and content management capabilities to stay ahead of the curve in creating the next generation of innovative products and programs. The increase in marketing and sales expenses associated with the robust state new adoption schedule also put some pressure on operating margins in 2010. ", "Let\u2019s sum up then for the McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key education markets, 6% to 7% increase in the elementary-high School market, 5% to 7% growth in the US College and university market, revenue growth for the segment at 7% to 8%, and operating margins unchanged from 2009.", "With that, let\u2019s go on over to Financial Services. In Financial Services, improving conditions in the financial market, marked by the narrowing spreads, low interest rates and a growing investor appetite for yield were important factors in the strong finish this year. In the fourth quarter for Financial Services, revenue increased by 10.6%, operating profit grew by 14.6%, and the operating margin was 36.3%. Excluding the loss of the divestiture of Vista Research and the net restructuring charge, the segments operating margin for the year was 39.4%. ", "This 2009 operating margin also reflects the cost of compliance to meet the increased regulation of Standard and Poor\u2019s Credit Market Services. The improvement in 2009 in investment grade industrials and high yield issuance culminated in a 19.4% increase in fourth quarter revenue against the easiest comparisons of the year at Standard and Poor\u2019s Credit Market Services.", "In the United States, we saw 181 industrials issued with a par value of $93 billion compared to 94 deals with a par value of $78.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. That\u2019s a 92.6% increase in the number of issues and a 19% increase in the par value of the issuance. There were 101 high yield industrial and financial institution issues for $44.1 billion in the fourth quarter compared to three for $1.3 billion for the same period in 2008, obviously tremendous improvement.", "In Europe, the dollar value of industrial issuance was $93.6 billion up 36.9% in the fourth quarter. That represented 154 deals, an increase of 46.7%. There were 27 high yield deals in the fourth quarter 2009 in Europe and none in the same period 2008, obviously a clear pick up. All this activity helped produce a 62.5% increase in the fourth quarter transaction revenue at S&P Credit Market Services. For 2009 transaction revenue was up 0.2% after being down 20.2% for the first six months.", "Non-transaction revenue which represented 69.2% of S&P Credit Market Services total revenue in 2009 grew by 6% in the fourth quarter, to finish the year at just over $1.2 billion. It was the first quarterly increase in non-transaction revenue in 2009. This continues to be a durable revenue stream. It includes annual and surveillance fees and subscription revenue. If you back out the impact of brokerage fees, non-transaction revenue grew by 2% in 2009 instead of the reported decline of 0.6%.", "We expect growth in 2010 in transaction and non-transaction revenue for S&P Credit Market Services and we expect growth in domestic and international markets in 2010. International markets finished strongly in 2009. S&P Credit Market Services international revenue in the fourth quarter was up 17.7% in all regions; Europe, Canada, Asia/Pacific, Latin America grew in the fourth quarter and provided 49.4% of total revenue. Improving financial market conditions are clearly making a difference in the worldwide outlook for S&P Credit Market Services.", "Consider the changes in spreads; spreads to US Treasuries, always a key factor in the level of issuance, are continuing to narrow for investment and speculative grade issues. As this table shows, since the record highs at the start of 2009, investment and speculative grade spreads have tightened and are near the range of their five year daily moving averages. Spreads continued to tighten in January, another indication of why the month is off to a good start. That\u2019s a reflection of optimistic sentiment in the credit markets and an expectation of some stabilization in credit quality.", "The spread between the three month Libor and the Federal Reserves overnight rate, this is a key gauge of how banks assess the riskiness of lending to one another and it is down to 0.25%. We\u2019ve also seen spread contraction across the major consumer asset backed securities during 2009 and as this table shows the spread narrow dramatically in auto, credit cards, and student loans. S&P expects further contraction in credit spreads this year.", "There are other important favorable trends in the credit markets. There is a strong demand for non-financial institution paper by investors who want to diversity their portfolio. Investors have already demonstrated that they are increasingly comfortable in buying low rated bonds. In the fourth quarter 2009, 60% of speculative grade issuance was rated at B+ or below.", "In corporates, the high yield bond market has become more attractive then the leverage loan market and companies with riskier credits are lining up to tap it. Some issuers choose speculative grade bonds because covenants are less restrictive and in some cases maturities are longer. Because it is widely expected that corporate borrowing costs will increase as the economy improves, some non-financial firms are borrowing now to repay expensive debt, including commercial paper as well as bank loans. Some companies are beefing up their balance sheets with an eye on merger and acquisition activity or buying new equipment.", "The de-leveraging of financial institutions is another factor in credit market as these institutions shrink the liabilities on their balance sheet and tightening lending standards, credit availability is declining systemically. Limited availability of bank loan funding will result in a greater reliance on the primary bond market. S&P believes that 2010 may offer a window of opportunity for refinancing debt. Refinancing of current and future maturities was robust in 2009 and should be again in 2010. About one third of the estimated $300 billion coming due in 2010 was refinanced in 2009.", "There is a dramatic rise in corporate debt coming due from 2011 through 2014. It\u2019s estimated to be $2 trillion. Some of that debt may be refinanced in 2010, adding to the remaining $200 billion that is coming due this year. ", "In public finance, 2009 was a solid year and 2010 looks even better. Municipalities sold the second heaviest volume of debt in 2009, $468.3 billion. The all time record, by the way, was $468.4 billion and that was set in 2007. The biggest factor boosting issuance here was the Building America Bonds program which authorized municipalities to sell taxable debt and receive a federal subsidy equal to 35% of their interest costs. Muni sold $84 billion in taxable debt in 2009 about 18% of total issuance.", "S&P expect sales of taxable bonds to help drive growth in this market in 2010, although tax exempt securities will continue to comprise the largest share of overall issuance. Lower tax receipts and added expenses for pensions and infrastructure needs should keep state and local governments active in this market.", "The outlook for structured finance in 2010 remains more problematic with asset backed securities showing the most promise. In the US, residential mortgage backed securities market we expect to see a continuation of the re-remic activity in 2010 as financial institutions continue to seek ways to improve balance sheet capital requirements.", "In the commercial mortgage backed securities market we saw a small but marked note of confidence as issuers bought single borrower instruments to market in the fourth quarter 2009. For the near term, S&P expect very modest pick up in the activity of this part of the market.", "The asset backed securities market continues to be a positive story. Volume began to grow last March as the TALF stimulus program took hold. By the end of 2009 there was activity outside of the TALF program. Dollar volume issuance in the US market grew by 179.1% in the fourth quarter 2009. Although our outlook for the US asset backed securities issuance is relatively flat in 2010 there\u2019s a healthy pipeline as we move into the first quarter with a good mix of TALF and non-TALF activity. Tighter spreads have limited the economic incentives for using TALF leverage for many issuers. The collateralized debt obligation market will continue to be soft in 2010.", "About 33% of Financial Services revenue was produced last year by Standard & Poor\u2019s investment services. Fourth quarter revenue was down 4.8% in 2009 but was down only 1.7% excluding divestitures. For the full year 2009 revenue declined 4.2% to $861.9 million but was off 1.5% if you exclude divestitures. The expiration of the independent equity research settlement in July also was a factor in the fall off in revenue. In some key markets the year ended strongly. A new high of $247 billion was established at the end of 2009 for assets under management based on S&P indices. The previous high was $235.3 billion and that was set at the end of 2007.", "From a small family of equity indices, S&P has expanded into commodities, fixed income, real estate, custom, thematic indices. S&P indices have successful relationship with exchanges literally around the world. At the end of 2009 there were 217 exchange traded funds based on S&P indices, five were added in the fourth quarter and more are coming in 2010 and they\u2019ll be in the areas of commodities, equities, fixed income, and alternative investments. It is our strategic goal to provide an S&P index for every type of investment. In 2009 S&P introduced 90 new indices. We expect more new products and more growth from S&P indices in 2010.", "In a challenging market, Capital IQ added new clients in 2009 to end the year with more then 2,900 an increase of 9.9% for the year. Sales to new customers and increases from current customers are expected to produce another year of growth for Capital IQ in 2010. With more growth from S&P indices and Capital IQ, we expect revenue to increase in 2010 at S&P Investment Services. The divestiture of Vista in May of 2009 and the expiration of the research settlement last July will be mitigating factors in the first part of the year.", "Let\u2019s complete our review of the Financial Services with a few comments on the current legal and regulatory situation. The regulatory situation is still evolving and we continue to strive for global consistency trying to avoid a patchwork of regulatory frameworks. This is very, very important. The good news is that we\u2019re getting close to the finish line on global regulation. ", "In November the European Union issued its final regulation for credit rating agencies. By next September, S&P will need to apply for registration in Europe. Regulations are being developed in Europe by the Committee of European Security Regulators, better known as CESR. We are following that process closely. In general, the proposed regulations are based on the International Organization of Security Commissions Code of Conduct, that\u2019s IOSCO out of Madrid. That\u2019s a very good thing for them to take the leadership in terms of providing those code of conduct principles.", "Starting on January 1, 2010, S&P has been licensed in Australia to provide its ratings to wholesale investors. We continue to work with regulators in Canada, Japan, and India. In the United States, both the House and Senate continue to consider regulation of the rating agencies as part of the omnibus financial markets reform legislation. We continue to work with Congress on draft legislation. We are somewhat concerned that the proposed discriminatory liability standards would create an uneven playing field and have unintended consequences for financial markets.", "In the legal arena, there\u2019s not much to report. In the underwriter cases we continue to make applications seeking dismissal and oral arguments have been proceeding in several of them. In the stock drop suits, motions to dismiss have been fully briefed and oral arguments have been held in two of these cases. In the state law claim cases we also are making application or awaiting decisions on motions to dismiss. We are in the discovery phase of the Abu Dhabi case.", "Summing up then for Financial Services, in 2010 there will be a return to growth in revenue at S&P Credit Market Services and S&P Investment Services. The segments operating profits will grow but there will be pressure on margins as S&P makes investments in the infrastructure of its business to support future growth and to comply with new regulatory requirements.", "The majority of these costs support the credit ratings business; they include investments in surveillance systems and the infrastructure for quality, criteria, compliance, as well as risk management. We will also continue to invest in key S&P Investment Services business so that they are well positioned to take advantage of an improving market.", "There\u2019s an additional factor, S&P Investment Services is primarily subscription based. In a challenging market in 2009 the S&P Investment Services added fewer net subscribers then in 2008 and that will have some impact on revenue in 2010. Prospects look good for increasing net subscribers this year which will lead to a more favorable impact on revenue in 2011. Revenue for this segment is expected to grow in the high single digits. Operating margins will decline about 100 basis points.", "Now let\u2019s shift over to Information and Media. In that area, continued strength in the global energy markets, a soft advertising market and the divestiture of BusinessWeek were major factors in the fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter, for Information and Media, revenue declined 11.4% including a pre-tax gain of $10.5 million from the divestiture of BusinessWeek in December. ", "Operating profit increased 40.6%, however, excluding the pre-tax gain on the sale of BusinessWeek and a prior year restructuring charge, operating profit declined 6.8%. The operating margin was 18.1% compared to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Reflecting a gain on the sale of BusinessWeek, the operating margin for the year was 9.7% but it excluding the gain, and the 2009 restructuring charge of $4 million it was 9%. ", "The weak advertising market and problems in the automotive sector were evident in the 9.5% revenue decline in our business to business group in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the broadcasting group was off 26.6% in the fourth quarter and obviously especially with absence of political advertising. In 2009 advertising represented approximately 3.5% of total corporation revenue down from 4% in 2008. Virtually all of it is in this segment. ", "With the sale of BusinessWeek, our exposure to the cyclical advertising market will be reduced to approximately 2% in 2010. Political advertising in the broadcasting group will be a positive factor in 2010. There are US Senate and House races in Indiana, Colorado, and California. There will also be races for governor in Colorado and California plus spending on issues and propositions.", "The outlook for political spending on local television stations also got a boost from last weeks US Supreme Court decision to remove campaign spending restrictions from corporations. The broadcasting group also recently renewed its affiliation agreement with ABC; the new agreement will have adverse but immaterial impact on the segments future revenue and profitability.", "With all the reporting on problems of the big three auto companies in Detroit, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of the fact that JD Power operates successfully in a recovering global automotive market. Here\u2019s a snapshot of JD Power\u2019s latest forecast for the global market. Global light vehicle sales are expected to rise to 65 million units and that\u2019s an increase of 1.6% over 2009 after a decline of 3.1% last year. Growth continues in China, an increasingly important market for JD Power. ", "The recovery begins in North America with volume up 10% to 13.9 million units in 2010. JD Power will also complete the migration of its syndicated study deliverable to an online platform which will reduce costs and improve the quality and the utility of its research data. A digital transformation of this segment will continue to be a plus in 2010. Business to business digital revenue grew again in 2009 and now represents more than half of the B2B group sales in 2009. In 2008 it was under 50% of the B2B group\u2019s revenue.", "Platts continues its global expansion, strengthening its benchmark status in core commodity markets. Platts has launched a series of new oil price benchmarks for Indian markets. In December, Platts announced the launch of a new price assessment of the very first Russian petroleum stream that\u2019s flowing through the Eastern Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline for Asian markets. ", "It\u2019s an interesting example of how Platts keeps abreast of the developments in this market. The pipeline rail and port facilities in Russia\u2019s Far East provide the country with the logistics to target increasing amounts of oil to Asia rather then to the West. Over time, the operation is well positioned to serve the market as a major price indicator of spot oil values in the Far East. The exports are set to grow and the oil has wide equity ownership, key elements for an emerging benchmark.", "Summing up then for Information & Media, the sale of BusinessWeek will impact revenue and operating margin in 2010. Revenue will decline in the middle single digits but excluding the $100 million from the BusinessWeek divestiture, revenue will increase in the mid single digit range. Operating margins will rebound, climbing into the mid teens.", "That completes our review of the three operating segments and the outlook for the segments in 2010. For the McGraw-Hill Companies we expect diluted earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.65 in 2010.", "Let me turn it over to Bob Bahash and let\u2019s get the inside detail on some of the financials.", "Bob Bahash", "A major focus during 2009 was our balance sheet management. We did that in order to maintain and enhance our strong financial position to ensure adequate and appropriate access to capital. This morning I want to review how we maintained and improved upon the corporation\u2019s financial strength in 2009. We\u2019ll also look at our plans for this year 2010.", "We start 2010 in a strong financial position due to very strong free cash flow we ended 2009 with cash and short term investments of $1.23 billion. Total debt at year end was $1.2 billion, this comprised entirely of long term unsecured senior notes and there was no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2009. As a result, we\u2019re now in a slight positive net cash position versus a net debt position last year of $796 million.", "Keeping a tight grip on costs and expenses was a year long priority. Terry has discussed revenues and margins so I\u2019ll concentrate on providing some additional color on expenses. For purposes of this discussion I\u2019ll deal with adjusted expenses which represent reported expenses adjusted to exclude restructuring charges in both years as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Adjusted expenses are shown on exhibit three of the press release.", "Despite increases in incentive compensation, consolidated adjusted expenses, that\u2019s segment expense as well as corporate expense, declined 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the year. Now to exclude the impact of currency, adjusted expenses declined 3.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year.", "Now let\u2019s look on a segment basis. For McGraw-Hill Education, adjusted expenses declined 4.2% in the fourth quarter and 8.4% for the year; at constant currencies adjusted expenses declined 6.2% in the fourth quarter and 7.3% for the full year. Full year expenses declined despite higher incentive compensation as declining revenue opportunities resulted in lower cost of sales and a reduced selling and marketing costs. This segment also benefited from savings from previous restructuring actions.", "For 2010 we expect McGraw-Hill Education expenses to increased 7% to 8% versus 2009 adjusted expense. Expense growth is driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs given the robust new stated option opportunities that Terry mentioned. As I have mentioned in the past, we incur significant promotion and marketing expense in the first year of a new adoption. Profit contribution increases in the subsequent years from residual sales.", "Additionally, we\u2019re investing in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly at higher education and professional in order to provide value and choices for our customers. Expense growth is partially mitigated by savings from our second quarter 2009 action to combine our core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.", "Core Financial Services adjusted expenses increased 10.3% in the fourth quarter and 1.6% for the full year. At constant currencies, adjusted expense increase 4.1% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. The full year expense growth was driven by increases in incentive compensation and compliance costs, mitigated by the benefits of restructuring, tight expense control, and the impact of divestitures.", "For 2010 we expect expenses to increase roughly 9% to 10% versus 2009 adjusted expense. Expense growth is largely driven by continued investments in our fast growing businesses, the carry over impact of 2009 new staff hires and planned new hires in 2010, and additional investment to support our regulatory and compliance efforts.", "For the full year 2009 costs related to regulatory and compliance initiatives resulted in approximately $20 million of additional costs versus 2008. Our expense guidance assumes a comparable increase in 2010 though this is obviously highly dependent on the final form of regulation.", "For Information & Media, adjusted expenses declined 12.1% in the fourth quarter and 8.7% for the full year. At constant currencies, adjusted expenses declined 12.7% in the fourth quarter and 7.9% for the full year. Restructuring savings and lower cost of sales due to reduced revenue were key drivers for the full year expense decline. Fourth quarter expense, of course benefited from the divestiture of BusinessWeek. ", "For 2010 reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, expenses are expected to decline in the low teens versus 2009 adjusted expenses. You\u2019ll recall from our third quarter call that we expected the BusinessWeek divestiture to benefit 2010 pre-tax profit by approximately $20 to $25 million. We refined our estimate now and expense the benefit to be roughly $25 million. ", "Information & Media, the segment I\u2019m referring to now, will actually reflect savings from the BusinessWeek divestiture of $38 million as we manage vacant space and certain other support costs within corporate expense which is increasing by approximately $13 million due to the divestiture.", "As we\u2019ve indicated on previous calls, Information & Media\u2019s 2009 results were negatively impacted by the non-cash accounting impact of converting studies onto Compass, JD Power\u2019s online reporting and analytical tool. Revenue previously recognized at the time of our syndicated studies release will now be recognized ratably over the 12 month life of the subscription. This again of course is similar to the Sweets transition activity in 2006.", "For the full year there was an $11 million decrease in revenue and $7 million decrease in profit due to the impact of Compass. In 2010 we expect all customers to be accessing this digital delivery platform and the impact in 2010 is expected to be similar to 2009.", "Corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $36.4 million, a $7.4 million increase versus the previous year, excluding the 2008 restructuring charge. The increase was primarily driven by a $10.3 million increase in incentive compensation. For the year, excluding the 2008 restructuring charge, expenses were up $21 million driven by a $23 million increase in incentive compensation.", "For 2010 we expect corporate expense to increase $25 to $30 million. The primary reason for the increase is driven by higher excess space in New York resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture as well as excess space generated from the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education.", "Incentive compensation has increased in previous quarters and again in the fourth quarter when compared to a depressed 2008. Inventive compensation increased by $96 million for the full year 2009 and approximately $57 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by stronger then anticipated results and reversals taken in accruals in the previous year.", "For 2010 incentive compensation should now grow in normal patterns with projected performance. However, stock based compensation is expected to reach about $50 million compared to $22.3 million in 2009 and that\u2019s due to the three year earning and investing period which is off, of course, a depressed base.", "Foreign exchange had a significant impact on our operating results in 2009. For nine months, foreign exchange decreased revenue and expense but had a minimal impact on profits. In the fourth quarter the trend reversed, benefiting revenue by almost $26 million while increasing expenses by $36 million resulting in operating profits declining by about $10.5 million. For the year, foreign exchange decreased revenue by $70.4 million and expense by almost $61 million, resulting in a decline in operating profit of $9.5 million.", "Prudent management of investments and tight cost controls contributed to a strong free cash flow performance. For the year, free cash flow was $770 million compared to $503 million in 2008. We define free cash flow in the following manner. We start with cash provided by operations per GAAP cash flow statement, we then subtract the following items which would be pre-publication investments, purchases of property and equipment, additions to technology projects, and dividends paid to our shareholders. The result is free cash flow that would then be available for acquisitions, share repurchases, or to pay down debt.", "Let\u2019s spend a moment reviewing the changes in free cash flow in 2009 compared to 2008. As the table highlights, cash provided by operations increased $152 million over 2008 despite a reduction in net income. The primary drivers of the strong free cash flow were a significant reduction in cash incentive compensation payments, lower inventory purchases reflecting decreased revenue opportunities for McGraw-Hill Education, significant improvement in accounts receivable collections generating $50 million as the company\u2019s day sales outstanding was reduced by nine days.", "Investments declined $116 million primarily driven by a reduction in pre-publication costs of $77 million, reflecting the continuing efficiency gains in the development process as well as lower investments due to a lighter adoption calendar. Based on our operating guidance for 2010 we anticipate free cash flow in the range of $550 to $600 million. Reduction in free cash flow versus 2009 is due largely to more challenging working capital comparisons as well as increased investments that I\u2019ll discuss in just a moment.", "We took advantage of our strong free cash flow to contribute approximately $50 million to our US pension plan. US plan continues to be an under funded position following the significant market declines in 2008, though it has improved since last year end. Based on current projections we anticipate no funding requirements in 2010. However, we do expect an increase in pension expense of approximately $20 million in 2010.", "Our strong cash flow generation and balance sheet leave us well positioned to fund investments and return cash to shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility. Last week we announced a 4.4% increase in our dividend the 37th straight increase. We\u2019re one of fewer then 30 companies in the S&P500 that can make that statement. We also announced that we plan to resume share repurchases it\u2019s our 17.1 million shares remaining from the 2007 authorization from the Board of Directors.", "Unlike previous years we have not indicated either a share or a dollar repurchase target for the year. I reiterate, it is our plan to resume the program but the economic environment remains uncertain so we\u2019ll watch this carefully in determining when we will commence share repurchases.", "We plan to increase our investments in 2010 take advantage of the opportunities we see in our growing global markets. Pre-publication investments for 2010 are expected to be $225 to $235 million versus $177 million in 2009, primarily due to opportunities in the growing state new adoption market. ", "Purchases of property and equipment for 2010 are projected at $90 to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009 and largely due to increased technology spending.", "Let\u2019s now review our non-cash items. For 2010 we expect amortization of pre-publication costs to be $260 to $265 million versus $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the lower level of investments made in 2009. We expect depreciation to grow to $120 million in 2010 versus $113 million in 2009. Amortization of intangibles was $16 million in the fourth quarter due to the acceleration of the amortization of certain acquired intangibles. That brought the total for 2009 to almost $53 million.", "For 2010 we expect amortization to decline and to be approximately in the $40 million range. The decline is due to the accelerated amortization of certain intangibles in 2009 as well as other items being fully amortized also in 2009.", "Our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 314.5 million in the fourth quarter a 1.6 million share increase versus the same period last year and a 0.8 million share increased from the third quarter 2009. Full year WASO was 313.3 million shares, a 5.4 million share year over year decline, driven largely by the full year impact of the 2008 share repurchases. Fully diluted shares at the end of 2009 were approximately 315 million.", "Interest expense was $20 million in the fourth quarter compared to $15.4 million in the same period last year and $17.8 million in the third quarter. For the full year, interest expense was $77 million compared to $75.6 million in 2008 and we expect 2010 to be roughly comparable to 2009.", "Regarding the company\u2019s effective tax rate, we finished 2009 with a full year rate of 36.4% and we expect a comparable rate in 2010.", "I\u2019ll end with a recap of growth in unearned revenue. Unearned revenue ended 2009 at $1.1 billion up 1.5% from the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of divestitures, most notably BusinessWeek, it grew 2.8%. Financial Services makes up 74% of the corporation\u2019s total unearned revenue. Financial Services unearned revenue was roughly flat as strong growth for subscription products, including ratings direct was offset by reductions in equity research due to the end of the independent equity research settlement, as well as declines driven by lower structured finance revenues.", "While comparatively small, McGraw-Hill Education strong unearned revenue growth was driven by an increase in subscription based products, particularly at higher education, where digital products are growing at a double digit rate. For 2010 we expect mid single digit growth in unearned revenue.", "Thank you and now back to Terry.", "Terry McGraw", "Don.", "Donald Rubin", "Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants as we start the question and answer period.

It really depends on what the transactions possibly could be, how attractive strategically it would be and at what kind of price. If we thought that it could get more growth and better returns going that direction then we would do that. ", "It\u2019s a forever balance question. We\u2019re excited about the announcement on the share repurchase. Obviously with the dilemma, the third quarter 2008 we needed to cancel that but we\u2019re very excited about getting back to it. The level will depend on whatever the attractiveness of other activities are. It\u2019s a forever balance.", "Bob Bahash", "The under funded status at the end of 2009 is approximately $450 million. That compares to $560 million at the end of 2008.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Access 342", "Can you update us on your thoughts for textbooks elementary; high school here in the US how you think the open territories will do versus 2009? More importantly how you can get residual sales, can you also size those markets for investors?", "Terry McGraw", "As you know, we\u2019ve been watching those areas very carefully. We think the open territories are once again in 2010 going to show a decline. The number is a little big of guess work. I\u2019ve seen numbers of down 7%, 8%, 9%, I think the higher end of that is a little harsh. We\u2019re probably looking a little less then that, so mid single digits. Residuals also a little bit soft, again given some of the new adoption activity of 2008 and 2009. ", "Of course the bright spot is the new adoption opportunities for this year. Right now, unless we see some changes in all of that we see a decline in the open territories and residuals on that part, again, probably mid single digits on both of those. New adoptions in 2009 are probably somewhere between $500 and $510 we\u2019re looking for $925 to $975 for new adoptions for 2010. Residual is about $3 billion in 2009 and we see a little bit of a decline to somewhere in the neighborhood about $2.8 billion maybe $2.85 billion for 2010.", "Craig Huber \u2013 Access 342", "Could you size the open territories?", "Bob Bahash", "That included open territory as well.", "Terry McGraw", "That was a combination number.", "Bob Bahash", "Residuals in open territory Terry just gave included it too.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Should we assume that the guidance does not include any stock repurchases?", "Bob Bahash", "In what regard?", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "In terms of the EPS number, the $2.50 to $2.65 does not include the impact of any stock buy backs since you\u2019re doing any buybacks?", "Bob Bahash", "We\u2019re committing to buybacks it\u2019s just not the timing. The EPS guidance that we\u2019re giving does not reflect any benefit from the share buybacks. Depending upon when we start the impact will probably be relatively small.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "I understand the impact of increased marketing costs for education in 2010 but given you\u2019ve got fairly optimistic revenue expectations, I\u2019m slightly surprised you wouldn\u2019t expect to see a little bit of positive margin leverage in 2010. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anything else I\u2019m missing. Secondly, longer term in the good old days you\u2019ve talked about the potential for maybe approaching high teens or 20% margins in Education. How do you think about the margin leverage in that business longer term?", "Terry McGraw", "Target margin levels are going to increasingly improve because of the digital capabilities and the reductions of cost also in terms of the acceleration of revenue opportunities. When you go back with us and we talk about we were looking at the 20% margin target on that part, over the next couple of years that\u2019s exactly where we would like to continue to focus on. We think that the digital investment that we\u2019ve been able to make is going to help us get there. ", "In terms of margin, for 2010 we really have to see as we were saying with Craig, what the open territories and what some of the residual numbers are. Again, we have it somewhere around mid single digit decline. If it\u2019s a little bit more that might put a little bit more pressure on us on that part. Our hope is that the new adoption is going to carry the day and that we\u2019re going to do better in open territories then we\u2019re currently thinking which will give us a little bit more optimism. It\u2019s a little too early to tell.", "Bob Bahash", "I\u2019d reiterate the comments that I did make did emphasize digital investments.

There\u2019s been Tribune Education, JD Power, Capital IQ but nothing of substantial size. When you talk about a balance would you consider billion dollar plus acquisitions going forward?", "Terry McGraw", "The answer to that is yes. The question would be what that target is and what we thought the return potential over time and we\u2019d have to equate that back to what we thought the return potential in doing other things would be. From a balance sheet standpoint and all of those kinds of things we obviously have capacity. We want to maintain flexibility in this kind of environment and we\u2019ll be cautious in doing so. We could do a size but again it would have to be the weighing of what the potential returns are for it.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Within the Education business, the three testing contracts that will not recur, what is the estimated revenue hit in 2010? I assume that\u2019s incorporated in your guidance?", "Bob Bahash", "We\u2019re not really disclosing what the revenue is. Clearly we\u2019re seeing a decline in revenue as a result of that.

Can you please discuss that a bit further?", "Terry McGraw", "As you know and as we\u2019ve seen with the whole local broadcasting station business, network compensation for local programming has gone in the other direction. It\u2019s a small amount for us in that one that\u2019s why the immaterial comment. Instead of being paid you\u2019re paying for that content now. That\u2019s a trend that you\u2019re going to see continue.

Without getting into it, it was a very small amount but it was a give back rather then a take on that one which is the first time that\u2019s taken place.

", "Edward Atorino \u2013 Benchmark", "Did you get anything for giving up something?", "Terry McGraw", "As far as the negotiation back and forth there were a number of things inside it. Again, the number is a very small number.", "Edward Atorino \u2013 Benchmark", "It seems like you\u2019ve lowered your growth outlook in the school area. I haven\u2019t gone back and checked the last comments you made but it seemed like you\u2019re looking for a little bit less growth in the school area this year then last. You mentioned its going to depend on funding. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, are you concerned that the dollars will or won\u2019t be there?", "Terry McGraw", "Actually I\u2019m pretty upbeat about it because of the fact that the solidarity of both Florida and Texas in the market. Also with some upside look with California because they only funded 10% of their opportunity in 2009 from we thought about 40% is what they were going to do. We feel good about that part of it. The unknown part really is the open territories and the residuals. We\u2019re sizing that opportunity and relative to Craig\u2019s question we were saying mid single digits. We know that some people have a higher decline then that and some lower but we think that\u2019s a go in position on this thing. That\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from. ", "As we see that materialize and if we see it improve its certainly going to improve our guidance for el-hi.

It\u2019s a mixture of a number of properties.", "I think the point that we\u2019re making here is that the marketing costs, the complementary copies free with order costs are much more robust then the first year of an adoption. In order to secure that 30% plus share that we\u2019re after we\u2019re going to be very aggressive in that marketplace and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve pointed out that those costs are very significant in that first year.

(Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to introduce Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the McGraw-Hill Companies. Sir, you may begin.", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you, and good morning to our worldwide audience. We thank you everyone for joining us this morning for the McGraw-Hill Companies first quarter 2010 earnings call. I am Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the McGraw-Hill Companies. With me today are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Robert Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, the company issued a news release with our results. We trust you\u2019ve all had a chance to review the release, but if you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

Today\u2019s update will last approximately an hour. After our presentation we will open the meeting to questions-and-answers. ", "It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Okay. Thank you Don, and good morning and welcome to our review of the first quarter earnings and the outlook for the year. With me today is Bob Bahash, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and we are going to start today by reviewing our first quarter operating results and guidance for the segments and for the corporation. Bob will then provide an in-depth look at our financials, and after the formal presentation obviously we\u2019ll be pleased to answer any questions or take comments that you may have about the McGraw-Hill Companies.", "Earlier today we reported a 65% increase in diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. That\u2019s $0.33 versus $0.20 for the same period last year. Revenue increased 3.7%, but excluding the divestitures of business week and investor research, revenue grew by 6.7% in the first quarter. ", "When the 43.2% increase in the fourth quarter earnings per share was announced at the end of January, we said those results set the stage for more growth in 2010. Although the first quarter is seasonally the smallest of the year, we are obviously clear off a good start. ", "The economy will continue to improve this year. GDP is expected to rise about 3% in 2010. We are encouraged by improvement in the financial markets. Interest rates are expected to remain low. Bond spreads narrowed again in the first quarter, and we still expect growth in our key education markets. With that as an over view, let\u2019s now review operations and our prospects by each of the operating segments, and let\u2019s begin with the McGraw-Hill Education Segment. ", "In higher education it is called the echo effect. Second semester ordering that echoes the pattern of the first semester orders from the previous summer. In it\u2019s seasonally light first quarter for education, we saw the favorable side of the echo effect, as our higher education group once again reported solid results, including double-digit growth in digital products and services. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill higher education professional and international group grew by 8.3% in the first quarter, to $205.7 million. ", "Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group declined by 9%, to $111.6 million in the first quarter. For McGraw-Hill Education in the first quarter, revenue increased by 1.5% and the operating loss was cut by 19.3% to $61.8 million. The first quarter is typically a light one for McGraw-Hill School Education, because of the seasonality of the market that was accentuated this year in the State Adoption Market, because North Carolina did not order. ", "North Carolina is the only adoption state that usually makes substantial purchases of new materials before the end of March. It did so in 2008, again last year, but not in 2010. As a result, most of the orders from adoption states in the first quarter were for supplemental, residual or intervention products. ", "The adoption stakes were down slightly from last year, but were offset by stronger results in the open territory. We benefited from large orders from School Districts in Ohio, Maryland, South Dakota that initiated adoptions in 2009, but completed the purchasing earlier this year as funds became available. ", "The increase in the sale of instructional materials in the first quarter was offset by a decline in the testing market, where we have elected to discontinue custom contracts in Florida, California and Arizona. In a formative market, we continue to make progress with Acuity, our market leading assessment program. ", "It\u2019s early in the year and we are watching buying patterns closely, and some adoption states, local school districts have two years or even longer to purchase materials in what maybe an indication of the way stimulus funds are reaching districts. We have a year-over-year increase in industry sales for six consecutive months now. It started last September and has continued through February. That\u2019s not intuitive, because historically the fourth and first quarters are the slowest each year for the el-hi market. ", "Based on early trends this year, we still expect the el-hi market to grow 6% to 7% in 2010, even though we are trimming our estimate for the State New Adoption Market. As you know, previously we had forecasted this market to grow between $925 million and $975 million. We are now forecasting a slight decline in that; $875 million to $925 million, which still represents about an 80% year-over-year increase for the industry. ", "Although no formal postponements were announced during the quarter, our reduced estimate for state new adoption market reflects pullbacks that have become apparent in several states. ", "In Indiana, which is officially adopting K-12 math this year, the State Department of Education has recommended that districts delay purchasing until materials are available, that align with the common core standards; even though it will probably take the states several years to implement instruction and assessments based on those standards. The adoption has been funded, so it\u2019s difficult to gage district response to this recommendation, but some effect is probable. ", "As [an aside] where common core standards are an issue, we have promised to provide online and print supplements to cover any concepts or skills, not presented in accordance with those standards in the newly state approved materials now being sold. As budget pressures drive more district level postponements than originally anticipated, we are also forecasting lower spending in several other adoption states, including Georgia, California Virginia and Kentucky. ", "In Florida, the math adoption is looking very solid at the K-5 level, but some districts are delaying high school math purchases for budgetary reasons. There is also a possibility that South Carolina will delay the implementation of its 9-12 math adoption. The reduction in the state new adoption market will be partially offset by higher residual sales in these states, as districts buy replacement copies and consumable materials of their older programs. ", "We still expect a low single-digit decline in the industry\u2019s open territory sales. We are seeing some district level postponements in the open territory, but the field sales force is also identifying new opportunities as the selling season develops and the outlook at this time is reasonably optimistic. We continue to seek pent-up demand in both the open territory and adoption states. ", "Federal stimulus funding distributed last year helped some districts implement delayed adoptions in the second half of 2009, and will contribute to purchasing in 2010, but the budget pressures are real. So we will continue to monitor market developments carefully. It is early days in the battle for state new adoption dollars, and let me reassure you that our school education group is still aiming for a share of at least 30% or better this year. ", "In testing, we continue to gain share in the market for formative assessments, which is largely made up of district level adoptions. We also see new opportunities ahead for both formative and summative testing, as the winners of federal race to the top grants, begin to implement their long range plans, and as the movement towards common core standards and assessments continues to gain momentum. ", "As many of you know that common core movement represents a cooperative effort among the states to agree upon concepts and skills in math and language art, that all students should master at each grade level, in order to meet internationally benchmarked criteria for college and career readiness. Drafts of the standards have been finalized and are now under review. ", "48 states, plus the District of Columbia are taking part in this movement, which has been endorsed by the US department of education. The only two states that are not included at this point are Texas and Alaska. Applicants that declare their attention to adopt this standard by August of 2010 can earn extra points in the race to the Top Grant competition. ", "Delaware and Tennessee have already won Phase 1 awards of $100 million and $500 million respectively, and Phase 2 winners will be announced in September. Each state will have four years in which to spend it\u2019s awards, half of which will be distributed as sub-grants to the local districts. ", "Later this year the department of education will also award a total of $350 million to multi-states consortia, with winning proposals for developing new assessments based on common core standards. All this means that we expect to see a very active market in the testing business over the next few years, with the RFP\u2019s coming from consortia, states and districts. ", "McGraw-Hill with its outstanding reputation for the psychometric research, and its complete range of assessment and reporting capabilities will be well positioned to benefit for these new opportunities. Present indications are that testing development work will begin in late 2010, or perhaps early 2011, and that common assessments will be implemented from 2012 through 2014. ", "The common core movement has favorable implication for the instructional material side our business as well. We can expect to see more purchasing as states adopt materials that incorporate the new standards, and we also anticipate delivering more content to the schools in digital four, because most of the states race to the top plans involve building out their technology infrastructures. We should also see cost savings in content development, as there will be a less need for obviously state-by-state customization in the common core environment. ", "In higher education we continue to benefit from the increased enrollments. According to our own survey and information from other sources, enrollments for the spring semester held steady with the gains recorded last fall. ", "We believe that federal stimulus dollars also helped to increase enrollments last fall, and did so again this year, although the effect is not easily measurable. The funding has gone to students in the form of increased tell grants, higher allowable tax deductions for college related expenses, and a new post 9/11 GI bill that has provided educational subsidies for more than a 150,000 veterans since the fall of 2009. ", "Student aid got another boost in March, when Congress passed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act. It includes provisions to keep the co-grant program solvent and to continue increasing the maximum awards from $5,550 this year, to $5,975 in 2017.", "In the US College and University markets, students are embracing our digital products at a record pace. We saw strong growth in the usage of McGraw-Hill Connect, that\u2019s our new homework management and assessment platform, and implementations of our online courses, and in purchases of e-books. We now have more than 1.2 million registered users of McGraw-Hill Connect, and our other digital study and homework management products, with more to come in fact. McGraw-Hill Connect will add an additional 170 courses in 2010.", "Creating original, media-rich digital products in all of our markets is a priority. In the first quarter we introduced our first digital subscription products for the professional business market. They are Kiss, Bow or Shake hands, a global business etiquette database, with information on customs in more than 60 countries, and another one is Perfect Phrases for Managers, a performance support tool, based on the series of successful McGraw-Hill books that helps managers find the right phrase at the right time.", "For on-the-spot convenience, these products can be downloaded to virtually any digital device. Also for the business market, we launched a program called Select: eChapters in an instant. This program enables customers to buy downloads of chapters from our best-selling business books as standalone items. More than 750 chapters are currently available from major titles in finance and investing.", "In medicine, we added a six specialty site to our internationally successful access medicine suite; it\u2019s called Access Physiotherapy, and broadens our addressable market by going beyond medical education and clinical practice, and goes into the allied health fields. It is a powerful new site providing searchable access to our leading physical therapy and internal medicine trials, interactive imaging content, curricular management tracking tools and tests, and more than 80 videos and exclusive lectures. ", "We also broadened our market geographically by signing a partnership agreement with the Chinese Education and Research Network, which will make our access suite of products available for the first time to Chinese students, educators and researches, just more a fuel for the double digit growth our digital products are already producing in professional markets.", "Let\u2019s sum up for McGraw-Hill Education. Growth in key education markets in 2010, 67% growth in the elementary high school market, 5% to 7% in the U.S. college market, segment revenue growth of 6% to 7%, and an operating margin unchanged from 2009.", "Let\u2019s now go to the financial service segment. Here robust growth and transaction revenue was a key factor in financial services start for this year. In a first quarter for financial services revenue increase by 9.3%. Operating profit grew by 12.3%. The operating margin was 39% versus 38% for the same period last year.", "The Standard & Poor\u2019s credit market services, the 15.4% increase in the first quarter revenue was driven by record high yield issuance, strong growth in bank loan ratings, a solid gain in public finance, modest improvement in structured finance, 18.4% growth in international markets, and 12.8% growth in domestic markets. For S&P investments services, first quarter revenue declined by 1.5%. The decline can primarily be attributed to the divesture of Vista Research and expiration of contract for the independent equity research, required by the research settlement.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at these numbers. For S&P credit market services, transaction revenue increase by 33.6%, that\u2019s revenue from new issuance and domestic and international markets. The key growth drivers in the first quarter was surging high yield volume, bank loan ratings and public finance. Corporate high yield net issuance grew globally by 565%, to set an all time record for the first quarter and obliviously coming off of a lower base, it was the first quarter for this decade of great issuance since 2007. ", "The surge was driven partly by private equity backed companies, refinancing the debt they took on for buyouts in the last decade. These companies aim to preempt a so-called maturity cliff, by largely LDO related loans coming due in the next two years. High yield issuers raised billions of dollars in the first quarter as risk premiums tightened. ", "The increase in the global bank loan activity was primarily amended to extend to push out maturity. Credit spreads, that\u2019s the excess interest rate over treasury bonds decreased dramatically during the past year. Both investment grade and speculative grade spreads continue to tighten in the first quarter, and as this table shows, we are near or just below the five year moving averages at the end of March, and by the way there was more contraction in April.", "We have also seen steady and significant contraction in spreads across all asset backed security classes. As this table shows, there has been significant contraction in spread, for auto loans, credit cards, student loans, and that\u2019s all since the beginning of 2009.", "U.S. public finance issuance in the first quarter of 2010, of $106 billion, was up 17.4%, and just missed the all-time first quarter record of $112 billion set in 2007. The new market continues to be fueled by the growth build America Bonds. This program enabled municipalities to issue a huge amount of taxable debt. In the first quarter taxable bonds represented 31% of the [muni] market, well about the previous record of 11%. ", "Structured finance also contributed modestly to the increase, primarily from asset backed securities and increases in re-remic activity in the U.S. residential mortgage backed security market. But the growth of transaction revenue essentially driven by new issuance activity is not the whole story. Non-transaction revenue is a critical component and here too we grew.", "Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services solid base of non-transaction revenue grew by 8.1% in the first quarter, and produce 67% of S&P credit market service as first quarter revenue, 67%. To reduce dependency on any single market or asset class S&P created a deferred revenue stream, by emphasizing reoccurring annual fees through frequent issuer programs, surveillance fees, as well as subscription services. That\u2019s how we define non-transaction revenue, and despite changes in debt issuance levels, capital markets and the economic environment, we expect the non-transaction revenue stream to be durable for sometime.", "The growth of non-transaction revenue in the first quarter primarily came from increased subscriptions and annual fees. We are also benefiting though from increased demand for products and services, not tied to new issuance such as range evaluation services, an increase in new credits under surveillance, price increases, a modest favorable foreign exchange impact. ", "Turing to the investment services side of S&P, capital IQ at S&P indusees were primary drivers in the first quarter. Capital IQ continues to add clients, with more than 3000 at the end of the first quarter, the number increased 15.5 % from the same quarter last year, and sequentially 4.8% since the end of 2009.", "The growing client demand, Capital IQ is expanding European and Asian operations by opening new offices in Milan and Tokyo. S&P indusees are experiencing a rebound in asset based revenue, which has earned from issuers of exchange credit funds and mutual funds benchmarked to our indusees. Assets under management and exchange traded funds based on S&P industries set a new record of about 254.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, topping the record established at the end of 2009 by 2.9%. ", "In the first quarter, 21 new exchange traded funds based on S&P industees were launched, bringing the total of 238 exchange traded funds and endless permutations here as an index for every type of investment as our goal, and in March we introduced indusees and commodities, fixed income, equities, strategy and customized for a number of clients and obviously more are on the world. ", "As we look at the pipeline for S&P credit market services, here is what we see. High yield issuance should continue at a good pace, with proceeds predominantly used for leverage loan repayments. The bank loan market will continue to be active. Refinancing the age will be a factor for sometime, with $2 trillion in debt maturities due through 2014. We anticipate a greater number of investment grade corporate transactions in 2010, all thought at a moderate par amount, compared to the high levels of 2009. ", "The [uni] markets still looks promising despite constant headlines about the state and local budget deficits. But the financial press fails to recognize that these conditions have not translated in the reduced ability to issue debt. Taxable bonds are expected to drive growth; traditional tax exempt securities will continue to comprise the largest share of new issuance. ", "The structured finance market has improved, but new federal rules and regulations will increase the cost of securitization and could tamper the new issuances. Longer term, these new rules underscore the importance of securitization as a funding tool.", "Now no discussion on prospects for financial service is complete these days without a review of the legal and regulatory outlook. Since our last update on litigation in late January, the courts have begun issue significant decisions and law suites brought against the McGraw-Hill Companies and Standard & Poor\u2019s. ", "At last count, twelve cases had been dismissed by eight Federal Court Judges; 11 of which have been dismissed since the beginning of the year. During that same period a motion dismissed two related cases alleging fraud has been denied pending discovery, as in the Abu Dhabi case last September. ", "The court, and by the way the same judge [Shindlin] who issued the Abu Dhabi relief was required by law to assume the plaintiff\u2019s allegations to be true at this preliminary stage of the litigations. We believe both of these cases are without merit, and will ask the court to dismiss them as soon as discovery is concluded. ", "The 12 dismissals have occurred in all three of the three major categories of claim; and again, the three major categories of claims are one, the underwriter lawsuits that claim that we\u2019re a distributor and seller of securities, which we are not; secondly, the stock drop suits; and third, the suits involving state law claims alleging or including allege fraud. ", "These recent favorable decisions have not attracted a lot of attention, so let\u2019s review what\u2019s happened, since many of the key allegation against Standard & Poor\u2019s are starting to unravel under judicial scrutiny.", "Significantly, none of the dismissals have been based on the assertion of a first amendment defense. Underscoring again, the irony is claim by critics, that Standard & Poor\u2019s uses the first amendment to shied it from all legal claims. ", "In the first category, plaintiffs allege that McGraw-Hill is liable under the Securities Act of 1933, as an underwriter or seller of residential mortgage back securities rated by Standard & Poor\u2019s. Today, four federal judges have granted our motions to dismiss in six separate underwriter actions. ", "In light of these favorable rulings in the underwriter cases, class-action council in another underwriter case has recently amended it\u2019s complain, and this is in the fort worth employees retirement fund litigation, by dropping all claims against Standard & Poor\u2019s and two other rating agencies.", "In a second category, this is in the stock drop area, our motions to dismiss were granted in three cases, in which purchasers of McGraw-Hill stock alleged the company statements about its earnings and ratings business were misleading, and reportedly violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ERISA. ", "In the third category we can report three dismissals of various state law claims, there also have been some significant decision in cases in which Standard & Poor\u2019s and other rating agencies were not parties, in these cases the plan is attempted to assert claims against an issuer or an underwriter on the basis of allegedly misleading statements about ratings included in the disputed operating documents. ", "Many of these claims were based on much publicize testimony regarding rating agencies given that congressional hears. In three cases the Federal Courts have rejected these legal claims outright. We believe that these decisions constitute meaningful legal president, which should help guides judicial rulings in the remaining cases.", "The courts have been clear and unambiguous in their decisions, and here is what I mean, in dismissing the underwriter claims against the rating agencies and in the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund case, judge Baer spelled B-A-E-R wrote \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s allegations do not support and inference that rating agency defendants were involved in the sale or distribution of the securities such that they could be considered underwriters\u201d.", "In rejecting claims that the rating agency somehow controlled Lehman, judge [Kaplan] wrote in the Lehman Brothers ERISA Litigation suit \u201cthis complaint that we read alleges only that the rating agencies had the power to influence Lehman with respect to the composition approvals of mortgages to be securitized and that credit enhancement though rating agencies regarded as necessary to obtain the decide rate, but these allegations were all considerably short of anything that could justify a reasonable trier of fact in concluding the decision making power lay entirely with the rating agencies\u201d.", "In concluding that ratings are opinions and not statements of fact that are actionable under the securities law, judge Baer also pointed out that \u201ccredit ratings and the relative adequacy of protective credit enhancements are statements of opinion as they are predictions of future value and future protection of that value\u201d.", "In dismissing the allegations based upon alleged purported variance failures to disclose rating agencies complex of interest, judge Kaplan wrote \u201cthe securities act does not require disclosure of that which is publicly known and the risk that rating agencies operate under a conflict of interest because they were paid by the issuers has been known publicly for years\u201d. And by the way I might for more than 40 years as a matter of fact on that.", "Another critical point was recognized by the court in the New Jersey Carpenters Vacation Fund case, in ruling that investors were adequately cautioned in offering documents about the risk and limitations of using credit ratings, judge Baer wrote \u201cthe offering documents adequately be spoke caution about the risk entailed by the credit ratings and credit enhancements and disclose the risk of relying on credit ratings, the potential and adequacy of credit enhancements and that a lack of historical data made future predictions about value inherently difficult. In other words, the offering documents \u201cwarned investors of exactly the risk the Plaintiff\u2019s claim were not disclosed\u201d. ", "Few minutes ago, I said that the Federal Courts were making important decisions in these similar cases in which Standard & Poor\u2019s and other rating agencies were not defendants; they are the Plumbers Union Local versus Nemora as the acceptance corporation. The other one was the Jersey Carpenters Health Bond versus DLJ and New Jersey\u2019s Carpenters Health Bond versus RALI. ", "Addressing after the fact criticism of rating agencies judge Stearns pointed out in the Plumbers Union Local 12 Pension Fund versus Nemora \u201cnone of the purported comments made by S&P and moody\u2019s employees in the wake of the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market in 2007 \u201csupported the inference that the ratings were compromised as of the date in 2005 and 2006, when registration statements and prospective supplements became affective\u201d.", "We think there are some clear takeaways from these recent decisions. The courts are ruling that rating agencies are not underwriters under the Securities Law. Rating agencies are not sellers of the securities under the Securities Law. ", "Rating agencies are not controlling persons under the Securities Law that ratings are opinions not statements of fact, after the fact criticism of rating agencies such as those that have appeared in the press do not support and inference that rating agencies did not believe that ratings were appropriate at the time they were issued, that rating agencies alleged conflicts of interests were widely known by investors and that investors were adequately cautioned about there is some limitations of using credit rates For example they are not recommendations, obviously to buy, sell or hold securities, they never work. ", "Clearly the courts are also demonstrating that they understand the difference between credit risk and market risk that others do not is on display almost daily by some sophisticated investors who claim they relied on range to make their investments decisions for themselves or as fiduciaries for others. ", "Turning to the regulatory situation, it obviously remains a fluid situation. Legislation in the senate is paradoxical and a potential problem. A court tenant in the proposed legislation expressed unambiguously in the preamble to the senate bill says NRSROs should be subject to the same standards of liability and accountability as (1) security analyst who recommend the buying of security (2) the investment banks that structured and sole security and (3) auditors who certify the issuers financial statements and other market participants and yet as currently written other parts of the legislation would lead to the opposite result. ", "They would impose materially different legal pleading standards for federal securities fraud claims distinguishing NRSROs from all other defendants in the same case, in other words a separate lower pleading standard would apply only to NRSROs in the same cases alleging federal securities fraud violation and let me be clear here, we are not looking for special legal treatment and lawsuits for securities fraud we are simply saying that NRSROs should be subject to the same legal pleading standard as everybody else, no more no less to impose a lower pleading standard just on NRSROs is clearly unprecedented and discriminatory. ", "We fully support congressional proposals to increase accountability, transparency and oversight of credit rating agency. They should be accountable if they knowingly issue misleading ratings. We will continue to work with Democrats and Republicans to make out position very clear. ", "Passage of the bill by the Senate and reconciliation with the version passed by the House of Representatives is difficult to predict. Some expect the Senate to vote on this bill before Memorial Day, but there is also uncertainty on when the Senate in the House would convene a conference committee to work out the difference; I guess its stay tuned. ", "S&P is also focused on new SEC regulations that go into effect on June 2. A key new rule is known as 17-G5, and it requires issuers and arrangers to make the underlying information that they provide on structured financing available to all NRSROs, whether they are paid or not to produce a rating. The goal is to encourage NRSROs, which have not been asked to rate transaction to issue unsolicited ratings. ", "S&P is working with market participants to implement this new rule. S&P is also working to meet new disclosure rules on its history of rating action. We also continue to work with regulators overseas to ensure timely compliance with their new rules and regulation. We continue to push for a regulatory framework that provides consistent standards across all geographic boundaries and jurisdictions. ", "So let me sum up for financial service. The market is clearly recovering. We are making progress in the courts. We are proceeding to meet the new regulatory requirement. The outlook for legislation in the United States remains fluid, and by the way Europe is complete, Australia is complete, Japan is Complete. Revenue is expected to grow in high single digits with improvements at S&P Credit Markets Services and S&P Investments Services, and operating profit will grow. The operating margin will decline by about 100 basis points reflecting investments in infrastructures to support the future growth and to comply with new regulatory requirements. ", "Finally let us take a look at the information in the media area. In the first quarter revenue declined 8.5%, operating profit increased by $25 million to $27.8 million. The operating margin was 13.5% compared to 1.2% for the same period last year. Last year we had a full year margin in this range. The last time we had a full year margin in this range was in 2004. That year the segment reported an operating margin of 14.9%. ", "In the business to business market we had been building on leading industry positions where information and media products and services represent the standard or provide leading benchmarks. A lot of progress had been masked by deterioration in the advertising market experienced by BusinessWeek. ", "In the first quarter the impact on operating profit and the operating margin is apparent, and now that BusinessWeek\u2019s expenses have been eliminated, and because BusinessWeek was not divested until December 1, 2009 the positive impact on year-over-year comparisons will be with us for 11 months of 2010. ", "Excluding the divesture of BusinessWeek revenue for the segment grew by 4.3%, and the revenue for the business-to-business group increased 4.5% instead of the reported 9.5% decline. Revenue growth at Platts was the primary driver in the business-to-business group\u2019s first quarter. Demand for our global energy data and information products produced strong growth in both domestic and international markets. ", "There also was improvement in JD Power Associates and Aviation. Softness and construction reflect a difficult conditions for smaller regional contractors in the current downturn. The digital transformation of this segment continues to be a positive factor. Business-to-business digital products and services accounted for more than 60% of the groups first quarter of revenue and contributed to margin improvement.", "Broadcasting produced a 2.2% revenue increase in the first quarter, benefiting from a pickup in auto advertising and some political advertising. Summing up for information and media, the 2009 sale of business will impact revenue and the operating margin in 2010. Revenue will decline in the mid single digits, but excluding $100 million from BusinessWeek will increase in the mid single digit range, and the operating margin will rebound climbing into mid teen.", "That completes our review of the operations and the outlook for the segments in 2010, summing up for the corporation. This year is off to a good start, but until we get a little bit better visibility on some of the trends in our key markets, we\u2019re maintain our original guidance of diluted earnings per share, $2.55 to $2.65. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Rob Bahash our CFO and go into a little bit more depth on the financials Bob.", "Bob Bahash", "", "Okay, thank you Terry. Maintaining a strong financial position is our corporate priority. We had a healthy balance sheet at the end of 2009 and we ended the first quarter in roughly the same position. Some key measures were virtually flat with our year-end position. ", "Total debt stood at $1.2 billion and cash and short-term investment at $1.235 billion, which resulted in a slight positive net cash position. That is comprised of long-term unsecured senior notes, as we have no commercial paper outstanding. We will look at the pre cash flow in more detail in a few minutes, but first I want to focus on the expenses for 2010.", "Segment expenses were down 2.6% in the first quarter; probably expect some ramp up for the balance of the year as we make investments in technology, incurred additional expense through selling a marketing at McGraw-Hill education, and also incur expenses to increase our talent base in each of our segments to contribute to our feature growth. ", "Increased investments later in the year are a key reason why we are not changing our guidance after a referring a substantial increase in [substance] for share, in the seasonally slow first quarter. So let\u2019s look at what we anticipate in each of the segments as the year unfolds.", "As a remainder, for purposes of full year expense guidance, I\u2019ll speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth adjusted to exclude 2009 restructuring charges, as well as the loss on the divestiture of Vista, and the gain on the divestiture of BusinessWeek.", "Let\u2019s start with McGraw-Hill education. The year is off to a good start. First quarter expense declined 2.6% or 4.7% at constant currencies. The segment benefited from savings from the second quarter 2009 action, to combine our core Basil publishing operation, with our alternative Basil and supplemental publishing operations, as well as reduced expenses due to the planned phase out of statewide custom contracts in California, Florida and Arizona.", "For the full year 2010 as Terry indicated, we now expect segment revenue growth of 6% to 7% versus the pervious guidance of 7% to 8% increase. Despite the reduced revenue growth, we are maintaining our guidance of an unchanged adjusted operating margin, as we now anticipate the expenses to increase 6% to 7%, compared to our previous guidance of 7% to 8% increase. ", "Expense growth was driven by an increase in selling and marketing costs due to the robust statement of option opportunities. Given the seasonality of the business these costs are generally not significant in the first quarter. Additionally, we continue to invest in both technology and personnel to support our digital initiatives, particularly a high rate in professional, in order to provide value and choices for our customers. ", "For financial services, expense increased 7.5% in the first quarter. At constant currencies and excluding the impact with the divestiture expenses increased 5.4%. Through the full year of 2010, we continue to expect expenses to increase roughly 9% to 10% versus the 2009 adjusted expense.", "Expense growth is largely driven by continued investments in our fast growing businesses, the carry over impact of 2009 hires, as well as planned hires in 2010, and additional investments to support our regulatory and compliance efforts. The impact of investments including new hires will be more pronounced as the year progresses.", "Our expense guidance assumes approximately $20 million in additional costs, relating to our regulatory and compliance initiatives, while this is obviously highly depended on the final form of regulation. ", "At information and media, first quarter expenses declined 19.9%, or 20.5% at constant currencies. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $27.8 million and expenses by $40 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $12 million in the quarter. The segment also benefited from restructuring actions taken in 2009. ", "For the full year information and media will reflect savings from the business week divestiture of $38 million, as we manage vacant space and certain other support costs within corporate expense, which is increasing approximately $13 million due to the divestiture. By 2010, reflecting primarily the divestiture of BusinessWeek, expenses are expected to decline in the low teens versus 2009 adjust expenses. ", "Corporate expense in the first quarter was $36 million, a $2.4 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased excess space. For 2010, we continue to expect corporate expense to increase $25 million to $30 million. The primary reason for the increase is driven by higher excess space in the year, resulting from the BusinessWeek divestiture, as well as the restructuring actions at McGraw-Hill Education. Excess space will increase later in the year when BusinessWeek moves to the Bloomberg offices.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss free cash flow. As a reminder, we could find free cash flow in the following manner. We start with cash provided by operations, due to cash flow statement. We then subtract the following items; pre-publication investments, purchases of property and equipment, additions to technology projects, and dividends paid to our shareholders. The result is free cash flow that is available for acquisitions, share repurchases, or to pay down debt.", "The recorder of free cash flow improved to a negative $12.8 million, compared to a negative $56.2 million in the prior year. This is by far our smallest quarter due to the seasonal nature of our businesses. We normally incur a net cash outflow in the first quarter. Improved operating results reduced their cash out way. We continue to anticipate free cash flow this year in the range of $550 million to $600 million.", "Reduction of free cash flow versus 2009 is due largely to more challenging working capital comparisons, as well as increased investments, which I will address in a moment. Regarding our US Pension Plan, we still anticipate no cash funding requirements this year, but continue to expect an increase in pension expense of approximately $20 million in 2010.", "Earlier I pointed out our investments would grow in 2010, so let\u2019s take a look at some of the growth areas. Pre-publication investments were $30 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $12.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2009, largely due to timing. We expect pre-publication investments to ramp up in the second half of the year. So for the full year 2010, we continue to expect pre-publication investments of approximately $225 million to $235 million, a $48 million to $58 million increase versus 2009, primarily due to opportunities in the growing state new adoption markets. ", "Purchases of property and equipment were $7.6 million in the first quarter, a slight decrease versus the first quarter of 2009, but we do continue to expect full year expenditures of approximately $90 million to $100 million versus $68.5 million in 2009, and this is largely driven by increased technology spending.", "Let\u2019s now review non-cash items. Amortization of pre-publication costs was $26 million in the first quarter of 2010, a $1.5 million decrease versus the prior year. In 2010 we continue to expect $260 million to $265 million versus the $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the lower level of investment made in 2009.", "Depreciation was $26 million in the first quarter versus $29.4 million in the first quarter of 2009. We now expect depreciation to be closer to $115 million versus our previous estimate of $120 million, due to a shift in the timing of certain capital expenditures. ", "Amortization of intangibles was $10 million for the first quarter, and we continue to expect it to be approximately $40 million for the full year. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $316.3 million in the first quarter, a $4.2 million share increase versus the same period last year, and a $1.8 million share increase from the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by stock price appreciation, as well as issuance relating to employee plans. Fairly diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately $317 million. ", "Net interest expense was $22 million in the first quarter. That compares to $20.6 million in the same period last year, and $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable with 2009, which was $77 million. Regarding the company\u2019s affective tax rate, the rate in the first quarter for 2010 was 36.4%, that\u2019s unchanged from 2009, and we expect a comparable rate for the full year. ", "Now, well if those will not impact the tax rate, I did want to point out that in the first quarter we made a cash tax payment of approximately $35 million, due to organizational restructuring actions related to our international operations. Then we\u2019ll largely be recovered to reduce tax payments in the second half of this year.", "There has been a great deal of publicity recently regarding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law on March 23, 2010; and to Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, signed into law on March 30, 2010, which together eliminate the tax deductibility of employer paid retiring prescription drug benefits, which are reimbursed by the government in accordance with the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.", "Our post retirement benefits program does not include a very significant portion of retiring prescription drug benefits, which are reimbursed for the Medicare Modernization Act. So in short, the impact of this new legislation on our financial is immaterial. All that revenue continues to grow, ending the quarter at $1.1 billion, up 2.8% from the prior year. Constant fund currency exchange rates and excluding the impact of divestitures, most notably BusinessWeek into a 4.3%.", "Financial services makes up 75% of the corporation\u2019s total unearned revenue. While comparatively slow, McGraw-Hill education continues to show strong unearned revenue growth, driven by an increase in subscription base products, particularly at higher education. For 2010, we continue to expect mid single digit growth in unearned revenue.", "Lastly, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our share repurchase program. In January, we announced that we plan to resume share repurchases in 2010. In the first quarter, we did not make any repurchases so there continues to be 17.1 million shares remaining from the 2007 authorization from the board of directors. We are then committed to resuming the program in 2010.", "Thanks, and now back to Terry.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Okay. Thanks Bob and Don. Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "You first question comes from Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray. ", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Thanks. Terry you mentioned in your comments that price increases at S&P were one of the drivers of revenue growth. Can you give us any specifics in terms of what you are doing from the pricing standpoint? Then the second question I just wrote is, in the context of the potential for some change in the pleading standards, how do you think you might respond in terms of business strategy or business practices? Thank you.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Okay, the price increase is again depending upon whatever we are talking about, are all pretty moderate. If you are looking at it overall, it would be in the 3%, 4% range on that. ", "In terms of the pleading standards and the liability standard that is part of the current senate bill, we are still hopeful that we get more clarification. We are not looking to change anything Peter, and we are certainly not saying that we shouldn\u2019t have a liability standard. We just want a liability standard that\u2019s consistent for all market participants and all of that.", "So when they talk about in the legislation \u201creasonable investigation\u201d they just leave it at that point, and what it\u2019s really doing is leading to the court, what constitutes a reasonable investigation. So all we are pushing for is be a little bit more forthcoming, and clarify the decision, but we think we have a good chance of getting that part done. ", "If for whatever reason, the pleading standard for rating agencies was lower, it would impact us, because what we would do is, in terms of rating activity, we would probably not rate some smaller more speculative emerging companies, and that doesn\u2019t do anybody any good, and it limits the capital formation process. So we are pushing hard for clarification on what a reasonable investigation is, and I think at the end of the day we\u2019ll get that.", "Peter Appert \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thanks Terry, and then just one follow up for Bob. On the repurchase Bob, any particular reason why you didn\u2019t jump in the first quarter, and do you have a thought in terms of how many shares you might buy this year?", "Bob Bahash", "", "No, if I mentioned on the call back in January, we indicated that we were going to enter the year on a cautious basis. So we really stayed that course for the first quarter, and I did indicate on that quarter that we would repurchase the 17.1 million shares overtime, and did not specify how much in the year, and we are really not prepared to really talk to how much for the given year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from William Bird - Bank of America. ", "William Bird \u2013 Bank of America", "", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit to education and how you think about 2010 in terms of residual and open territory sales development. Thank you.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Yes, hi Bird. Yes, as we were saying, we are looking for some modest increases. Overall near a 6% or 7% revenue growth, and that would constitute some recovery in the open territories, which we saw in the first quarter on that one. So again, modest increases in the open territory, and because of Texas and Florida we see some increases there.", "Bob Bahash", "Thanks. Let me add some color to that. We are looking at a very robust new adoption calendar as you know, and we feel pretty good about the size of that calendar and hopefully that will hold together. ", "The overall increase of 6% to 7% is of course weighted to reflect the very significant percentage growth from the adoption state, but for residuals in open territories, although they performed very good in what is a light quarter, that being the first quarter, we still are being cautious for the year. ", "Hopefully as Terry points out we hope to see some increase, but we are anticipating roughly a decline in open territories in the 3% range on a full year basis on residuals in the high single digits, but I know Terry is encouraged by what happened in our first quarter. ", "We hope it carries through, but in terms of how we came to the 6% to 7%, its weighted for the very significant increase in the adoption space, with the clients both in residuals and open territories.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Craig Huber - Access 342. ", "Craig Huber- Access 342", "", "Incentive compensation, can you speak to how large that number was in the first quarter versus a year ago?", "Terry McGraw", "", "The incentive compensation was not a significant increase, so that\u2019s why we did not talk about incentive compensation in terms of year-to-year change.", "Craig Huber- Access 342", "", "Okay, and then also on the non-transaction revenue, if I remember correctly, your first quarter last year was more depressed just given the timing of I guess some annual contrasts that didn\u2019t get booked till the second quarter, usually they get booked in the first quarter. Is that correct; in other words, I assume you are not assuming up to 8% for non-transaction for the year, correct, as you are on the first quarter?", "Terry McGraw", "", "I am not sure, can you ask that again please.", "Craig Huber- Access 342", "", "I am sorry. Was your non-transaction revenues in the first quarter a year ago artificially depressed because of timing, that probably 8% growth this year was kind of artificially high?", "Terry McGraw", "", "That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s right. We are expecting growth this year, but last year it was artificially higher, correct.", "Craig Huber- Access 342", "", "Okay. Then my last question please, can you just give us a ballpark of your digital revenues within elementary, high school and college, how much does digital represent of the revenues in each of those areas, and your outlook for these unit percentages?", "Bob Bahash", "", "Well, digital revenue overall for McGraw-Hill Education in total that came through professional is still in the single digit levels, and that\u2019s influenced more by the lower percentage of digital coming out of your K-12 space. ", "On the other hand, when we look at the higher education professional, that\u2019s where we are seeing some significant growth, and that relates to the point I mentioned about the growth and on revenue.", "A big contributor to our year-to-year change in higher education revenue in the first quarter is coming from digital, which is getting up close to half of the growth that we saw. Professional represents, because of the nature of that business. Almost 25% of the revenue of professional is digital and higher education is a pre-solid number as well. So it\u2019s roughly in the range of 14%, 15% for the higher education professional international segment and growing.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Yes, and growing at a faster rate.", "Craig Huber- Access 342", "If I can just ask one other thing Terry, you spoke a little bit about the US bank loan market, what is sort of your outlook for this year for that market, and I guess for Europe as well?", "Terry McGraw", "", "As in the first quarter, and what we project for the rest of the year and probably into 2011, we see a good high yield market, and the bank loan rating market being very solid as well. So both of those markets I think are going to be contributors all year on that one, as is the public finance market.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Brian Shipman - Jefferies. ", "Brian Shipman \u2013 Jefferies", "", "First question is, what was pricing like in the higher education textbook market? Then second, with respect to financial services, just quickly on capital IQ, what area of this business functionality would you like to improve, fixed income being important, and how would you weigh the bill versus buy decision? Thank you.", "Terry McGraw", "", "Good morning Brian. Pricing on the higher hand, again it differs a little bit by category, but overall about 4%. On the capital IQ side, its across the board, both in terms of the pre-trade and post-trade net aspects of the market, and we are looking for a functionality increased capabilities in terms of a number of portfolio management capabilities, both on the equity and the fixed income side, so it\u2019s across the board.", "Brian Shipman \u2013 Jefferies", "How would you weigh the build versus buy decision on that investment possibility?", "Terry McGraw", "Well, first of all you\u2019ve got to have a very very steady and comprehensive organic growth component here. You are constantly working the customer needs and developing product there as well, and obviously being able to add certain data sets and as well as analytic capabilities as well. We like the organic side of this, but are also looking at a number of transactions that could also enhance a customers offering.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs", "", "Just two questions; first is kind of an update on the legal liability standards and kind of where you think credit rating agency reform falls within the list of things to be debated. If branch linking is maybe the first thing that people are talking about, how much airtime is legal liability for you guys giving? ", "Terry McGraw", "Well, again we are talking about the completion of the financial overhaul reform bill, and as the senate version now has it, the legal liability standard is something that we think is very justifiable and important to the bill for us. What we are again looking for is clarification of what? Reasonable investigation leads and if you read leave of these things sort of ambiguous you\u2019re leaving it to the courts to define where they are. ", "We think at the end of the day that we\u2019ll see some clarification on the language, that\u2019s all we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re not talking about reducing the liability standards. We think that the liability standard for all market participation should be the same and not different from one of the participants namely us on that one. So if we can clarify some of the language and I think that should be a pretty easy lift on that one, we are fine.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs", "And then just question on capital allocation and color on the rationale and share repurchases, but is it that financial form that you are working to get through the other and look at putting more capital to work for purchase is a potential acquisitions?", "Terry McGraw", "Yes, again we are balancing all aspects of organic acquisition, share repurchase, and so forth. We have been obviously very committed to share we purchase. We announced that we are going to resume it and we will be into that very shortly. We are excited about the share repurchase component.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and just a follow on to that on the potential acquisitions, is there a thought to sizing or what potentially could be put to use in 2010.", "Terry McGraw", "Yes, I mean again I think that the activity has picked up and we are obviously looking at all aspects of this, but again we have a very large organic component right now, and most of our transactions are smaller in nature that we are looking at.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Meltz - JCMC.", "Michael Meltz \u2013 JCMC", "Just two quick questions, what was the actual revenue loss from testing contracts and education in Q110 and what should that run in the next few quarters?", "Terry McGraw", "We do not disclose that size of that revenue, but we simply are pointing out that we are shifting our focus here very heavily to the formative testing opportunities with our acuity program, which is just growing very, very rapidly. ", "This is an electronic based program. We are seeing tremendous market gains and shares and such, and some of the contracts that we had was just simply older contracts that where lower margin contracts that we chose to let them wind down, but we don\u2019t break that out specifically.", "Bob Bahash", "You know Michael the growth is going to be on the formative side and it is going to be very, very important, and when we start talking about the common core standards and the role that assessments going to be playing, with assessment being embedded into the education materials, it\u2019s going to take on even more significant and so that\u2019s what we are doing. We are concentrating more on the formative side and pulling back from some of that large custom contracts that year before we\u2019ve been in.", "Michael Meltz - JCMC", "", "And then just a quick follow up. For the Information & Media business, in 15% to 20% I know you guys gave guidance for the margin for the year, but is that a run rate your comfortable with going forward, 15% to 20% margin?", "Bob Bahash", "Yes at this point it\u2019s a little early, but the mid margin range is probably what we are more looking at here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Atorino with Benchmark", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Company", "I know television is pretty small, but some broadcasters reported double-digit gains and your reporting only 2%. Was there anything in your markets that kept the growth rate down?", "Terry McGraw", "Except for the fact that obviously in some of the network compensation issues for us, we\u2019ve dealt with that net upfront and again as you know, we are paying ABC now. They are in the reverse and there\u2019s that effect, but I think it\u2019s going to be a much-improved year and especially for us in the San Diego and Denver markets, and some of the Hispanic TV affiliations, they are looking good.", "I think that the [pogo] advertising one is the wild card for this year, and we are clerical advertising in the first quarter. Usually you won\u2019t see until the end of the second quarter, but we are already starting to see it.", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Company", "What are your pacings for the second quarter in television?", "Terry McGraw", "Pacings are running much better than the first quarter Ed.", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Company", "You don\u2019t want to be any more specific in that.", "Terry McGraw", "No, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s early in the quarter at this point, but right now our pacings are running pretty good.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from [Drew Figdor \u2013 Peterman & Co.] ", "Drew Figdor \u2013 Peterman & Co.", " ", "We read in the reports recently about the whole IDP situation thing, and I saw in these reports recently you guys pulled out of, and also if you can help us understand what your current strategy is with relation to M&A, sort of if you like an opportunity that seem to fit with you. So whether you guys weren\u2019t interested in things sue to size or weather it was something more specific?", "Terry McGraw", "Drew, as a matter of good practice, we don\u2019t comment on any potential transactions or not transactions on that. Clearly in terms of use of free cash flow; one, we are very focused on the dividend and the share repurchase program. We need to take care of all of our organic growth needs and we continue to look at possible transactions that are still gaps within some of our offerings. ", "We are looking hard across the board in terms of all three operating segments, but again any kind of transaction needs to fill a gap that we would have in terms of any kind of customer offering, but we have to stay very active in the market and we continue to look at a lot of different things, and we\u2019ll weight them relative to the other offerings that we have.", "Operator", "That concludes this mornings\u2019 call.

Revenue grew by 5.5% in the third quarter, but increased 6.8% if you exclude the divestiture of BusinessWeek. Based on that strong performance in the seasonally most important quarter of the year, we are increasing our guidance for 2010. We now anticipate earnings per share this year in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and we expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes the one-time gain of $0.02 from divestitures, but does include dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions. There were many contributors to our strong third quarter. We are very pleased to be firing on so many cylinders. This morning, we'll provide the details on how those results were achieved.", "Let's begin with the review of the Financial Services segment. The third quarter is normally the slowest each year in the Ratings business, but not this year, when S&P Credit Market Services produced the most revenue in any quarter so far this year. It is also noteworthy that the growth is coming without the benefit of a recovery in the structured finance market and despite a decline in European issuance. Revenue for S&P Credit Market Services in the third quarter increased by 11.1% based on strong performances in domestic markets. Domestic revenue grew about 20.9%. International revenue was up 0.9%. Revenue for S&P Investment Services grew by 6.3%. For Financial Services in the third quarter, revenue grew by 9.5%, including a $7.3 million pretax gain on divestitures. Operating profit increased by 6.6%. The operating margin was 39.2%, and it reflects the pretax gain on the divestitures and increases in incentive compensation, incremental cost for compliance and substantial staff increases overseas, basically and mainly in India and the acquisition  of TheMarkets.com. Our revenue growth was driven by increased refinancing activity, the investors search for yield, a robust bank loan market and recovery in the equity market, which benefited S&P Indices.", "Spreads, the excess interest rate over treasury bonds is a key factor in the level of issuance volume. The composite spread on speculative grade bonds hit a two-year low at the end of April at 553 basis points and then began widening, but spreads began tightening in September and as our table shows, that trend has continued into October. At S&P Credit Market Services, the global high yield new issue market took off in the third quarter. After a slight decline in new issuance in July compared to the same period last year, the global high yield markets started climbing in August, and kept on climbing in September. The global high yield market has already produced more new issued dollar volume in nine months this year than it has in any previous single year. Companies are taking advantage of falling yields to refinance debt and repair the their balance sheets, as this S&P report shows, more than 2/3 of the high yield volume in the United States went for refinancing in the third quarter and for the year-to-date. High-yield issuers are finding a receptive market as investors search for yield at a time when cash is producing anemic returns. And as banks continue to deleverage, investment grade issuers are also stepping up their activity in the bond market to lock in low yields.", "The composite spread for investment grade bonds widened over the past month when it was 200 basis points. The spread in mid October of 203 basis points is still slightly above the five-year daily moving average of 198 basis points. Global bank loan ratings also soared in the third quarter, although the absolute volume is still on the low end of the historical averages, fundamentals remained strong, liquidity is good in the United States, and only slightly less so in Europe. There is usually a seasonal slowdown in the summer months and in municipal market, but while the dollar volume of public finance issuers declined in the third quarter, deal volume actually increased. It was fueled by refundings, which were up 11% and the taxable Build America Bonds program, the taxable bond program, which was launched last April has been a boon to municipalities. Taxable bond debt year-to-date accounts for 32% of the muni market.", "The structured finance market is still struggling to recover. The current residential mortgage-backed securities market cannot compete with the spreads on structured vehicles that benefit from explicit or implicit government support provided to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Ginny Jamie. Refinancing needs have been the source of securitizations for residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities this year, but re-REMIC activity declined in the third quarter, and the residential mortgage-backed market remains under pressure in the face of continued uncertainty over home prices and a sluggish economic recovery.", "We are seeing AAA-rated three-year spreads across major asset-backed asset classes, and this would include auto, credit card receivables, student loans, and we're seeing these spreads continue to tighten. The asset-backed securities market has benefited all year from strong auto and student loan issuance, which helped offset a general slowdown in credit card issuance, new regulatory requirements and higher capital cost of bank securitizations have tempered credit card issuance this year. New issuance in the fourth quarter is off to a solid start for corporate. It appears that high-yield issuers are continuing to find a receptive market, and investment grade issuers are still taking advantage of attractive funding rates. We also expect cash to continue to pour into the leveraged loan market, filling the institutional pipeline. Favorable rates and heavy demands should continue to fuel this market.", "The structured finance market will also have to adjust to a number of new measures, resulting from the Dodd-Frank legislation, also the new FDIC Safe Harbor rules and new SEC regulations that impose restrictions on sponsors of securitization and greater regulatory oversight on transactions. Greater disclosure and transparency will benefit investors and after a period of adjustment, S&P expects the use of securitization to be a significant funding tool for many issuers in the years ahead.", "At S&P Investment Services, growth at S&P Indices and expansion by Capital IQ were clearly third quarter highlights. Assets under management based on S&P Indices and exchange traded funds set a new record at the end of September, $260.4 billion. That's a 17.9% year-over-year increase and a 12.9% sequential increase over the second quarter of 2010. Growth in spiders and high shares in exchange traded funds were major contributors to the growth.", "19 new exchange traded funds links to S&P Indices were launched in the third quarter. That includes nine new Vanguard exchange traded funds based on our core U.S. indices, including the S&P 500. So in the aggregate now, there are 278 exchange traded funds based on S&P Indices. There also was 7.3% growth in the average daily volume for major exchange traded derivatives based on S&P Indices. The daily average in the third quarter was 3,069,000. At the end of each quarterly report, you can expect more new indices from us. This quarter is no exception. You can expect them in various asset classes, including commodities, fixed income and equities. It was also a historic first for S&P Indices in the third quarter. They licensed the Options Clearing Corporation to handle trades of over-the-counter S&P index-based option contracts and to receive royalties. This is the first time S&P has licensed its indices to a clearinghouse for central counter-party clearing.", "Capital IQ continued its expansion in global markets, with the acquisition in September of TheMarkets.com. The acquisition positions Capital IQ for significant growth on the buy side. There is only modest overlap between TheMarkets.com's more than 2,000 clients and Capital IQ's 3,300 clients. We expect in the aggregate to add clients, and revenue, great cost synergies and to grow in both domestic and international markets. With this acquisition, Capital IQ now has earnings models, estimates, fixed income, research that are all a part and a key part of the buy side's workflow. This diagram illustrates how the acquisition improves Capital IQ's competitive offering to the buy side, private equity, venture capital, Investor Relations, as well as the business development departments at corporations. Those open circles indicate little or no availability. The acquisition fills in, and this acquisition fills in these circles with a complete investment research and analysis platform for asset managers worldwide based on contributions for more than 1,000 research and estimate contributors.", "On the regulatory front, a lot of the uncertainty is now behind us. S&P has filed its application as called for by the European regulations, which took effect on September 7. S&P expects to be registered later this year. S&P received its license in Japan as an approved agency before the October deadline, and we're also discussing new regulatory proposals with Hong Kong, Canada and Taiwan. In the United States, SEC rule making will be required to implement many of the provisions of the new Dodd-Frank Act. We continue to engage with the SEC and market participants as part of the rule-making process.", "In anticipation of new regulations, S&P has made significant investments in technology platforms and staffing for quality, criteria, compliance and risk management. We call this our QCCR framework, and again, that's quality, criteria, compliance and risk. And these are four individual groups within S&P that performed these various functions. In 2009, S&P spent about $63 million for QCCR-related items. This year, spending will increase by about $15 million, mostly in the second half of this year and on a preliminary basis, incremental cost next year could be somewhere in the $12 million to $15 million range, and we're still trying to narrow in on that. Price increases have helped us to mitigate some of these costs, including the incremental expenses for QCCR-related items, we expect that price increases will help us again next year.", "We also continue to monitor the impact of new regulations on bank lending. Regulators are forcing banks to shrink their balance sheets. It is already apparent that banks are retrenching and ceding out one of the busiest periods in the corporate bond market. With banks expected to keep more capital, it is inevitable that they will support less debt, and reduced bank lending is obviously a plus for the public debt markets.", "Our assessment of legal risk facing the corporation is low, and that remains unchanged. 15 of our motions to dismiss complaints have not been granted, and five more cases have been withdrawn, that's 20. Last Friday, there was another favorable ruling in the case of Rice versus S&P and Moody's, a federal district court in California dismissed, with prejudice, a complaint concerning plaintiffs investments in Fannie Mae securities. There was some key points in this decision that we're studying. In dismissing the intentional misrepresentation claim, Judge Cormac Carney wrote, and I quote, \"Defendants credit ratings are opinions of the future creditworthiness or value of companies and therefore, are not actionable unless plaintiffs can demonstrate the defendants' representatives who publish credit ratings actually knew that credit ratings were false or did not believe that the credit ratings were true at the time that each credit rating was issued\". The judge also recognize that a negligent misrepresentation claim concerning a professional opinion can only be stated by \"A narrow and circumscribed group of persons to whom or for whom the misrepresentations were made. The rational for limiting liability to a specific group of persons is to protect professionals, who provide information from unlimited and uncertain liability\". In these important ways, this ruling recognizes limitations facing plaintiffs, who seek to assert legal claims concerning to S&P's ratings.", "In Italy, there was a development earlier this month in the prime lot litigation, which got started in the fall of 2005. On October 1, two court-appointed expert, both accountants, filed a report that was critical of the ratings assigned to prime lot by S&P during the timeframe of 2000 to 2003. The S&P expert disputed the methodology, findings and conclusions of the accountant report, which is a matter of laws not binding in court. The judge who appointed the two accountants to assist her in her determination has scheduled a hearing in early January. We continue to believe that the outcome of this litigation against two subsidiaries of The McGraw-Hill Companies should not have any material adverse effect on our condition.", "Let's sum up for Financial Services. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We had expected a 100 basis point decline in the operating margin. We are now expect 150 basis point decline in the operating margin, primarily due to the acquisition of TheMarkets.com.", "Okay, with that, let's move over to McGraw-Hill Education operations.  In the seasonally most important quarter of the year for Education, we grew both in the elementary-high school market and in the U.S. Higher Education markets, and we did so with an operating margin of 33.9% for the segment. And this includes a 40 basis points from the gain on a divestiture. That still makes this year's third quarter performance by McGraw-Hill Education the best since 2007 on an operating margin of 35.0% was reported.", "For McGraw-Hill Education in the third quarter, revenue increased 5.5%. Operating profit, including the $3.8 million pretax gain on the divestiture, grew by 19.9%. The operating margin of 33.9% compares to 29.8% for the same period last year. Control of costs and expenses and improved results in the elementary-high school market and the U.S. Higher Education market contributed to this performance. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education Group increased by 6.7%. Revenue for the McGraw-Hill Higher Education professional and international grew by 4.3%. As we had expected, state new adoptions were key to our performance in this year's el-hi [elementary-high] market. We're on track to capture about 30% of this year's state new adoption market at 825 million to 875 million this year, the state new adoption market will grow 65% to 75% over last year. This increased spending is the prime reason why we expect the el-hi market to grow 4% to 6% this year.", "According to the most recent AAP, that's the Association of American Publishers' report, sales in the el-hi market were up 8% through August because of a 24.7% increase in state adoption sales. Open territory sales after eight months were down 7.3%. These non-adoption states represented 44.8%, roughly 45% of this year's revenue. Based on the August results, the el-hi market could hit the high end of our 4% to 6% growth forecast if industry sales remained flat with the last four months of 2010. As this marked chart shows, industry sales grew in each of the last four months of 2009, so achieving that level of growth will be challenging. September results for the industry are not yet available, but indications are that overall sales slowed during the month, adding to the challenge. For McGraw-Hill, however, September was another strong month, especially in adoption states.", "Reading, literature and math represented the biggest revenue opportunities in this year's state new adoption market. The McGraw-Hill School Education Group did particularly well in the very large K-5 reading market, with strong performances in Texas and California. The school group expects to capture about 45% of the K-5 reading market and approximately 32% of the K-12 reading and literature opportunity. This school group's K-5 Treasures program is the key to its success in reading. In math, the school group expects to win more than 40% of the secondary school market, with programs in Florida, California, Indiana, West Virginia and Oklahoma. But underperformance in Florida's K-5 math adoption will probably hold our overall capture rate in K-12 math to about 28%.", "Open territory sales were down in the third quarter for us, as well as for the industry, a reflection of budget pressures in such states as New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri. In testing, the third quarter is normally slow and this year, we had the additional impact of the planned phaseout of custom contracts in Florida, California and Arizona. Procedural delays in signing some important contracts were also a factor, but those issues will be settled in the fourth quarter, a seasonally important period in the testing market.", "A really fine year is taking shape in the U.S. Higher Education market. For the second year in a row, the U.S. Higher Education market is benefiting from increased enrollments. An important driver is the federal government's huge step up in the student aid area under the new administration, spending on student aid has increased by nearly 50% to $145 billion. We think increased aid is reflected in the growing Higher Education enrollments that we are seeing at the start of the new school year. Preliminary information indicates that fall enrollments at colleges and universities grew by 4% to 5% this year, an increase we had not anticipated at the beginning of 2010. Enrollments in the fall of 2009 grew by 7% to 8%. All of our major product lines produced year-over-year growth in the Higher Education market in the critical third quarter, and there is added impetus from the double-digit growth of digital products and services. Our lineup of homework management, assessment and tutoring products for college and university students is gaining traction and expanding the addressable market.", "Through September, registrations for these products have grown to $1.9 million, a 26% year-over-year increase. McGraw-Hill Connect, that's our all digital teaching and learning platform, is our leader in this rapidly growing market, and we continue to strengthen it. That's why we recently acquired Tegrity whose scalable, automated lecture capture service has become a core feature of McGraw-Hill Connect since it was introduced last fall. Lecture capture gives students the ability to review material presented in the classroom any time, anywhere, for replay online or on any mobile device. That is a powerful tool for studying and learning. More than 200 educational institutions already use the Tegrity cloud-based service.", "We have also launched McGraw-Hill Create. It is a Google-like search engine that enables instructors to customize quality content for their courses. They can draw in 4,000 McGraw-Hill textbooks, 5,500 articles 11,000 literature, philosophy and humanities readings, and 25,000 business case studies from such providers as the Harvard Business School. Once a customized text has been developed on Create, the instructor can get a digital review copy in less than an hour. Printed review copies will be delivered in only three to five days. Students can purchase McGraw-Hill Create eBooks to the McGraw-Hill eBook store or buy printed copies at the campus bookstore. And through the recently announced partnership with Blackboard, instructors will have access to the full suite of McGraw-Hill Create content through their Blackboard accounts.", "If you're looking for a window into our future in digital and international markets, take a look at this next slide. It's a custom site for the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport in Egypt. It is hosted on McGraw-Hill Education's international Create eBook Store, which is now live around the world. The McGraw-Hill Create eBook store made it possible to deliver 36 titles to this Egyptian institution for students to use in their new semester. The customer selection of 36 titles underscores the scope of McGraw-Hill's global content creation. The list includes titles drawn from U.S. McGraw-Hill Higher Education or U.S. professional catalog, as well as original titles published by our subsidiaries in India and in Europe. Because of the capabilities of McGraw-Hill Create, 30 of the titles will be delivered directly to students using institutionally purchased access codes at the school's request. Six titles will be delivered as eBooks for testing the student experience with the enTourage, that's the Ed.D trademark, it's a new e-reader.", "Another site has been established at the Rotterdam School of Business in the Netherlands using McGraw-Hill Create. That micro site will host 29 custom eBooks from our catalog for student purchases. One more observation about using McGraw-Hill Create delivery, is this world, we're not supplying a physical product. That means no printing, no binding cost, no inventory of warehousing cost, no shipping charges, no returns and no used books. Clearly, connecting content and managing digital assets globally is a powerful combination that is creating new opportunities as we shift away from our legacy model to an interactive and digital model.", "The same transition is taking place in professional markets. Here, we're seeing an acceleration in the online ordering of hard copies and a huge increase in the sale of eBooks. Since the beginning of the year, our eBook sales through the major eBook retailers to consumers have nearly tripled. Our best-selling eBooks in the third quarter ranged from the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, to the famous Graham and Dodd's work, Security Analysis. We have more than 5,000 professional titles available as eBooks.", "Even with the continued rapid growth of digital products and services, the fourth quarter this year will be challenging. Last year, we had a significant upswing in operating profits based on the surge in the second quarter semester orders in the U.S. Higher Education market, and improved results in the professional and international markets. The bulk of second semester ordering in Higher Education sometimes occurs in December and in other years, it comes in January, complicating the balancing between the fourth quarter forecasting in this market. The U.S. Higher Education market is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% this year. There is pent-up demand in the el-hi market, but budget pressures are continued to constraint school district spending in many regions. The arrival of new federal funds could positive factor, however. The McGraw-Hill school education group sales teams are still working on a number of large basal adoptions in the open territories, as well as some excellent fourth quarter opportunities for intervention products across the country. Federal funding will clearly play a part in some of these purchases, but in other cases, it will be harder to identify because large district orders tend to be paid for through a blend of funding sources, so it's difficult to predict what will materialize.", "So with that, let sum up our McGraw-Hill Education revenue. We still expect a low single-digit increase, operating margin, we had been forecasting flat margins. We now expect an improvement of 200 basis points to 14% for 2010.", "Okay, let's move over to our review our third segment, and that's the Information & Media segment.  Key contributors to this segment's third quarter performance were the continued solid growth of our Global Energy Information business, an increase in television advertising and the effect of the business we have divestiture. In the third quarter, revenue declined by 4.7%, but excluding business week, it actually grew by 5.1%. Operating profit increased by 55.1% or $16.3 million. The operating margin was 20.1%, up from 12.4% for the same period last year.", "The Business-to-Business Group's revenue declined by 7.1%, but excluding BusinessWeek, increased by 3.3%. In volatile energy markets, the demand for Platts data and information products continues to drive strong growth in both the United States and international markets, and incidentally more than 60% of Platts' revenue comes from outside of the United States.  Platts is growing rapidly across a number of commodities. It is continuing to expand its coverage of the refined petroleum markets in the United States, Europe and Asia, with new price assessments in gasoline, fuel oil, naptha, naptha, being the raw material for gasoline.", "Platts expanded its suite of daily spot price assessments to include alumina, that's a mineral produced from bauxite ore that is used to make aluminum. The new price assessments, the world's first daily price references for alumina address the needs of miners, smelders, refiners and traders for the independent source of open market spot prices to better determine valuations for short and long-term contracts. Platts also began producing new price assessments in the India coal market. India's thermal coal imports are changing trade flows radically, and increasing the need for expanded more frequent and transparent price information. These new assessments address the needs of power producers, coal traders and ship brokers for an independent source of India-related open market spot prices, making Platts even more relevant in this growing market.", "There was some softness in construction, particularly among smaller regional contractors, who have been hardest hit by the declining activity in this market. Weakness in the global Automotive business offset improvements in the non-auto parts of the market at J.D. Power and Associates. Revenue for the Broadcasting Group increased by 23.5% to $23.6 million. The combination of political advertising and improved local and national time sales accounted for the increase. In this political season, the contest for governor and heated race rates for a Senate seat and issue related advertising in Colorado are attracting significant ad dollars.", "Therefore, summing up for Information & Media, there is no change in our revenue guidance. We still expect the revenue decline in the mid-single digits, but mid-single-digit growth excluding BusinessWeek. We now expect the operating margin in the mid to high teens. we Had anticipated an operating margin in the mid-teens, and now we're addressing that upwards a little.", "That concludes our review of the operations and therefore, summing up for the corporation. We anticipate earnings per share in the $2.60 to $2.65 range, and expect to achieve the high end of that range. The new guidance excludes $0.02 of the onetime gains from divestitures, but includes dilution of $0.02 from acquisitions. Okay, let's hold it there and with that, let me turn it over to Bob Bahash, our Chief Financial Officer, for his results.", "Robert Bahash", "Okay, thank you, Terry. It's been an active and productive the third quarter. So this morning, I'm going to focus on strategic acquisitions, divestitures, share buybacks, improved outlook for cash flow and expenses. Now we recently announced three acquisitions: the Research and Estimates Business of TheMarkets.com for Capital IQ; Tegrity, which becomes part of the McGraw-Hill Higher Education Professional and International Group; and PIPAL Research by CRISIL. The acquisition of Tegrity closed in October and Pipal Research is expected to close in the fourth quarter.", "We expect to spend approximately $360 million on these acquisitions and a recent equity investment in Ambow Education, a leading provider of educational and career enhancement services in China. The most significant of these acquisitions, of course, is TheMarkets.com, of diluted earnings per share by $0.01 in the third quarter, and will do so again in the fourth quarter. In 2011, TheMarkets.com acquisition is expected to generate approximately $60 million in revenue and despite an anticipated $15 million in intangible amortization, the acquisition will be both accounting and cash flow accretive in 2011. We also had three divestitures in the third quarter, a small secondary school business in Australia, which generated a $3.8 million pretax gain and two by CRISIL. They are a 7% equity interest in the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange of India. We continue to maintain a 5% ownership, the divestiture of the 7% was required to comply with local regulations regarding foreign ownership rules. And also, CRISIL's remaining 10% interest in Gas Strategies Group, the 90% interest we had sold that back in December of 2008.", "The two CRISIL divestitures this year generated $7.3 million in pretax gains. Now because CRISIL is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary, part of the gain is deductive for purposes of calculating EPS, and is shown as a component of net income attributable to non-controlling interest. This was $2.3 million, which represents the post-tax portion of the gain attributable to the minority owners of CRISIL. In addition to the acquisitions, we continued to actively repurchased shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total cost of $69 million at an average price of $31.14 per share.", "Year-to-date, we are purchased 8.7 million shares for $255.8 million, averaging $29.37 per share. 8.4 million shares remained in the 2007 program authorized by the board.  Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 309.3 million in the third quarter, a 4.4 million decrease versus the previous year due primarily to the full year impact of the second quarter share repurchases. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined 3.9 million for the second quarter, reflecting the full impact of second quarter share repurchases, as well as the weighted impact of third quarter share repurchases. Fully diluted shares at the end of the quarter were approximately 308 million.", "We continued to be well capitalized with net cash and short-term investments as of September 30 of $158 million. The shift to a net cash position from a net debt position of $53 million at the end of the second quarter is driven primarily by strong free cash flow, partially offset by funding for acquisitions and share purchases. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.356 billion, while gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in senior notes. Our debt is entirely in long term unsecured senior notes, no commercial paper is outstanding.", "The outlook for free cash flow continues to improve. Now to calculate free cash flow, we start with our after-tax cash from operations and deduct working, investments and dividends. What's left is free cash flow, funds we can use to repurchase stock, make acquisitions or pay down debt. During the third quarter, our seasonally strongest quarter, we generated free cash flow of $552 million. Year-to-date in 2010, we generated free cash flow of $651 million versus $507 million in the same period last year for an increase of $144 million. The improvement is due primarily to stronger operating results and a continuing focus on asset management. We now expect free cash flow this year to be clearly in excess of $700 million versus our previous guidance of $600 million to $650 million. The improvement is driven by stronger operating results, reduced capital investment projections and more favorable working capital than previously anticipated.  Just as a reminder, free cash flow last year was $770 million.", "Regarding our U.S. pension plan, we made a $14 million discretionary contribution in the third quarter, and we anticipate making an additional discretionary payment in the fourth quarter, potentially in the range of $50 million, and that is factored into the free cash flow projections.", "Now let's look at expenses. As a reminder, I'll", "Speak to adjusted expense growth, which represents expense growth, excluding 2009 restructuring charges, as well as 2009 and 2010 gains and losses on divestitures.  So let's start with Education. Third quarter adjusted expenses were roughly flat, declining 0.1%. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses declined 1.3%. Contributing to the lower expense levels were two key decisions last year. The first was to combine the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations. The second was the planned phaseout of statewide low-margin custom test contracts in California, Florida and Arizona. A $15 million decline in amortization of prepublication cost also benefited third quarter results. Increases in selling and marketing cost for the robust state new adoption opportunities and continued digital investments partially offset these savings. As Terry has indicated, we now expect margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guidance of flat margins.", "For Financial Services, adjusted expenses increased 13.3% in the third quarter and 12.8% at constant currencies. Year-to-date, adjusted expenses increased 10.1% and 9.3% at constant currencies. The growth in expenses in the third quarter and year-to-date was driven by increased salaries and occupancy cost, primarily for international hires and higher incentive compensation.", "Third quarter expenses were also impacted by TheMarkets.com acquisition, that resulted in an incremental $5 million in expense. There also was $5.4 million in additional cost related to our regulatory and compliance initiatives. Now taken together, these increased total Financial Services expense by 2.7%. The fourth quarter is expected to show a comparable increase in cost related to our regulatory and compliance efforts. We're still projecting additional full year cost of approximately $15 million, as Terry stated.", "One last comment on Financial Services. Third quarter expense growth in the beginning of the year, I indicated that total stock-based compensation for McGraw-Hill was expected to increase roughly $30 million versus 2009, due to the three-year earning and vesting period, which is off a depressed base. Due to stronger operating results, we now expect an increase of roughly $40 million. The majority of this increase as anticipated was realized in the third quarter due to particularly depressed levels in the third quarter 2009. As a result, Financial Services had a $10.6 million increase in stock-based compensation for the quarter.", "As Terry indicated , we now expect Financial Services margins to decline by approximately 150 basis points, which implies expenses will increased roughly 9% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 7% to 8%, and increases largely driven by TheMarkets.com acquisition.", "At Information & Media, third quarter and year-to-date adjusted expenses declined 13.1% and 17.4%, respectively. The divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced third quarter revenue by $22 million and expenses by $32 million for a positive profit impact of roughly $10 million for the quarter. Year-to-date, the divestiture of BusinessWeek reduced revenue by $78 million and expenses by $111 million for a positive profit impact of $33 million. And of course, for the fourth quarter, the divestiture of BusinessWeek is expected to reduce revenue by $22 million and expense by $27 million. The positive impact here is $5 million. This will result in full year savings of $38 million.", "For 2010, we expect adjusted expenses to decline in the mid-teens versus our previous guidance of the decline in the low teens. Corporate expenses in the third quarter is $44.4 million, a $16.5 million increase versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation compared to lower levels in 2009, as well as normal increases due to the stronger operating results. Increased excess vacant space was also a contributor to increased corporate costs.", "We are making progress in reducing excess space. We finalized one agreement to sublease some excess space in New York this month and have received several promising inquiries regarding additional space. Because we are subleasing the space at lower rates than what we are currently paying, the accounting rules require us to take a one-time charge for the difference between the present value of the payments we will receive versus the payments we will have to make over the term of the lease. Our new earnings per share guidance excludes this one-time charge, since we are still finalizing accounting for this charge.", "Now excluding the charge, we now expect full year 2010 corporate expense to increased $30 million to $35 million versus our previous guidance of an increase of $25 million to $30 million due to additional incentive compensation accruals. Net interest expense was $19.3 million in the third quarter compared to about $18 million in the same period last year and $21 million in the second quarter of 2010.  We continue to expect full year interest to be roughly comparable to 2009, which was roughly $76.9 million. The company's effective tax rate in the third quarter and year-to-date was 36.4%, which is unchanged from 2009. We expect a comparable rate for the full year.", "Now let's turn to investments.  The publication investments were $39.3 million in the third quarter, $5.4 million lower than last year. Year-to-date, pre-pub investments were $99.3 million, a $30.4 million decrease versus the prior year. For the year, we now expect pre-pub investments of approximately $160 million, and that's versus our previous estimate of the $195 million to $205 million.", "Now the reduction in our pre-pub investment estimate is due to several factors. First, the timing of the adoption of Common Core Standards by various states. To date, 36 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards for K-12 math, reading and language arts. Also, we continued to reevaluate several programs to enhance our digital offerings. These actions have caused timing delays for a number of our pre-pub investments. In addition, we continue to realize savings from combining the core basal publishing operations with our alternative basal and supplemental publishing operations.", "Now purchases of prop and equipment were $16.6 million the third quarter, about $1 million higher than last year. And year-to-date purchases were approximately $39 million. We now expect on a full-year basis the expenditures to be in the $70 million to $80 million range versus our previous estimate of $90 million to $100 million. This compares to $68.5 million in 2009.", "Now let's take a look at some of non-cash items. Amortization of prepublication costs was $112 million in the third quarter, a $15 million decrease versus the third quarter of 2009. For the full year, we now expect $245 million to $250 million versus the previous estimate of $260 million to $265 million. This compares to $270 million in 2009. The decrease reflects the recent lower level of investments.", "Depreciation was $25 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million last year. We now expect full year depreciation to be slightly below last year, which was $113 million. Amortization of intangibles was $9 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $32 million for the first nine months. Reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions, we now expect it to be closer to $50 million for the full year versus our previous estimate of $40 million. Our unearned revenue continues to grow. We ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, up 4.2% for the prior year. At constant foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, growth was approximately 5%. Financial Services represented 74% of the corporation's total unearned revenue. It grew in the low single digits, driven by strong growth in ratings-related information products, S&P Indices and Capital IQ. While still small, unearned revenue at McGraw-Hill Education is showing strong growth due to sales of digital products. For 2010, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth in unearned revenue. Thank you, and now back to Terry.", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you. This is Don Rubin again, and just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Shipman, Jefferies.", "Brian Shipman - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "First on Education, I was wondering if you could take a stab at sizing the 2011 new adoption market for us. And then second, on the S&P business, you saw the new issuance pick up late in Q3. The comparisons are very tough in the fourth quarter, having grown 63% in the year-ago quarter, so can transaction revenue continue to accelerate here from the third quarter trends into the fourth quarter of 2010, or will growth be tough to attain here in the coming fourth quarter?", "Harold McGraw", "First of all, it's a little early to be focusing on 2011. We clearly, obviously, look at the schedule very hard. The calendar is very full. It's going to be a science year next year. And so, if you look at the calendar and just take it from that standpoint, our guesstimate at this point is that we will be at or a little better than 2010 state adoption levels on that one. But we've got to also see what the effect of Common Core Standards are going to be, and if there's going to be changes from that standpoint. So it's a little bit early, but if you look just at the calendar, at or above 2010 is what we're thinking on that one. New issuance, Brian, as you know, coming off of a softer second quarter, we really ramped up, especially the high yield markets. And again, the big number that we watch is the refinancing numbers out through 2014, still it's about $2 trillion in terms of maturities coming due on that part. And of course, there was a lot of refinancing or refundings in the third quarter, a lot of the new issuance that way. We've seen a continued strong corporate market in here. Issuance, a little softer in Europe, but again, one would think that it should be still fairly strong, and we have evidence of that at this point. We'll have to see as we get into November and early December, but so far, it's been pretty good.", "Brian Shipman - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "A quick follow-up, if I may, are you seeing any sign of federal money affecting the el-hi market at all?", "Harold McGraw", "In the el-hi market, yes, you've seen some on that one. It's hard to, as we're saying, it's hard to trace. Funding is coming from various levels but from what we are hearing, for both ends, both at the stateside and the federal level, both are talking about funds coming into the market.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "So terry, the margins of S&P, obviously, is down a little bit year-to-year even in the context of the better revenues. Can you explain where the incremental cost are coming from? But I'm wondering over the next couple of years, how do you think about the potential for margin improvement in the context of a fairly robust debt market? Do you think margins are, at best, flat from here going forward?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, as you know, and I'll get Bob to get on this, we reported 39.2% and then when you take out the gains, it gets down to 38.1%. And then if in between -- what is it Bob, between foreign change?", "Robert Bahash", "Yes, if you adjust for the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in the quarter, as well as the impact of the one-month worth of TheMarkets.com, the apples-to-apples margin would be 39.6%.", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, and that gets us back to the 40% range. And I think what we're going to see, especially in terms of some of the QCCR compliance network cost, we're going to start to see that abate. And the hope would be then that we would be able to translate that into margin improvement on that part. So we're pleased with where we are relative to the cost associated, but we'll be looking for margin improvement.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Do you think low to mid-forties is reasonable expectation for the next several years?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, again, I mean, there's a lot of uncertainties and what the pipeline would be like and what any additional regulatory issues and compliance cost and all of that. That would certainly be the hope, Peter. But I think we just better take it as it comes right now, just so that we want to keep expectations to where they are.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "One last thing, Terry, on the margins front, in the Education segment, obviously, doing quite a bit than you expected this year with the leverage from the revenue upside, how do you think about the sustainability of margins of Education going into '11 in the context of what presumably will be a tougher year from a revenue standpoint?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, I mean, again, I think one of the questions is, we want to take a good hard look at the student aid, the federal government student aid program. That clearly has helped Enrollments, and that's why we made adjustment from Higher Ed grew from 5% to 7%, up to 8% to 10%. It's really going to trigger on enrollments there and if enrollments stay strong, then I think we will continue to benefit from that. And therefore, margins will be reflective of that.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "In the K-12 business, you think it's sustainable margin wise in the context of how you see revenues pointing out?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, again, I think we've got to see what the impact of Common Core Standards are going to be on that part. And my opinion between that and digital, it can only help.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber, Access 342.", "Craig Huber - ", "We'll just stick with Education precisely if I could. What percentage of your elementary-highschool revenues comes from digital, and also what's percent of your college revenues are from digital, I guess, for the first nine months?", "Harold McGraw", "Craig, at this point, on the Higher Ed Professional side, we're seeing 15% and growing very rapidly. So we're pleased with that. On the elementary-high school side, it's smaller than that. We're benefiting at the Higher Ed side with McGraw-Hill Connect now, and all of the related pieces to that. But we don't break that out as such, but it would be a smaller number than the 15%", "Craig Huber - ", "If it's like ballpark of around 5%, would that be reasonable, you think?", "Harold McGraw", "I would say it's somewhere probably a little higher than that, but probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 6% to 8%.", "Craig Huber - ", "Can you size for us in the U.S., I guess, this year, the open territories in residual sales? What percent, I guess, declined most likely this year, are you expecting that for the whole market?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, again, the open territory market has been problematic, really, for the last four years, and we are looking in to see more progress in that area. That will be a big piece of future growth. That's roughly 45% of the whole opportunity on that part. But at this point, we still see it as a hold back.", "Robert Bahash", "Our current thinking in terms of where we are and how we factor into our outlook for the full year for all of K-12 is that for residual sales, we're looking at a decline on a full-year basis in the high-single digits and for open territory declines and more of mid-single digits maybe 3% to 5%, with declines in both areas.", "Craig Huber - ", "Could you help us understand better the opportunity here on the digital front as you migrate away from print? What on average, the printing cost, binding cost, warehousing cost, postage cost, what percent of cash cost is that for your print operations in Education you end saving as things transition over to digital?", "Robert Bahash", "It's about 25%.", "Craig Huber - ", "Can you just talk a bit further about, I guess, the backlog here for your Ratings business for the fourth quarter? What material changes are you seeing there versus the trends you saw here in the third quarter?", "Harold McGraw", "Craig, right now, so as we were saying, especially in terms of corporate governance in that category, we're starting to see still strong transaction growth, a little bit less in Europe on that part. But so far, it's looking promising. We'll be watching it together in all of that, but from a pipeline standpoint, it's looking good right now. And again, the bigger number is the $2 trillion worth of refinancings that have to take place between now and 2014. And that should keep some pretty good activity in that part of the market.", "Robert Bahash", "Craig, let me just expand on your previous question. The paper print buying postage elements, of course, are variable cost. So if you elect not to print a product and you move to a digital offering, those costs go away. But you also mentioned warehousing, of course, that's not a variable cost. You're still going to be in an avenue where we're going to be producing product for a period of time, maybe our warehousing structure over time could be reduced, but that's clearly not a variable cost in the short-term.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Michael Meltz, JPMC.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "The 2011 Education question was asked a few different ways. Let me try it another way here. At this point, do you think you can grow your total Education segment revenues in '11 just with K-12 trends, as well as what's happening on the Higher Ed side with the for-profit guys?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, well, Mike, it's a little bit early to be forecasting that. I think that what we've done is we've taken a look at where we are in terms of what we're going to be submitting, and we've taken a look at the calendar and just have done some rough estimating, and that's why we say at or above 2010 levels in all these. But I don't want to mislead, and we have to see what Common Core Standards are going to do. And so it's a little premature to come in with a harder number.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On the college side, what about the potential  headwind for profit or that portion of the market?", "Harold McGraw", "Enrollments. The number we're watching there is clearly enrollments. And as we said, the student aid program has been very robust and very helpful to that part of it, and that's why we've increased our projections on that. That's the number we're going to be looking at. And then if we have a decent enrollment number, you can anticipate a commensurate year.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On the liability side at S&P, we've seen that, that recent ruling is another nice win for you, that Rice ruling you mentioned. There's been some talk in the trade pubs recently about S&P losing some mandates versus Moody's and Fitch, perhaps, because of tougher stance on liability provisions in documents. Can you talk a little bit about that please?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, I mean, I think it depends on the area and the like. That's why in the QCCR area, we breakout both the quality assurance aspect, the criteria, the compliance and the risk areas on that part. And we managed the criteria side very hard on that one, making sure that it is as strong, as solid and is appropriate to any particular issue. If there is a particular area, where our criteria is a little tougher or a little more stringent than somebody else, I think it balances out in through the number of issues, but there could be some in that way on that part. But we also are saying very clearly to any issuer that if you were supplying us with information that is going to go into a part of the determination of a rating, then, A, you have to be accountable to make sure that the data and information that you're providing us is reliable and all of that. Now we're going to test in all of those kinds of things. But again, all we're saying is that, you've got to be very accountable that the information that you're giving us that's going to help determine a credit rating is reliable. That's what we're saying.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "In terms of free cash flow priorities, you did the TheMarkets.com acquisition, which is, well not all that big, one of your biggest in a couple of years. Can you talk about your priority in terms of M&A versus your repurchase, please?", "Harold McGraw", "Both are very viable in all of that. In fact, also in terms of organic growth, a lot of the digital components like McGraw-Hill Create and Connect and those kinds of things, those are very strong organic programs, and you can count on the fact that of the four uses, dividend, share repurchase, organic and acquisition, all are active and continuing. Now again, when you go through the latter part of 2008 and into 2009, activity levels in terms of acquisitions and some of those projects were softer in all of that. And obviously, the focus then was on share repurchase and dividend in all of that. Now given the strength of the free cash flow and improved markets and the like, you can see activity in all four areas.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Arthur, Evercore.", "Douglas Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Yes, Terry, you might have answered because I get distracted for a second. But the 4.3% increase in Higher Ed, Professional and International, that seems light to me in light of your dominance, your strength in college and the fact that you raised the basis for the industry. So what were the offsets there?", "Harold McGraw", "International. The international side was a little softer than we had anticipated. But the Higher Ed side, in particular, it's clearly going to come in, in terms of -- or in line with our expectations and maybe even better on that part. But it was the international side that was the softer.", "Douglas Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc.", "And in terms of the market growth of 8% to 10%, are you going to meet share or gain share?", "Harold McGraw", "We'll see. Well, at the very least, we'll meet share. And hopefully, we'd do a little better. But at this point, I think it's safe to say we'll meet.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Edward Atorino, Benchmark.", "Edward Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "I have the same question Doug did on the Higher Ed. One other one, Terry, given what I thought was a surprisingly school growth with all of the budgetary best pressures and et cetera, books sort of, I don't want to say immune, but they're pretty small slice of the budget, and it seems they're holding their own in a very difficult environment. Would you discuss, are the cuts not hitting the book area?", "Harold McGraw", "No, I think that again, you still have pent-up demand. Remember, when we talk about the state adoption market, it was half or a little more than half of what it was last year. And so the increase of 65%, 75% in the state new adoption market and also, some of the growth in the intervention market, I think it has been a little bit of a surprise and has held up. Even though at one point, we were thinking 875 to 925 for the state new adoption market, in the second quarter, we came back to 825, 875. And I think that's going to a pretty a good range for this year, and we clearly are benefiting from that.", "Operator", "That does conclude this morning's call.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies. Sir, you may begin.", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you, and good morning to our global audience and thank you, everyone, for joining us for The McGraw-Hill Companies Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. I'm Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations at The McGraw-Hill Companies. With me today are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jack Callahan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter results. We trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and the financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted earnings per share, operating profit and corporate expense information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management's.

Today's update will last approximately an hour. After the presentations, we will open the meeting to questions and answers.", "It's now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Harold McGraw", "Okay. Thank you very much, Don, and good morning, everybody, and again, welcome to our conference call. With me today is Jack Callahan, our new financial officer. He joined the company in early December, and we're obviously so pleased to have him onboard.", "This morning, we will be reviewing the fourth quarter 2010 earnings and prospects for The McGraw-Hill Companies in 2011. Following my presentation, Jack will review our financials. And after our presentation, we will obviously be pleased to answer any questions, to take any comments that you have about The McGraw-Hill Companies.", "Earlier this morning, we were pleased to announce fourth quarter 2010 results and provide guidance on another year of growth, earnings growth in 2011. 2010 was a very good year. Briefly, recapping our 2010 results, we reported fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.50 and $2.65 for the year. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter earnings grew by 7.8% to $0.55 compared to $0.51 last year and by 13.5% to $2.69 for the full year. There was dilution from acquisitions of $0.01 in the fourth quarter and $0.02 for the full year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, revenue in 2010 increased by 5.3%. And that took it up to $6.2 billion.", "To speed the flow of information and increase transparency for the investment community, we added several new exhibits to the fourth quarter earnings release including a consolidated balance sheet and cash flow statements. To reflect the previously announced realignment of financial services, we also provided quarterly 2009 and 2010 recasted revenue and operating profit for our new segments, McGraw-Hill Financial and Standard & Poor's.", "Starting with our 2010 Form 10-K, we will begin reporting our results in four segments. That would be Standard & Poor's, for the credit rating side; McGraw-Hill Financial; McGraw-Hill Education; and McGraw-Hill Information & Media. This chart illustrates the recasted  revenue and operating profit contributions of each of the four segments in 2010. By forming McGraw-Hill Financial as a four-segment, we have created a billion-dollar-plus business that recasted, produced 19% of our 2010 revenue and 20% of our adjusted segment operating profit. The establishment of McGraw-Hill Financial, under the leadership of Lou Eccleston, is the realization of a strategic concept that we began testing in 2008 with the creation of firms, the fixed income and risk management group within the S&P Investment Services. We wanted to leverage our intellectual property and create new opportunities for growth by deploying a horizontal management structure across vertical businesses to integrate core capabilities.", "By creating the new segment, we have brought together a powerful portfolio of assets that were previously managed vertically, but strong and successful business lines. Now by acting with a coordinated, collaborative and the integrated model, these assets are the foundation of a business that can be greater than the sum of the parts. We will drive organic growth through the development of new, integrated solutions from our proprietary assets and build new, innovative and differentiated solutions for clients to manage investments as well as trading strategies.", "With the new ability to deliver a broad and deep suite of products for investors across asset classes, McGraw-Hill Financial is positioned to capitalize on growth trends in global markets for financial information, data and analytics. Capabilities are key to the new segment. With core capabilities, McGraw-Hill Financial will leverage content, data sets, analytics and technology in a coordinated framework from launching new products and services.", "To help realize the strategic concept, Lou Eccleston reorganized the products and services from S&P Investment Services into four units, and integrated the fixed income and risk management operation into the new organization. The units representing the new integrated product capabilities are the following: One, enterprise solutions; two, benchmarks; three, research and analytics; and four, integrated desktop solutions.", "In this chart, you can see how products and services are now aligned in the McGraw-Hill Financial segment. First, enterprise solutions is all about leveraging data, comprehensive access and efficient delivery of critical content. Through enterprise solutions, clients will be able to access efficiently all of McGraw-Hill Financial and Standard & Poor's data and a broad range of third-party content. ", "Secondly, S&P Indices are the key to benchmarks. Our liquid, investable indices give investors the benchmarks to measure markets objectively and transparently for a growing range of asset classes. Third, research and analytics leverages proprietary data set, cross-asset class analytics, commentary, research and technology to develop market analysis and investment insight for institutional and private wealth management clients. And finally, integrated workflow tools will enable integrated desktop solutions to create packages of comprehensive, fundamental and quantitative research and analysis for investment managers, banks, private equity funds, credit professionals, advisory firms, corporations and universities worldwide.", "In this new configuration, McGraw-Hill Financial is a $1.2-plus-billion business at the end of 2010, with an operating margin of 26.5%. That compares to revenue of $918 million in 2010 for Standard & Poor's Investment Services. The biggest swing factor is the inclusion in the new segment of the Securities Information business from S&P Credit Market Services, and that would be S&P RatingsDirect and S&P RatingsXpress.", "McGraw-Hill Financial is predominantly a subscription business. Revenues from subscriptions produced about 74% of 2010 revenue. About 70% of revenue came from domestic sources in 2010 with international revenue growing at a double-digit rate last year as S&P Indices and Capital IQ continue to expand successfully in foreign markets. As recasted, McGraw-Hill Financial turned in its best performance in 2010 in the fourth quarter. Including $12.7 million in the fourth quarter revenue from the acquisition of Markets.com, revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 12.4% to $321.8 million compared to 2009.", "Growth in the number of exchange-traded funds combined with a recovery in global equity markets produced a 21.6% increase in the fourth quarter in assets under management linked to S&P Indices. There was $300.3 billion under management at the end of 2010, and these would be exchange-traded funds based on the S&P Indices.", "In 2010, the number of exchange-traded funds based on S&P Indices increased by 95 to 301. It is a record to build on, and you can expect more new index products in 2011. ", "Capital IQ experienced significant client growth, finishing 2010 with more than 3,400 customers and that's an increase of 15.8% for the year. ", "The integration of TheMarkets.com continues smoothly. It will be a strong addition to our integrated desktop platform for this year.", "So let's sum up for McGraw-Hill Financial. With momentum building at the end of 2010 and promising market conditions in 2011, we believe McGraw-Hill Financial should get off to a good start this year. Our expectations, strong organic growth and the acquisition of Markets.com should produce low double-digit revenue and operating profit growth in 2011.", "Now let's review the performance of Standard & Poor's, our Ratings business, in the new four-segment alignment. Standard & Poor's had a solid year and a strong finish to 2010. Recasted revenue grew by 13.4% in the fourth quarter and operating profit increased by 14.3%. Revenue for 2010 increased by 10.3% to $1.7 billion, and adjusted operating profit grew by 6.5% to $755.1 million. The adjusted operating margin was 44.5%, down 160 basis points from 2009.", "S&P has seen the strongest activity in key market since 2007, as worldwide corporate high-yield new dollar volume and U.S. public finance issuance set new records in 2010. The previous annual and quarterly records for worldwide high-yield dollar volume issuance was set in 2007, but 2010 easily topped them. Issuance of $381.4 billion in 2010 compares to $243.5 billion in 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2010, there was $120.5 billion of worldwide high-yield issuance compared to the previous quarterly record of $106 billion in the second quarter of 2007.", "The need for refinancing. The need for refinancing, tightening spreads and investors' appetite for yield spurred activity in the speculative-grade market. As this table shows, S&P's high-yield composite spread, obviously the excess interest rate over treasury bond, has been tightening since July and closed the year at 540 basis points. The investment-grade composite spread also gradually tightened since July and ended 2010 at 178 basis points.", "U.S. high-yield issuance in 2010 was driven by refinancing, as companies took advantage of low rate to replace existing bonds with cheaper debt. According to a report from Standard & Poor's, called Leveraged Commentary & Data, refinancing accounted for 64% of U.S. high-yield volume. Bank loan ratings, primarily to extend maturities, also soared in the fourth quarter. With the popular Build America Bond program expiring at the end of 2010, U.S. public finance dollar volume posted all-time record dollar volume issuance for our fourth quarter. It also was a record year for the U.S. public finance issuance. The $486.7 billion dollar volume issuance in 2010 topped the previous record set in 2007 by $18.3 billion.", "The structured finance market is still struggling both here in the United States and in Europe. All things considered, we like our prospects in 2011. We expect to benefit from the same trends that contributed to Standard & Poor's success in 2010. The year is off to a very good start, and corporate issuance, including high-yield bonds, looks strong again.", "There are several reasons why we think 2011 will be another very good year for ratings. It starts with refinancing. Refinancing requirements are substantial and will contribute to a healthy new issuance pipeline. Between 2011 and 2014, S&P estimates there are $5.6 trillion in bond and loan maturities coming due for the U.S. and European markets. Although some of the 2011 maturities have already been refinanced, S&P estimate the maturities in the range of $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion per year between 2011 and 2014.", "Access to capital markets remains strong and financing costs are still low. Tighter spreads will allow for needed refinancing requirements. Fundamentals are supportive. Credit investors expect default rates to remain low in 2% to 3% range, and U.S. gross domestic product to grow between 2.5% and 3% in 2011. Confidence of issuers and investors is improving. Companies are generating cash and are more confident about initiating expansion activities. The investors' search for yield will persist. In 2010, S&P saw increased weighting of higher yielding and higher risk bonds in some portfolios. In North America, deals were oversubscribed for companies rated B- and sometimes even lower.", "Merger and acquisition activity, our key driver to new bond issuance, is growing. Continued deleveraging by banks will also contribute to the growth of public debt markets. Some of the trends driving activity in the United States markets in 2011 will also contribute to international growth. We anticipated improved results in 2011 from most of our regions.", "We look for a modest growth in the U.S. public finance sector after record issuance in 2010. S&P expects the current economic and budget climate should result in more borrowing this year by state and local governments in the face of added pension costs and the toll of tax revenues. In the structured finance market, we expect slow recovery in both the U.S. and in international markets. The outlook for the leveraged loan market is excellent, as banks resume lending and investors' appetite for the paper is high.", "Now let's shift for a moment and let me spend a moment just reviewing a number of the issues that we're dealing with. And let me begin with a synopsis of our legal situation. We start the year with 16 of our motions to dismiss granted in their entirety. Seven more lawsuits have been voluntarily withdrawn. Four of the dismissed case involved fraud charges. Clearly, we are making progress in the three broad categories that we used to keep investors up-to-date on the litigation situation involving Standard & Poor's and the corporation.", "Let me go through them. First, in our first category are the underwriter claims based on the Securities Act of 1933. Here, the plaintiffs have alleged that Standard & Poor's is liable as an underwriter or seller of securities. To date, 12 of our motions to dismiss claims under the 33 Act have been granted. Three of these dismissed claims have been appealed. On January 11, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard arguments on the plaintiffs' appeal of the earlier dismissals.", "In the second category, there are cases brought by purchasers of our stock. They alleged that the company's statements about its Earnings and Ratings business were misleading and violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the recent. In three of the four cases in this category, our motions to dismiss have been granted. The plaintiffs appealed two of those decisions and are waiting for decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for those outcome. In the remaining case, we are waiting for a decision on our motion to dismiss.", "In the third category, these are lawsuits asserting a variety of state law claims including fraud. Included here is the Rice litigation in which a federal court in California last October granted our motion to dismiss, with prejudice, a plaintiff's claims of negligence, intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation. The court also acknowledged that ratings are opinions about the future and therefore, not actionable unless plaintiffs can demonstrate that a rating agency did not believe the ratings to be true when they issued them. ", "In addition to these three categories, there are some lawsuits overseas. They are in very preliminary stages and some involve jurisdictional issues. The most notable at this time is the Parmalat litigation which got started in Italy in the fall of 2005. In a procedural hearing on January 11, the judge ordered final briefs to be submitted in March. We continue to believe that the outcome of this litigation against two subsidiaries of The McGraw-Hill Companies should not have a material effect on our financial condition.", "In recent weeks, we have seen favorable decisions by the state courts in Pennsylvania and California. A state court in Pennsylvania dismissed negligence claims and narrowly circumscribed a fraud claim in four related cases brought by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. By narrowing the fraud claim, the state court established a very high standard for the plaintiffs. To prove that fraud occurred, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs must show that the credit rating agencies did not \"truly believe that credit quality of the mortgage pool underlying each certificate, plus credit enhancement, if any, was sufficient to support its AAA ratings at the time the ratings were assigned.\" Our legal team does not believe that the Federal Home Loan Bank can meet this high standard.", "In another case in California brought against Standard & Poor's and the others, CalPERS has alleged negligent misrepresentation in connection with the ratings of three specific SIVs. In December, a California state court granted our motion that the complaint falls under a California statute protecting speech made in the public interest. The decision in California shifts the burden in the case to CalPERS which now must demonstrate with the probability of success that it can prove its claim. It is difficult to estimate when to expect more court rulings. Obviously, the courts have the on discretion when they will act on the lawsuits before them. But we believe the decisions that have already been rendered by the courts constitute meaningful precedent, which should help guide rulings on pending cases. In important ways, these rulings recognized limitations facing plaintiffs who seek to assert legal claims against S&P ratings. And that's why our overall assessment of legal risk in the various lawsuits remains very low.", "We're also prepared to operate in the new regulatory environment, that's why Standard & Poor's has made significant investments in technology platforms and staffing and created what we call the QCCR governance and control framework. That QCCR stands for Quality, Criteria, Compliance and Risk. And each of those four groups operate independently of the Ratings business. We invested approximately $80 million in the QCCR framework in 2010, that's on top of $63 million in 2009, to meet new regulatory requirements. There may be an estimated $12 million to $15 million incremental increase in investments in 2011.", "In the U.S., we expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to engage in more rulemaking in 2011 and that's obviously to meet the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. We also expect there will also be some new regulations from Canada and Singapore. New regulations have already been passed in Hong Kong and Taiwan.", "In January, the European Securities and Market Authority or ESMA was launched to oversee rating agencies in the European Union and to exercise other oversight powers. ESMA is now stepping up, and we welcome the move to a more centralized approach to regulation in the European Union, a harmonization process is very much necessary needed.", "Even as the new regulations in Europe are coming on stream, the European Commission last fall issued a paper soliciting comments on the rating agencies for potential new legislation. Much of this ground has been covered before, and that's reflected in comments that the commission is now receiving. For example, the British Bankers' Association and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe told the commission to proceed with caution, introducing still more mandatory requirements and to allow time for the practical implementation of the recently passed legislation. They also pointed out that the political pressure to reform credit rating agencies, in particular in the sovereign space, is not grounded in any evidence that ratings in Europe have failed to perform according to expectations.", "While we cannot predict when or if new regulations will emerge, we are carefully tracking developments and reviewing the important issues with decision maker. Any new law would require the approval of the European Parliament and the European Union state, a time-consuming process to say the least. We also believe our QCCR framework prepares us to deal effectively with the new and existing regulations in our global marketplace.", "So let me sum up for Standard & Poor's in 2011. The legal risk remains very low. We are prepared to deal effectively with the new regulatory requirements. Continuing strong corporate issuance should produce high single-digit revenue growth. Operating profit should grow in the high single digits in 2011.", "Okay. With that, let me shift now to McGraw-Hill Education. We finished ahead for the year in Education, even though our key markets and our business declined in the seasonally slow fourth quarter. Revenue decreased by 4.6% in the fourth quarter and increased by 1.9% for the year. Operating profit fell by 51.7% in the fourth quarter, but operating profit for the full year grew on an adjusted basis by 25% for the full year 2010.", "The revenue pattern is also reflected in the latest market data. The elementary-high school market finished 2010 with an increase of 3.3% despite a double-digit decline in the fourth quarter, and these are all according to the Association of American Publishers statistics.", "U.S. higher education grew by 6.8% in 2010, but sales fell 3.3% in the fourth quarter as second semester purchasing declined. We are assessing that situation but at the moment, we have more questions on that than answers. Fourth quarter comparisons in 2010 for McGraw-Hill Education were more difficult because of our robust performance in the fourth quarter of 2009, and that was in both el-hi and higher education market. As we had anticipated, a strong state new adoption market was key to our performance and to the el-hi market's growth in 2010. We captured about 30% of the state new adoption market, which is estimated at $850 million to $875 million in total and increased market share in 2010.", "The gain by the McGraw-Hill School Education Group in the elementary-high school market was offset by a decline in testing. As a result, revenue for the McGraw-Hill School Education was flat in 2010. The decline in testing occurred primarily because of the planned discontinuation of custom contracts in three states: Arizona, California and Florida. All of these programs produced revenue in 2009. Our award-winning Acuity program, and this is the leader now in formative assessment market, continued to add new clients in 2010. ", "The McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Professional and International Group's revenue declined by 3.3% in the fourth quarter but increased 3.8% for the year. In the U.S., higher education market, where enrollments increased again in 2010, we saw growth in all four of our major imprints as well as double-digit gains for our digital products and services. However, we did not match the industry's overall growth rate. ", "In 2011, our position in the marketplace will be enhanced by our steadily expanding array of digital products and services and also by our new alliance with Blackboard, the nation's leading Web-based learning and management system. Through this alliance, we will be the only publisher to have a homework management product, McGraw-Hill Connect; and a custom publishing system, McGraw-Hill Create; integrated seamlessly into the Blackboard platform. As a result, we expect to increase the usage of McGraw-Hill Connect within Blackboard's large institutional imprint. Blackboard currently services approximately 80% of U.S. colleges and universities.", "In professional markets, too, we saw double-digit growth for digital products and services that make up increasing share of our product mix. The great majority of our new print publications are also released as eBooks and as a result of this policy, we ended 2010 with a list of more than 6,000 titles that can be purchased electronically. More than 130 mobile phone applications were also available for download. By the end of the year, more to come.", "Along with eBooks, our online resources in science, medicine, engineering contributed to our digital growth in professional markets. In 2011, expect expansion of our online subscription products, expansion in our eBook offerings, mobile applications and other digital services. Digital developments will increase our opportunity in international markets. The latest example is the recent announcement that we are joining with Wipro in India to launch a mobile learning platform called mConnect. This initiative combines McGraw-Hill's digital learning and adaptive educational software with Wipro's wireless technology capabilities to deliver supplemental educational services by cellphone to students and workers and those seeking to increase their job skills. ", "Incidentally, with 5.3 billion cell phones estimated in the world, there are 700 million cell phones in India at this point. By the end of next year in India, one in five, 20% of all cell phones will be there. By the way, just to take that a step further, China currently has about 800 million cell phones and combined, India and China represent somewhere around 42%, 43% of all the cell phones in the world.", "In the elementary-high school market for 2011, we expect flat to minimal growth, a reflection of the continuing pressures on state and local budgets. Just as in 2010, the swing factor will be the strength of the state new adoption market. By some estimates, the state new adoption market in 2011 could be the same as 2010 or it could be somewhat larger than it was in 2010. One of the key factors we're watching very carefully is obviously the adoption market in Texas. ", "But the outlook for the state new adoption market in 2011 will depend to a greater extent on just how much Texas decides to spend for the program on this year's adoption list. The State Board of Education in Texas has recommended full funding for all subject categories, but the actual amount will obviously depend on the budget still to be developed and enacted by the Texas Legislature. Concerns over the state's projected deficit could limit funding. As a result, we probably won't be able to size the opportunity in Texas until we get into the second quarter.", "So let's sum up for McGraw-Hill Education. Our market expectations, flat to minimal growth in the elementary-high school market, 4% to 6% growth in the U.S. higher education market. For McGraw-Hill Education in 2011, revenue growth, in the low single digits. Operating profit, a decline is anticipated largely driven by investments, especially for the digital developments. The decrease could range from mid single digits to high single digits.", "And finally, now let's review McGraw-Hill Information & Media. Strong results all year in the global energy markets. Growth in digital revenue and a substantial margin expansion marked the performance of this segment in 2010. Revenue in the fourth quarter decreased by 1.6% and declined by 4.9% for the year. But excluding BusinessWeek revenue, fourth quarter revenue grew by 7.6% and by 6.2% for the full year. ", "Operating profit, including the fourth quarter restructuring charge of $10.6 million, declined by 14.6%, but on an adjusted basis increased by 40.8% for the year. For 2010, operating profit increased by 73.1% and grew by 98.6% on an adjusted basis. In 2010, this segment produced the best operating margin in a decade. More importantly, we believe the new level is sustainable. ", "In 2010, we reported an operating margin of 17.7% compared to 9.7% in 2009. On an adjusted basis, the improvement was more pronounced, 18.8% versus 9% for 2009. The 2010 adjusted margin is the best Information & Media has achieved since 2000 when it hit 21.1%. Obviously, the divestiture of BusinessWeek in 2009 contributed to the improvement, but so did the continuing strength of Platts and the rebound in the Broadcasting Group's performance. Platts produced strong results all year as market demand for its proprietary content grew in the United States as well as in international markets.", "More proprietary content, including 24 new price assessments launched in 2010, will keep Platts moving ahead in 2011. Many of the new price assessments are first in their markets, an indication of Platts' ability to recognize and respond to these trends.", "To add new capabilities in the energy markets, Platts also acquired BENTEK Energy in January and announced the acquisition of OPIS, Oil Price Information Service, which is subject to regulatory approval. BENTEK is a leading provider of fundamental data and analysis for the natural gas market in North America. The OPIS, the Oil Price Information Service, is a leader in news and pricing information for the wholesale and retail petroleum markets in North America.", "Improvements in the domestic auto business contributed to J.D. Power and Associates fourth quarter performance and set the stage for more growth in 2011. Softness in the commercials construction industry still continues to hamper McGraw-Hill Construction activity in 2010, which we're starting to see to pick up. All these brands are part of the Business-to-Business Group, whose revenues declined by 7% in 2010, but grew at 4.9% when you exclude BusinessWeek. The Business-to-Business Group has increasingly a digitally-based subscription business. More than 65% of the revenue in 2010 was digital. We expect that proportion to increase again in 2011.", "Strong political advertising and improvement in national and local time sales at our Broadcasting Group produced a 21.7% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $28.4 million and an 18.3% gain for 2010 to $96 million. ", "Summing up for the Information & Media segment. The outlook for 2011 calls for revenue growth in the mid-single digits, adjusted operating profit growth in the mid-single digits as well.", "Okay. That wraps up our review of the operations. So let me sum up for the outlook for the corporation in 2011. We are very encouraged by our progress in 2010. It was the product and some important decisions and recovery markets that will help set the stage for another year of growth in 2011. We expect to build on our strong 2010 results and the solid finish up both Standard & Poor's and McGraw-Hill Financial. We will also make important investments in digital products and services at McGraw-Hill Education to take us to a new level in a rapidly developing market. Continuing economic recovery and improving trends in financial markets are keys to our guidance for 2011, and that would be a range of $2.79 to $2.89 per diluted share. ", "Okay. With that, let me hold it there, and let me turn it over to our CFO, Jack Callahan. Jack?", "Jack Callahan", "Thank you, Terry, and it's a pleasure to join you today in my first earnings release conference call representing this terrific team at the McGraw-Hill Companies. Terry has reviewed the segment results and guidance, but I do want to provide additional detail on our two new reporting segments, Standard & Poor's and McGraw-Hill Financial. Then, I will focus on corporate and general expense, free cash flow and investment, share buybacks and our strong financial position.", "Let me start with some additional color on Standard & Poor's and McGraw-Hill Financial. McGraw-Hill Financial is being charged a royalty for the right to use and distribute content and data developed by Standard & Poor's. This fee is recognized as non-transaction revenue for Standard & Poor's and as expense for McGraw-Hill Financial. The revenue and expense is then eliminated in consolidation for total McGraw-Hill Company results. The amount for 2010 was approximately $56 million, which we have broken out by quarter on Exhibit 7 of the press release.", "Also, as Terry has indicated, S&P RatingsDirect and S&P RatingsXpress are now part of McGraw-Hill Financial. Previously, these products were reported as part of Credit Market Services' non-transaction revenue. As the result of this, as well as some other more minor movements, you will note that Standard & Poor's revenue is now less than the previous reported Credit Market Services' revenue, and it is modestly more transaction-oriented. For example, in 2010, 61% of Standard & Poor's revenue is non-transaction-related versus 65% for Credit Market Services.", "Now let me turn to some corporate items. Adjusted corporate expense, which excludes the one-time charge of $15.6 million related to subleasing excess space in the company's New York facilities, increased by approximately $10 million to $46.7 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted corporate expense increased approximately $37 million to $164.4 million. This year-on-year increase is largely due to increased incentive compensation as a result of strong 2010 results, especially coming off the depressed base in 2009 and the impact of the increase in vacant space.", "Going forward, we expect this increase in corporate expense to moderate. Currently, we are expecting an increase in the mid single-digit range in 2011. One last point on a number of corporate items. Both interest expense and our effective tax rate are expected to be remained relatively flat in 2011 versus 2010.", "Now let's review free cash flow. As a reminder, to calculate free cash flow, we start with cash provided by operating activities and deduct capital investments and dividends. What is left is free cash flow, funds we can use to make acquisitions, repurchase stock or pay down debt. We finished the year with $881 million in free cash flow. Given those strong results, we made a discretionary payment of $125 million to our U.S. pension plan in December. For 2011, we anticipate making only a relatively minimal contribution to the pension.", "We do expect another year of strong free cash flow in excess of $700 million in 2011 despite an increase in capital investment. Let me discuss the drivers of the step-up in capital investment. Pre-publication investments were approximately $151 million in 2010, in line with previous guidance of approximately $160 million. This level of investment is our lowest ever and reflects the shifting of some investment from 2010 to 2011. We held up some programs in 2010, while the new Common Core State Standards were being finalized and then adopted across the country. To date, 43 states in the District of Columbia have signed on. Even though tests, based on the Common Core State Standards, are not scheduled until the 2014-2015 academic year, many states want to begin transitioning their teachers and students to the new standards beginning next fall. By delaying some publication dates by several months, we could reflect both the existing state standards and the final versions of the Common Core Standards as appropriate to each program in our forthcoming product releases.", "We are also stepping up digital investments as part of these programs. For 2011, we expect prepublication investment to return to a more normalized level. We expect to spend roughly $200 million to $225 million or approximately a $50 million to $75 million increase next year.", "Amortization of prepublication costs was $246 million in 2010. It is expected to decline slightly in 2011 given the reduced level of investment we saw in 2010. ", "Turning to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $115 million in 2010. For 2011, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $150 million driven in part by increased digital and technology-related investments. We continue to return cash to shareholders. In 2010, we returned $548 million through dividends and share repurchases. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter. But for the year, we bought 8.7 million shares for approximately $256 million, averaging $29.37 per share. That leaves 8.4 million shares in the 2007 program as authorized by the Board of Directors.", "We plan to continue to repurchase shares at a measured pace in 2011. We are currently targeting to repurchase approximately half of the 8.4 million shares remaining in 2011, subject to market conditions. The share repurchase has been factored into our EPS guidance, though the impact is expected to be minimal.", "We also recently announced a 6.4% increase in our dividend, our 38th consecutive increase. We are one of fewer than 25 companies in the S&P 500 that can make that statement. In 2011, our annual dividend is now $1 per share. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 310.3 million in the fourth quarter, a 4.2 million decrease versus the prior year due primarily to the 2010 share repurchase program.", "Overall, we continue to be very well capitalized, with net cash and short-term investments at year end of approximately $350 million. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.548 billion, while gross debt comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in senior notes. Our debt is entirely in long-term unsecured senior notes, no commercial paper is outstanding.", "This strong financial position enables us to selectively add attractive, strategically relevant businesses to the McGraw-Hill portfolio. As Terry mentioned earlier, we have already closed the BENTEK acquisition in 2011, and we hope to do the same with the OPIS, Oil Price Information Service transaction in the near term.", "In closing, these last two months at McGraw-Hill have certainly exceeded my admittedly high expectations coming into the organization. The product portfolio is deep, with the potential for future growth. The capabilities and values of the team here are truly impressive. And Bob Bahash has left me a well-oiled finance organization to carry on into the future. ", "With that, thank you for joining us today. I look forward to meeting more of you in the coming months. And now, let me turn the call back over to Terry.", "Harold McGraw", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The question comes from Sloan Bohlen from Goldman Sachs.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "First, Terry, I was wondering if maybe you could start off with speaking to margins within the financial segment, I guess, basically the S&P segment. One, the margins look like they're a little bit weak in the fourth quarter relative to the issuance activity. And then second to that, to what degree you think you guys have pricing power to maybe kind of offset that in 2011?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, again, what's influencing a little bit the margins at S&P have been some of the investments that we've been making all along, especially in the QCCR framework in terms of all the compliance and surveillance systems. And you have, for 2010, $80 million in that number. And then probably see another $12 million to $15 million incrementally for 2011. But even still, on an adjusted basis, you are north of 44%, albeit it was a decline from 2009, but it's large part because of those costs. As far as pricing goes, we definitely want to exceed inflation at this point. And if I summed it all up in terms of all the different asset categories for S&P, it would probably be about a 4% price increase for 2011. And we'll see as we go on. McGraw-Hill Financial has a lot more pricing power as it packages more of its data and analytic products. And you're going to see more much more expansion into the broader wealth management and business development areas there. We're very bullish obviously by the Capital IQ growth and the continued growth on that front of it. And I think that margin improvement will come as we are able to bode price and to be able to extend into a more scalable and addressable market.", "Jack Callahan", "Just to elaborate a bit on Terry's point on the cost side, particularly S&P, there was some select hiring particularly outside of the United States and there was also a little bit of step-up in incentive compensations, a good year, and also the layering of some more longer-term incentive-related compensation. So that also were factors too, in addition to the quality and control investments.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then Jack, just question for you on the new reporting, which is helpful. I was wondering maybe if you could give just sort of a breakout of those major segments either by revenue or operating profit for where the benchmarks fall within because it helps on the subscription versus non-subscription, but I was wondering, just by the different segments, if there's a way to break those out?", "Jack Callahan", "Sloan, you're asking within each segment in terms of subscription and non-subscription?", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "No, just as a whole of those four major ones that you provided. And specifically, we're looking at the benchmarks as the one we're trying to split out a little bit?", "Jack Callahan", "You mean the benchmark business within McGraw-Hill Financial?", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Exactly.", "Jack Callahan", "The level of disclosure that we provided right now in terms of the international versus domestic, and the subscription, non-subscription is that as far as we'd like to go right now, particularly as Lou needs some time to really kind of sort out how the organization is going to operate for the long term. So I think that's probably as far as we'd like to go for today.", "Harold McGraw", "And Sloan, the subscription side of McGraw-Hill Financial is about 75% roughly of the revenue and the non-subscription is 25%. And for the most part, Index services is highly represented in the non-subscription area.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then just one last question. I was wondering with regard to the investment on -- CapEx for digital investment in the upcoming year, I was wondering maybe if you could elaborate a little bit on what types of investment those are going to be? And will that be paced over the course of the year and maybe when we can expect some impact of that investment?", "Jack Callahan", "Well, most of that investment that we spoke to today relates to integrating more additional digital content into some of the education product development. And that will be paced in over the balance of a couple of years here as these new programs are developed. So while there be some expansions in some of our digital offering, as Terry referred to, as it relates to our leveraging of Blackboard and our linking to mConnect, the big dollars that we're spending really relate more to some of the future programs that will be introduced in the coming years.", "Harold McGraw", "And increasingly Sloan, putting the education aside for a moment, all of these businesses are putting up products and services that are digitally composed. And so the digital content, it's starting to get a little bit more difficult because most of it is all digital. On the education side, the market is now really pushing more aggressively for digital products in additional ways. And so you're going to see a continued ramp up on that. But I think one of the things that's also very important here is we don't want to go it alone. You're going to see increasingly more and more partnerships like the Blackboard relationship. And I think that when you start creating learning platforms that are already embedded into those systems, the ability to build off of that is going to be very powerful. But we'll do what the market wants. And if it's hybrid print or digital, we're going to go any direction.", "Operator", "This question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Terry, this is just, I guess, a longer-term question. I'm looking at the financial results of the Education business for McGraw-Hill and frankly, they haven't been very impressive over the last, call it, four or five years. And so I'm wondering, two things. One, strategically, why does it make sense for you guys to be in this business? Do you really need to keep putting all the resources into this for pretty much no growth and low capital returns? And then related to that, longer-term vision, where do you think this business could be from a profitability standpoint in the context of these digital transformations you're talking about?", "Harold McGraw", "I think that there's been a lot of factors that's influenced educational publishers in the last several years. Not the least of which has been funding pressures with the economic downturn and the difficulties that certain states are having. If you believe in the overall growth projects, and the overall growth as a country, no country can survive without the solidarity of a fundamental education system. I think we're going in the right direction. I think some of the reformed initiatives, building off of No Child Left Behind, and getting into narrowing the skill gap that is increasingly growing in this country, gives us an opportunity -- there's skill gap everywhere -- and that gives us an enormous opportunity. And I think that a digital environment is going to allow us to really accelerate on some of that which will improve growth rates and improve margins on that part. But you still have the tale of two cities. The Higher Education, Professional and International is growing nicely and the margin participation is strong. And you're going to see more and more partnerships as we get after vocational, professional, managerial, development and training as well as getting thicker into the various disciplines of science, engineering, technology, medical and so forth. On the K-12 side, I think, again with some help in terms of federal guidance in terms of core common standards and things like that, we'll be able to significantly improve on that picture. So I think it is a very exciting platform, and it's critical and vital to the success of our growth as a country on that part. If you get this wrong, how do you get -- how does a country grow. So I think that increased emphasis on getting digital is going to be very important, but also being able to help expand in terms of the specific educational services to reduce those skill gaps on.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "And is 15%, Terry, you think the right margin for that business longer term?", "Harold McGraw", "No. Clearly, as you become increasingly more facile in a digital environment, I think you're going to accelerate your capabilities to target various audiences, and you're going to be able to accelerate top line and bottom line growth, and you should be able to do it more efficiently and therefore get margin improvements. So there is no let-up to the margin improvement that we've talked about in the past and that we expect going forward.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "And then one other thing Terry, the less active share repurchase expectations for 2011, if we read into that, that perhaps you're going to be a little more active from an acquisition standpoint and any particular focus you could point us to?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes. I mean, the cash that Jack talked about is pretty good. And so we've got very high levels there and very low debt. And we just want to, at this point, going into the year make sure that we maintain flexibility. And we're looking at some transactions. We'll also be looking at organic growth projects, things like the Blackboard, things like the Wipro mobile learning platform, but lots of examples of that way. So between dividends and share repurchase, we're very excited about the 6.4% increase in the dividend, and we just want to make sure it's understood that we have a very strong penchant for share repurchase and we're just going to go into the year a little bit more measured. But stay tuned. Everybody competes for the cash, and we'll see what makes sense as we go.", "Jack Callahan", "One of the goals here is to have a real ironclad balance sheet. It's one of the real strengths of the company to avoid -- it buys us a lot of flexibility. And if you think about it, it was really in the fourth quarter where we've had -- followed the back end of 2010, we really started to have a real step-up in our acquisition activity and significant activity. In 2010, we have announced two -- closed one and have another one pending for 2011. So we just believe that it's prudent to maintain our flexibility for the long term.", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, and that's for now, I will say, where we will go.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Is McGraw-Hill Financial the priority from an acquisition standpoint then?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, I think you're going to see priorities across the board. You're going to see significant geographic expansion on the Standard & Poor's side. Remember, given the fact that banks are deleveraging and not lending at the same time, what you're seeing is either the introduction of new local bond markets such as South African, Saudi Arabia, the continuation of expansion in Malaysia, Indonesia and things like that. And that's why we're benefiting from so nicely in India. You're going to see more activity that way, and we're going to be opening up new operations for them. McGraw-Hill Financial is a huge opportunity. And one of the things -- one of the benefits in making it even more transparent and splitting it out, you're going to see a lot of activity on McGraw-Hill Financial as we unlock some of the value that is there, making more transparent, but also the ability to horizontally integrate some of our capabilities so you can focus more carefully, not only on large financial institutions in terms of products and services but also in terms of wealth management, business development, all of those kinds of things. So we're very focused on that side. Digitally, education, it's all things, and we're pushing very aggressively on that with partners, and Jack mentioned Platts and those acquisitions. But J.D. Power, also we're expanding very aggressively in China where car sales right now in China have surpassed here, on that one. So you're going to see a lot of scale. But geographic expansion in digital, the two operative words for us.", "Operator", "This question comes from Craig Huber from Access 342.", "Craig Huber - ", "My first question has to do with each of the last two quarters, your Financial Services cost, looked like, up 13% to 14% year-over-year. Can you please give us some more details on the cost growth there, just to break it out a little better?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, I think, again as the year progressed, we were obviously, as Jack was saying, there was the talent ramp up, there's the incentive compensation, there's the increased cost on the QCCR framework, and there was also some product expansion on that as well. But you've got to remember, as we came into -- we had a very good 2009 fourth quarter, and the first quarter was red-hot. Then the second quarter, significantly, slowed down. And we were trying to gauge at that point just where some of these was going. As you know, spreads were widening. And it wasn't until we got into June that we started seeing the narrowing of spreads, and then the rest of it is history. Corporate, munis, high yields, CLOs, sovereigns, they have just started to come very aggressively. And so with that increased revenue, on that one, there was also some ramp up on the expense side. I mean, it wasn't an even year. It was in anticipation of what the demand was.", "Jack Callahan", "One more minor addition to particularly, in the fourth quarter, if we're looking at the old segment, the Financial Services, it was impacted by the addition of TheMarkets.com, too. But the other drivers were more significant.", "Craig Huber - ", "And then also, you mentioned earlier a price increase in Financial Services recipe, I guess, of roughly 4% for the new year. Were you talking just about the transaction side? Is it also about the same for non-transaction side, too?", "Harold McGraw", "No, that's in large part due to the transaction side, Craig. Again, we take a look at the overall increase on cost per regulatory and other kinds of things that way. We take a look at what inflation factors are there. And so we want to be ahead of inflation, and I would say in some areas, we're going to have a little bit more pricing power. But I think as a rule of thumb at this point, looking at Standard & Poor's for 2011, an aggregate 4% increase would be a good number to factor. But if that changes, then, we obviously will be telling you. But right now, I'd say an aggregate 4% is a good number.", "Craig Huber - ", "But I guess you're suggesting the non-transaction piece what, roughly, half of that maybe -- ballpark?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, about that.", "Craig Huber - ", "And then also, I know you've hit on this a little bit, but do you have much expectations for any significant European regulation changes here as we head into 2011? Or it's just too hard to tell?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, I mean it's certainly fluid, but I'm encouraged. One of the things that -- I mean, when you think about the regulatory setup and you go back to the end of '07 and '08 and '09, everything was coming in vertical steps. You had individual countries, you had different agencies like IOSCO and CESR and the FSA in the U.K. and so forth, the European Commission, so everybody had a different issue and all that. And one of the needs here was to get some level of harmonization so that there's some consistency to all of that. We are in a much, much improved environment, both in Europe, here and increasingly in Asia where some regulation is already proceeded the financial crisis. We're in a much better place. Europe is in a much better place at this point. And we're going to keep pushing for that. And I think as things continue to recover and some of the noise lowers, there is more drive on regulators' part not to go it alone, but also to take into account a broader harmonization. So I think things are definitely improving on that part and will continue to. Just here in the United States, clearly, when we take a look at the Dodd-Frank bill, that is not in stone. The SEC is weighing in all of the time now in terms of where to strengthen, where to amend it and so forth. And so I think that is going to be a process that's going to live with us for a while. And I think that's good. Just because we did pass something at one point in time doesn't mean that we need to live with it forever. There's always amendment going on, and I think we'll see a push for more harmonization.", "Craig Huber - ", "And then lastly Terry, on Education, can you talk a little bit for 2011 for the open territories and residual sales in total. I think that combined they're roughly 3x the size of the adoption market. But what's your expectation for the overall market?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, well, I wish I could. Again, the state environment is a very fluid one. I feel more comfortable on the state adoption side. We think that the floor would be the same level as 2010. Now again, we have to watch a few people like California and Texas, and Texas in particular. But our thinking is that it's going to be better on that one. The open territories is still a very confusing one. As you know, we have gone through a number of years now where the growth has been very low or negative on that part. There is such a huge pent-up demand on that one. And so at some point, it has to start to improve on that one. But let's take a look at it as we get into the year and we get some hard data on some of the states. But right now, I don't have a lot of good guidance on the open territories.", "Operator", "This question comes from William Bird from Lazard.", "William Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the new issue pipeline at S&P? And also, separately, just in higher education, you had some weakness in the quarter. I guess, what lends itself to the bounce back you expect in '11?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, the new issuance numbers that we've put out and that the market is putting out are pretty clear. I mean, we are seeing the continued pace from the third, fourth quarter of last year into the first quarter corporates. And again, in large part because of refinancing activity and also because banks deleveraging and not lending at the same level, the bond market is the market of choice. So corporates are doing really well, high-yield is really doing well, munis are going to do well. We're going to see significant more activity on sovereigns. We're seeing some activity in CLOs. In the structured finance area, you're starting to see besides asset bank, you're starting to see a few issues on the commercial mortgage-backed market. And I think that there's going to be a little bit more pent-up demand that we're going to see using that market a little bit. Residential is going to take time, and all of that. So we don't see much on that side. From a new issuance standpoint, it obviously looks quite good. And by the way again, again, as I was making the comments about local bond markets and the like, increasingly, those numbers are going to be very, very helpful. The financing side is really a huge piece. With maturities between 2011 and 2014, we're looking at about $5.6 trillion of refinancing activity to the end of 2014, and we think that will continue. And the number of that we were using just as a gauge is about $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion a year through 2014. Refinancing is going to be a big piece.", "Jack Callahan", "And Bill, the other part of your question was on Education. And going back to the guidance that Terry laid out, I don't think we're seeing a big bounce back here. I mean, we do think it's, building on Terry's comments, the challenging market to understand we do have to make some investments. We are lapping 25% profit growth which is a huge number here. So we are anticipating profits to be down year-on-year in the Education segment right now, and we're point to sort of a mid-single-digit to perhaps a high single-digit range of declines. So we do think this is going to be a segment that we're going to have to navigate as we go through the year and prepare for the future.", "William Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Yes, I was wondering, I guess, specifically about higher ed which I thought Terry said he expects to be up kind of 4% to 6% in '11, and it looked like the quarter was down about 3%. So I was kind of wondering why it was down and why growth would bounce back so much?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, it goes to the December. As we both know, from a market standpoint, after all of this wonderful growth and really being pushed of a really high enrollment numbers, it sort of hit a wall. We're still trying to understand that. There have been some suggestions that the rental market influenced that, I don't think so. I don't think the rental market is going to be that material to have that kind of an effect, but we did see a turn down in terms of ordering. And we're still working on that. And by the way, as Jack said, January is a little soft, too, on that front. So we'll see it. We're working on that part of it. But I think for the full year, in terms of the demand that we see, that we'll be back on track. But the December, not the fourth quarter, really December was a market then and factor there that we all are trying to explain there.", "William Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "And just stepping back to buybacks, what would move you beyond the measured pace on buybacks?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, I think we've got to take a look, Bill, at the environmental growth, how things are progressing and best uses of cash. I think, and Jack said it well, we're very excited about share repurchase, and we want to come into the year. Given the competition for the cash, that this is a really good position to start with. We'll see as we get into the year. If we complete the 4.2 million shares sooner, and all of that, and we think that that's extremely helpful to the overall picture. Could we go into the remaining 4.2 million shares? Sure, on that one. But I think coming into the year, we have high expectations for 2011. We want to build off of 2010, and that this is a good posture for us to take at this point, then we'll see.", "Operator", "This question comes from Michael Meltz from JPMorgan.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Two questions for you. Following up on Peter and Bill's question, can you just tell us the cash balance, how much of that is trapped outside the U.S.? Is that perhaps an issue that mitigates  repurchase somewhat?", "Jack Callahan", "We don't want to get too -- let's just put it this way. Michael, it's a consideration, particularly kind of given the step-up in acquisition activity that we've had in the fourth quarter and pending in 2011. But I wouldn't call it a huge constraint. But it is a consideration, that is leading us back to make sure we have adequate flexibility particularly as we're starting to see some ideas in the acquisition pipeline, we're starting to do deals now, but we want to make sure we have those chances down the line.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then the other thing, just a commentary on margins. If you didn't say this, but if I back into the -- you're saying S&P ratings revenues up high single-digits. I think the slides said profits up low double-digits. So you're actually pointing to margin expansion in '11 which is I'm happy to see. And I'm just wondering, can you just confirm that's what you're guiding to?", "Jack Callahan", "The guidance we gave was high single-digits for both top line and bottom line. So from the guidance, it's roughly flat margins. But obviously, we're going to work to try to do the best we can there. But again, there's some -- it's back to the quality investments and the international growth investments that we're going to have to pace as we start to build out the global footprint.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "But the more important question, on the attributable margins that you're pointing to at Financials, I guess, you're calling it McGraw-Hill Financial after paying the royalty, those margins are now in the mid-20s. Where do you see that going? My sense is there's a big mix or probably a wide mix of profitability within those properties. I mean, is that a business that can get to the mid-30s in a reasonable amount of time? How do you think about that?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, let me put it another way. As I was mentioning, those businesses for the most part were all, even though they are similar businesses in terms of data business, analytical business and so forth, serving similar addressable markets. They were all managed vertically, and all that. We have begun, as I already said, in terms of creating a horizontal integration to all of this. We're already starting to take out costs and you're going to see a lot more cost coming out on this one. But this is also a high-growth platform, and it's going to get an awful lot of attention. And we're very, very excited about the leadership team there. And so, no, this is -- I think when you start talking about a $1.2-plus-billion segment, with a 26.5% at this point margin, our expectation is for fast growth on the top line and definite margin expansion.", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from Doug Arthur from Evercore.", "Douglas Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Terry, on the refinancing pipeline, it seems -- I mean, you cited some very large numbers but it seems like Europe has not really unlocked yet given the turmoil and spreads over there. Is that something you're building into your expectations for '11? Or could that be an '12 and later event?", "Harold McGraw", "I think it's both. But definitely, we have expectations, Doug, for some of the refinancing activity coming out of Europe. And again, there are part of those maturities that are very evident. But no, I think as we were talking about with ESMA and the oversight direction that they're taking to eliminate some of the noise and to get a little bit more harmonization. And I think that kind of activity is going to pick up.", "Douglas Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc.", "And just a follow-up on the muni side, I mean, I'm surprised that your enthusiasm in the muni outlook, given all the withdrawals we're seeing in the muni funds and the big widening of spreads there, is your view that states have no choice but to come to market?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, again, I think that is a correct assumption. And again, I think that we've take a look at investment-grade and speculative-grade, we're seeing activity straight across the board, and we haven't seen. People keep talking about the defaults and all of those kinds of thing. We look at all sorts of studies over the last 25 years in terms of different kinds of economic scenarios, albeit this is a more challenging one. We rate some 17,500 issuers in here. And the default rate, looking back, is about 2.5 defaults per year. Now an unrated municipal debt, it's a different situation. But in terms of that activity, the default rates are extremely low and all of that. But the demand is going to be high. And it's not just going to come from cutting spending, albeit that's an important function to the whole thing. It's not that, I mean, I wouldn't put it in the same category as corporates or high-yield, but you're going to see growth there and we look forward to that.", "Operator", "Thank you.

I'm Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies.

Today's update will last approximately an hour. After our presentations, the meeting will be open to questions and answers.", "It's now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Harold McGraw.", "Harold McGraw", "Okay. Thank you, Don. And good morning, everybody, and welcome to our conference call. As Don said, with me today is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. We're going to review the first quarter results and the outlook for The McGraw-Hill Companies for the rest of 2011. Following our presentations, obviously, Jack will discuss the key financials, and then we'll go to any questions or comments that anyone has.", "As we reported earlier this morning in our news release on the first quarter results, a promising year is off to a good start. Earnings per share grew by 18.2% to $0.39 a share. Revenue grew by 7.7% to $1.3 billion. Our new segment, McGraw-Hill Financial, is unlocking new value. So let's start today's call by reviewing the performance and the prospect and begin with McGraw-Hill Financial.", "McGraw-Hill Financial is off to a strong start, adding subscribers, 74% of the revenue comes from subscriptions, and growing in both international and domestic markets. In the first quarter, revenue with the addition of TheMarkets.com increased by 16.2% and 11.9% without the acquisition. Operating profit grew by 35.3%. The operating margin expanded to 29.7%.", "McGraw-Hill Financial is focused on integrating and involving its capabilities into 1 scaled operation, offering global financial professionals our high-value content across all asset classes. We continue to make progress in leveraging our intellectual property across the new organization, while growing individual businesses. This activity involves developing innovative and integrated solutions for clients to manage investment and trading strategies. Case in point, a new leveraged loan index for our benchmark group that was created in collaboration between 2 McGraw-Hill Financial businesses, S&P Indices and S&P Leveraged Commentary & Data, designed to expand S&P's family of fixed income indices, the index became the basis of the first bank loan exchange-traded fund to hit the market. ", "Assets under management in the new Invesco PowerShares leveraged loan ETF hit $70 million in the first month. This is just 1 of 32 new exchange-traded funds based on S&P Indices that were introduced in the first quarter of 2011. 18 of the new ETFs by the way were launched outside the United States. We now have 333 exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices with $323 billion in assets under management, and by the way, that's a 27% year-over-year increase.", "As this table illustrates, we maintain an active ETF pipeline to drive revenue growth. Besides driving revenue growth, these new ETFs have also diversified our product offering. In 2006, 62% of assets under management in exchange-traded funds were tied to our largest ETF, and of course, that's the SPDR S&P 500. At the end of 2010, the percentage has dropped to 43%, reflecting the diversification of our ETF revenue across different asset classes and different geographies. Expect more collaboration and diversification. ", "In the Integrated Desktop Solutions group, subscriber demand for Capital IQ data, ratings content from the Global Credit Portal and the addition of TheMarkets.com got the year off to a very strong start. The integration of TheMarkets.com is proceeding smoothly. You can now access TheMarkets.com product via the Capital IQ platform. In the first quarter, Capital IQ grew its client base to more than 3,600, and that's a 23% year-over-year increase. ", "The Enterprise Solutions group was formed to integrate multiple cross-asset data sets and to streamline the delivery of McGraw-Hill Financial, S&P and third-party data into 1 platform. That means, for example, introducing new integrated technologies, such as application program interfaces, or API, to enable clients to more easily incorporate data directly into their systems and into their workflows. Easier access to more information is obviously good for business and allows for greater insight and transparency into the markets our customers serve. We continue to see demand for our data in both pre- and post-trade markets. For example, Global Data Solution continues to grow the number of clients who are buying multiple services instead of just one-off data sets, especially in global markets. ", "We are also pleased to report that in The Wall Street Journal's new annual survey of \"The Best Analysts on the Street,\" Standard & Poor's equity research leads the list of 86 firms with 10 winning analysts. The Best on the Street survey identifies the top 5 analysts in 44 sectors based only on stock-picking skills. To be eligible, analysts generally had to follow at least 5 stocks in an industry group during the year. Nearly 7,000 analysts and more than 500 firms were surveyed. The Wall Street Journal online announced the winners last week. The newspaper will publish the formal list on May 10.", "S&P's Equity Research is an important resource for MarketScope Advisor, which is an online service for more than 80,000 financial advisors. Going forward, S&P Equity Research will be available on Enterprise Solutions and through our Integrated Desktop Solutions group. Clearly, McGraw-Hill Financial is off to a very good start and is finding new ways to unlock value.", "Let's sum up then for McGraw-Hill Financial. We expect double-digit revenue and operating profit growth this year, a combination of strong organic growth and the acquisitions of Markets.com [TheMarkets.com].", "Okay, let's move over to Standard & Poor's. Powerful trends and record issuance in global bond markets were evident in Standard & Poor's first quarter top line performance. Revenue grew by 10.4%, but operating profits increased by 0.8%, primarily because of timing issues, difficult expense comparisons and a decline in Structured Finance. The operating margin was 43%. With year-over-year cost comparisons easing in subsequent quarters and favorable market trends expected to continue, we now anticipate that Standard & Poor's operating profit will accelerate for the balance of the year. That implies about 10% growth over the balance of the year to meet our current forecast of high single-digit operating profit growth for the full year.", "Let's start by reviewing the difference between the top and bottom line growth in the first quarter. First, foreign exchange negatively impacted profits in Q1. While foreign exchange rates increased S&P revenue by $1.9 million, it reduced operating profit by $6.1 million. Excluding foreign exchange, revenue grew by 9.9%, and operating profit increased by 4.1%.", "Second, the first quarter represented S&P's most difficult expense comparison. Q1 2010 margins were 47%, the highest of the year, versus a full year 2010 adjusted margin of 44.5%. That record was achieved despite the fact that Q1 2010 was S&P's lowest revenue quarter of the year and lower than the first quarter of 2011 by $42 million.", "Third, expense comparisons will become easier as the year progresses. S&P has made significant investment in technology platforms and staff to deal with the new regulations of credit rating agencies. That's the QCCR program that you've heard us talk about, and again, QCCR stands for quality, criteria, compliance and risk, which are managed independently of the ratings business. In 2010, we incurred incremental QCCR costs of $17 million, with efforts focusing on the implementation of the European Union and Japanese requirements, which were effective towards the end of the year. As a result, this increase was almost entirely realized in the second half of 2010, making first-half comparisons particularly challenging. For 2011, we anticipate an incremental increase of $12 million to $15 million and expect the increase to be more evenly spread. In subsequent years, we expect QCCR costs to increase at a lower rate, level off and possibly decline as new regulatory requirements subside.", "Staffing increase, mostly at CRISIL in India, include the acquisition of Pipal Research late in 2010. The factors that helped produce a strong close in the fourth order last year underpinned our solid top line growth in the first quarter of 2011 and our prospects for the remainder of this year. ", "Transaction revenue at Standard & Poor's grew by 17.2% in the first quarter as worldwide high-yield corporate bond issuance of $124.4 billion eclipse the previous record of $121.1 billion set in the fourth quarter of 2010. A key contributor to this performance was European high-yield issuance, which grew by 95% to $36.3 billion in the first quarter, and that's a new record too. A solid increase in investment-grade bonds and robust growth in bank loan ratings also contributed to our growth.", "  As this table shows, refinancing was key to the high-yield volume. According to the S&P Leveraged Commentary & Data group, 64% of the proceeds were used for refinancings in the first quarter, coincidentally, refinancing activity represented also 64% of the high-yield bond volume last year.", "The rapidly growing leveraged loan market remains centered around what S&P calls the 3 Rs of leveraged lending: repricing, refinancing and recapitalization. There is still unrealized potential in this market. S&P estimates that there is $5.6 trillion in bond and loan maturities coming due in the U.S. and Europe between 2011 and 2014, and while some of the 2011 maturities have already been refinanced coming into this year, S&P estimated maturities in the range of $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion per year between 2011 and 2014. An improving economy, low default rates and very low yields on less risky debt should keep investors focused on opportunities in the high-yield and leveraged loan markets all year. ", "In the search for yields, some investors are turning out -- are tuning out concerns about risk. We have seen deals oversubscribed for companies with B- ratings. The increased role of hedge funds in the high-yield market has also opened up a bigger market for CCC rated debt. The search for yield will persist, as interest rates remain low and spreads, the excess interest rate over treasury bonds, remain tight. ", "As this table shows, the speculative-grade composite spread had tightened to 478 basis points at the end of the first quarter. Both speculative-grade and investment-grade composite spreads at the end of the first quarter were well below the 5-year daily moving average.", "An increasingly active M&A market should also contribute to growth in new issuance, and with banks less willing or less able to lend, new borrowers will turn to the public debt markets. We continue to move ahead without much help from the public or the Structured Finance markets. ", "Public finance issuance fell by 52% in the first quarter. The decline is largely attributed to the expiration of the Build America Bond program at the end of 2010. It may take some time for the public finance market to show year-over-year growth. ", "The Structured Finance market was mixed, soft in the United States and more active in Europe. But even with the decline in Structured Finance surveillance due to the defaults and maturing deals, non-transaction revenue grew by 6.3% to $266.6 million and represented 60.2% of S&P's total revenue in the first quarter. Non-transaction revenue now includes a royalty of $15.2 million, which McGraw-Hill Financial pays for the right to use and distribute S&P's content. Increased revenue from CRISIL, our majority-owned company in India, and nonissue based analytical services also helped offset the decline in Structured Finance. We confidently expect S&P's non-transaction revenue to continue growing in 2011.", "Earlier, I reviewed the costs of creating our QCCR framework to deal with regulations. We expect more regulations this year. There will be some new rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission to implement requirements mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. New rules have been passed in Hong Kong, and we anticipate new regulations from Canada and Singapore. Many of them incorporate European Union requirements in an effort to meet EU equivalents requirements for the endorsement and compliance with IOSCO model Code of Conduct for rating agency. That's security commissioners out of Madrid. ", "We are also working with regulators and market participants on the implementation of new rules for credit ratings in the European Union relating to endorsement. The bottom line, S&P has implemented a sound and effective control framework to accommodate compliance with additional regulatory requirements.", "We continue to make progress on the legal front. To date, 20 of our motions to dismiss have been granted in their entirety. 8 more lawsuits have been voluntarily withdrawn. It's also worth noting that 5 of the dismissed cases involved fraud charges. As we have said all along, we continue to believe the legal risk is low.", "In the CalPERS case, a hearing has been set for August 23 on whether the plaintiff can demonstrate that it has substantial evidence to support each element of its claim and if there is a probability of success on the merits of its claim. The burden shifted to CalPERS after the court granted our motion that the complaint fails under a California stature protecting speech made in the public interest. ", "Discovery continues in the Abu Dhabi case. In the Anschutz case, a New York court dismissed the plaintiff's claim of negligent misrepresentation in regard to the securities issued by Merrill Lynch. But in the California federal court, the same claim involving securities issued by Deutsche Bank survived a motion to dismiss. We have asked the California judge to permit us to seek an appeal of this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in view of the clear conflict with the New York federal court's dismissal rating.", "Overseas, we have submitted our final brief in the Parmalat case and now await a ruling. And last week, a German court dismissed another lawsuit relating to S&P's Lehman's ratings, recognizing that ratings disseminated globally from our U.S. ratings business should not subject S&P to lawsuits in Germany without some specific connection to that nation.", "So let's sum up then for Standard & Poor's: legal risk remains low, regulatory issues are manageable, high single-digit revenue growth for 2011, operating profit will accelerate for the balance of the year and grow in the high single digits for the full year.", "Okay. With that, let's go on to McGraw-Hill Education. For McGraw-Hill Education, in the first quarter, revenue decreased by 4.6%. The operating loss increased by 22.2%, and that was reflecting the revenue decline and ramped up investment for digital infrastructure that will position us for future growth. Given the seasonality of the education market, we recognize that the first quarter results are a small fraction of the year and certainly are not indicative of what's ahead for 2011.", "In the elementary-high school market, first quarter sales are mainly orders for replacement copies. In higher education, the sales mainly reflect last year's adoptions. In both markets, the first quarter through mid-May is the major selling season for this summer's orders. Our sales force is in the field and working hard to ensure success in the seasonally important third quarter.", "But there is something different about the first quarter this year. It is simply this: the robust double-digit growth of digital products, particularly in higher education and the professional markets. Digital products and services are the harbinger of change that is coming in the education market. No one can be sure when the tipping point will occur, but we cannot sit back and wait for it to arrive. Our investment in digital capabilities and capacity builds on McGraw-Hill Education's continued success in the marketplace. It positions us to meet the growing demand for our digitally delivered products that is already evident in testing, in K-12 and higher education and in professional market, and it will support the launch of a broad array of new digital products that are now in our pipeline. ", "The heightened investment in digital products reflects the opportunity created by our markets' increasing capacity to utilize wholly digital products delivered online, whether through numerous sites that McGraw-Hill operates, sites maintained by educational entities ranging from individual public schools in the U.S. to major colleges and universities around the world or sites operated by third-party providers, such as Amazon.", "For 2 decades, McGraw-Hill Education has been able to supply significant content in digital form, owing to ongoing investments in the transformation of our internal publishing processes. That transformation is now complete, enabling us to pour content into a variety of format, print or digital, as indicated by market demands. These investments are already enhancing our opportunities for 2011 and beyond. New and forthcoming digital products from McGraw-Hill Education represent a new generation of digital resources. A far cry from the static PDF versions of print books, they feature the interactivity and audiovisual capabilities of digital media that a critical mass of customers now have the bandwidth to access and to fully utilize.", "Our new products are designed to differentiate us from others and genuinely enhance the teaching and learning experience. In the el-hi market, there are the recent releases of CINCH Math and CINCH Science, full curriculum basal instruction materials delivered online. We're the only publisher to offer comprehensive all-digital programs in these subjects. In the testing market, the shift to online testing and all-digital reporting is a growing trend. With Acuity, our leading product in the formative assessment market, students can be tested online using paper and pencil or with hand-held response devices. Increasingly, schools are choosing the online option. ", "In Higher Education, we have McGraw-Hill Connect, the industry's most-advanced homework management platform for students and Create [McGraw-Hill Create], a digital publishing system that allows instructors to build customized e-books for their courses. We have the highly sophisticated computer adaptive tutoring programs, LearnSmart and ALEKS. And for several years now, all of our front-list higher education titles have been available for purchase as e-books from a wide variety of vendors and for a wide range of e-reading devices.", "In professional markets, we are seeing steady increases in the number of subscribers, domestic and international, for our digital resource sites in medicine, engineering and business. More than 6,000 of our professional titles are currently available as e-books, and we are introducing a line of enhanced e-books featuring embedded audio and video content. Our product line of downloadable applications for mobile devices is also going strong in the professional market. We offer more than 150 apps for business, medical, technical and educational test preparation, and another 75 apps will be added this year.", "The growth of digital products clearly requires technology systems, robust platforms that guarantee product performance. That's a second factor in our increased investment. As the delivery of digital content has shifted away from CD-ROMs and local servers to the Internet, it is imperative for online providers to ensure reliable accessibility and functionality 24/7.", "That's why we recently made a substantial investment in the creation of a state-of-the-art digital hosting and support center, which is paying off an increased product reliability. But with a higher usage, we are experiencing for current products and with many new projects in the pipeline, including the expansion of online testing, we will be making the incremental investments in infrastructure and utilizing the cloud to ensure our capacity, as well as our ability, to provide the necessary levels of expert customer support.", "We expect our digital products and services to produce another solid year of growth in 2011. As the second quarter selling season progresses, we are monitoring district adoption activity levels, state funding developments and buying patterns across our markets. We think the el-hi market is stabilizing. The state new adoption market could still meet or exceed 2010 levels. But that depends, to a great extent, on the Texas legislature and how it funds instructional materials. We probably won't know much about which programs will be funded and for how much until sometime in May, maybe towards the end of May. We are currently also very carefully watching North Carolina. There's a reading and literature adoption that was recently called for purchase this year, but here again, the funding has not been approved, and we're waiting for that. There are signs of pent-up demand in the open territory, which is very pleasing. But it's, again, still early days in this market and too soon to make a forecast.", "In the U.S. college and university market, we still believe the market will grow between 4% and 6%. Enrollments are expected to show modest growth after the surge in the last 2 years. In 2011, we will begin to see the benefits of our Blackboard connection. It's hard to overstate the value of offering students and instructors a single point of access for course content and study tools through Blackboard's learning management system. Earlier this month, we expanded what began as a domestic arrangement with Blackboard to international markets as well.", "Let's sum up. Our expectation for the Education market: flat to middle growth in the elementary-high school market, 4% to 6% growth in the U.S. higher education market and for McGraw-Hill Education in 2011, revenue growth in the low single digits, a decline in operating profit driven by investments, especially for digital developments. The decrease could range from mid-single digits to high single digits.", "And finally, let's review McGraw-Hill Information & Media. In 2010, this segment substantially improved its operating margin. And at that time, we said the improvement was not a 1-year phenomenon. We said the new level was sustainable. In the first quarter, Information & Media started delivering on that promise of sustainability. With revenue growth of 10.3%, the operating margin improved to 16.4%, up from 13.5% for the same period last year.", "We are benefiting from the growth in key markets. But what is less well recognized is that our Business-to-Business Group is now primarily a subscription business delivered digitally. Currently, more than 70% of the B2B Group's revenue is digital. Revenue for the B2B Group increased by 10.3% in the first quarter, fueled by growth at Platts, J.D. Power and the acquisition of BENTEK Energy in January. ", "Platts has a strong position in the data, price discovery and market news across many commodities, including oil, natural gas, coal, metals, petrochemicals, nuclear and electricity. Acquiring BENTEK Energy is Platts\u2019 latest step to expand its capabilities in core markets. As this graph illustrates, BENTEK, with its expertise in natural gas, adds to Platts capabilities in 3 key area along its value chain. The goal is to embed our news and prices in the traders\u2019 workflow and provide new analytical capabilities. The growing demand for oil and the uncertainty of supply creates energy price volatility and new clients for the entire range of Platts' products and services. That was evident again in Platts' first quarter performance.", "J.D. Power also grew globally, benefiting from the recovery in domestic and the international auto markets, but the growth was not limited to the automotive market. J.D. Power also showed gains in healthcare, financial services and in insurance markets. J.D. Power expects continued recovery in the worldwide automotive market. J.D. Power now forecast 7% growth this year in global light vehicle sales and 20% growth in the United States.", "A pick-up  in automotive time sales and increased retransmission revenue contributed to McGraw-Hill Broadcasting, 10.2% increase in the first quarter revenue. And therefore, summing up for Information & Media revenue growth in the mid-single digits, adjusted operating profit growth in the mid-single digits as well.", "Wrapping up then for The McGraw-Hill Companies overall, we're obviously very pleased with the solid start to the year, but the first quarter is seasonally small. We continue to maintain our guidance of diluted earnings per share of $2.79 to $2.89.", "Okay. With that and our 4 segments, let me turn it over now to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, for some added financial guidance. Jack?", "Jack Callahan", "Thank you, Terry, and good morning to everyone on the call this morning. It is a pleasure to review with you a strong start to 2011. Today, I will focus on a robust cash outlook and strong financial position, capital allocation and a couple of corporate items. ", "We continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. Before dividends, we expect to generate cash flow greater than $1 billion. After dividends, free cash flow is projected to be in excess of $700 million. ", "We expect to generate this strong free cash flow despite increased capital investments. For 2011, we continue to expect prepublication investment of roughly $200 million to $225 million or approximately a $50 million to $75 million increase versus 2010, which was an unusually low year.", "Capital expenditures are projected to be up to $150 million, driven in part by increased digital and technology investments. This compares to $115 million in 2010.", "We are extremely well capitalized with net cash and short-term investments at quarter end of approximately $100 million. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, while gross debt was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in long-term unsecured senior notes. No commercial paper is outstanding.", "Turning to capital allocation. We spent $250 million in total on acquisitions and share repurchases in the first quarter, which were the primary drivers of a $250 million decline in cash and short-term investments from year end. We spent $126 million on acquisitions, the most notable being the BENTEK Energy acquisition, which, as Terry discussed, is now part of Platts in the Information & Media segment. In Q1, recent acquisitions accelerated revenue growth by approximately 150 basis points, while the profit impact was modestly dilutive.", "We also actively repurchased shares in the quarter. We repurchased 3.3 million shares for approximately $124 million, averaging $37.44 per share. A step-up  in share repurchases this year versus our initial guidance is under consideration given our cash position and a reduced cash commitment for acquisitions now that the previously announced OPIS transaction has been withdrawn. As a reminder, there are 5.1 million shares remaining in the current 2007 program. To further increase buybacks,  a new program would need consideration and formal authorization by the Board of Directors.", "Going forward, our robust free cash flow and strong balance sheet enables us to selectively add attractive, strategically relevant businesses, like BENTEK, to the McGraw-Hill portfolio while continuing to return cash to shareholders via share repurchases subject to market conditions.", "Now finally, let me address some corporate items. Corporate expense was $34 million in the quarter and decreased by 4% or $1.5 million from the prior year. 2011 expense benefited from a decline in real estate costs, as well as tight cost control. For the full year, we expect corporate expense to increase in the mid-single digit range versus 2010 adjusted corporate expense of $164 million. The 2010 expense excludes the one-time charge of $15.6 million related to subleasing excess space in the company's New York facilities.", "Net interest expense was $19 million in the first quarter, a modest decline of $3 million versus prior year. We still expect full year interest to be largely comparable to 2010, which was $82 million.", "Our effective tax rate was 36.4% in the first quarter, flat versus last year. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $4.2 million, largely driven by CRISIL. ", "Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter was 309.6 million, a 6.7 million decrease from the prior year and a 0.7 million decrease from the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline is due primarily to share repurchases, which more than offset equity-related awards.", "In closing, I appreciate all the hard work from our associates across The McGraw-Hill Companies to deliver a solid start to 2011, and we appear to be on track for a good year.", "Now let me turn the call back over to Don Rubin for the Q&A session. Don?", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you, Jack. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] We are now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question today is from William Bird with Lazard.", "William Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Terry, I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing in the S&P pipeline. And then second, your outlook for higher ed seems to be at odds with the recent declines you've seen. Just wondering what you expect to drive growth in that sub-segment. Thank you.", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, thanks. The S&P pipeline continues to be strong. Now obviously, the Structured Finance side is soft, and especially here in the United States, although we're seeing some activity in asset-backed deals, and we expect a pickup in the commercial mortgage-backed market. But the residential mortgage-backed market, obviously, remains very low. Where we are starting to see some structured activity is in Europe, and that's starting to pick up. But again, the corporate market, sovereign market, the muni market is off and as conditions exist state-by-state and city. But also, Bill, we're seeing a lot in the high-yield market and a little bit in the CLO market and so from a pipeline standpoint, it's quite good. So we were pleased with a 10.4% revenue increase, and we expect that to continue into the rest of the year on that part. As far as higher ed  goes, Bill, again, the move on the digital side is really helping us on that, not only in the professional side but, more importantly, with McGraw-Hill Connect and those capabilities, and we're going to continue to push very aggressively on that. And again, we will continue -- it's a little early, the 4% to 6%, I think, is conservative. And on that 1, we'll see where we go with that and probably have a little better indication as we get closer to June on that part. But it's solid on that part, and we expect it to be a good generator for us for the full year.", "Jack Callahan", "Bill, and higher ed more specifically, I think on the last call, we spoke to a little bit of weakness in our results as we ended 2010 and into the early part of 2011. We did see a bit of a pickup as we closed out Q1 in March and early indications that April is off to a solid start. So it looked -- well, a bit of a rebound from the trends we had spoken to earlier.", "William Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "This question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Thank you. Terry, the strength in the McGraw-Hill Financial business is particularly impressive, so just a couple of questions on that. First, the margin of 29.7% you did in the first quarter, do you think that's a reasonable run rate for the year? Secondly, as we think about the 4 segments, maybe you'd mentioned this and I didn't get it, but was there 1 particular product line or segment that drove the year-to-year strength that we saw in the first quarter?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, and again, thanks, Peter, because we're very pleased with the start with McGraw-Hill Financial. Now we've known this for a little bit, and unlocking value is, I think, is the right phrase here. We've seen good client attraction at Capital IQ. The efforts to integrate all of these businesses in terms of a horizontal platform is going very well. And so the Integrated Desktop Solutions business has been a source of strength for us. But it's really being able to combine a lot of different data and to embed it into customer workflows that we're getting that kind of benefit. Obviously, on the index side, continued growth there. I mean, we're up to 333 exchange-traded funds based on S&P Indices, and 1 of the nice things is, is that we were talking about the diversification and the geographic distribution is broadening in all of that. And so we're very pleased with that, and I think that given some of the shifts that you're seeing in terms of the consolidation move, in terms of exchanges and the like, where exchanges are trying to differentiate themselves through product differentiation, plays to our strength in all that, and so we're benefiting from that. But yes, we're very pleased with the strong start, and as far as the margin is concerned, again, because of the royalty rate, it was probably a little artificial at the end of the fourth quarter in terms of where the margin was. We like where the margin is now on this 1, and we think that we can do better now on that one, and we'll see as the year progresses.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Terry, can I just sneak in 1 other question, the -- unrelated to that, on the Education market, the pace of M&A activities has definitely picked up recently. Does McGraw-Hill need to be -- to make acquisitions or step up spending to stay truly competitive in terms of these digital initiatives?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, you've got to differentiate between acquisition and organic growth. Things like McGraw-Hill Connect and Create, we\u2019ve put an awful lot of effort into that digital transformation, and we're benefiting from that. When you start talking about different ways of being able to present content in  various platforms, the arrangement that we entered into with Blackboard has helped us a lot that way. We've put a lot of effort into the testing side, and rather than acquiring capabilities, we built the Acuity platform that we're benefiting from now on the formative side. So, I mean, it's always a balance on that one. If there's a capability that is going to help you accelerate into a particular opportunity, okay. But it's a balance between being able to develop that capability or whether you acquire that capability. But again, in terms of the positioning that we've take [ph], it's been a combination of both, and we'll continue to watch that balance.", "Jack Callahan", "Yes, and we're continuing to look very closely at those opportunities. I think the 2 things I would just add on Terry's comments is we just want to be sure that any of these acquisitions are not -- that they really help us accelerate our core strategy and moving forward and they're not distractions. And secondly, we want to be very disciplined when it comes to valuation. Some of these properties are quite rich.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "This question is from Sloan Bohlen from Goldman Sachs.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just a follow on from Peter's question, just a little bit of trying to dig into what the costs on that digital expenditure is. 1, if you could provide a little bit of granularity, you talked a little bit about digital hosting being 1 area that, maybe if you could kind of break out the buckets of where the spending is? And then second, if you could think about maybe just the longer term, what you guys are looking for in terms of return on invested capital?", "Harold McGraw", "Okay. You want to go ahead?", "Jack Callahan", "Could you repeat the first part of the question again so I'll be sure that I'm in the right place?", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Sure, Jack. Just in terms of the different buckets for what types of -- on the digital investment side, you talked a little bit about digital hosting, how much of it\u2019s that  versus how much of it is investment in the cloud? Just want to try and get a break up because it seems like a big...", "Jack Callahan", "Well, I can -- at least, I can in the context of like, say, the Education segment, where obviously we have a great deal of work to extend out that digital portfolio. A good part of, as you said, the year-on-year decline or the increased loss this year versus the quarter of last year were largely related to digital investments, largely in support of our higher ed and, to some degree, our professional business. And there's also -- I would also add there's also maybe some -- there's also some investment from a hosting point of view as  relates to our online testing capability that we have too with Education. So those are the primary drivers within -- in the first quarter. But going forward, we anticipate that we'll extend more broadly into the K-12 space as we start to move forward on the development of future programs.", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, and I think also, Sloan, that again, we're all watching the market activity very carefully. In many cases, digital or hybrid product is going to be critical in terms of being able to be successful in some of the adoptions. We are obviously watching Texas very carefully and also North Carolina, as I mentioned, in all of that, and it's a little bit too early to tell here. But again, from the transformation aspect of costs associated with digital, you've got to be there on that 1 to be competitive in those kind of adoption markets.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. A follow up with that 1 and just 1 more if I could, just Terry, you talked a little bit about the drivers of the non-transactional revenues at S&P. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what is driving that bigger pool?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, again, when you're talking about the surveillance and the compliance side of this, you've got an awful lot of fees generated with the refinancing activities and the like, and so those will continue to be very strong contributors. But it's really having to do more with the annual fees associated with the surveillance.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. All right. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "This question comes from Michael Meltz with JPMorgan.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Thank you, 2 clarifications then an actual question for you. You reiterated the EPS guidance for the year, and it sounds like, through the presentation, you're basically reiterating everything you said back in February in terms of revenues and EBIT projections for the segments. Can you just -- or is that true?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, Michael, I think that -- I mean, this is the first quarter, it's the smallest quarter of the year. We're off to a really good start, and we're pleased with that, but it's 1 quarter and the start of the year. I think the message really is, is that things are really in shape for a good year here. How good? We'll see as we get a little bit more market evidence, I think, but it's shaping up very nicely. So at this point, and in terms of earnings guidance and the like, it's too early to make any changes that way. So the $2.79, $2.89 is, as you say, a repeat from February. But we'll see. Let's see, let's see where the strength in some of the issuance, let's see the continued strength, the McGraw-Hill Financial across-the-board, let's see how Platts and J.D. Power continue, and then I think by the time we get together in a couple of months, we'll have a better picture of the full year, and then we can talk about fine tuning. But right now, it's just 1 quarter, start of the year. What's pleasing is that it's a good start and that everything is sort of falling in shape the way we were hoping it would, and we'll just see how strong it gets.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then Peter's question on M&A, the educational M&A, it sounds like from your response, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you, Terry, you said 3x capabilities, Jack said discipline and you don't want distractions. Is the inference that we should take that you are more focused on tuck-unders  than larger transformational acquisitions?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, I mean, again, I mean in terms of the opportunity, the market opportunity aspect of this thing, the digital transformation is critical. This is moving at a pace that is very rapid, and if you don't have the internal capabilities, I mean, you just can't go shopping and buy a little of this, a little of that and overpay  and go through all the integration capabilities and the like. You have to have the internal capabilities to do that. And so what we have done is, both in terms of staffing and in terms of platform capability, we have really put a lot of effort into building that core competency. And again, that's why we have been able to develop McGraw-Hill Connect, which is far and away a superior online product and being able to scale it now even more is going to be very important. McGraw-Hill Create is going to be important there. What we did in terms of getting after administrative platforms is we entered into an exclusive arrangement with Blackboard to be able to accelerate that. And again, as I was mentioning to Peter, the Acuity platform, that was homegrown. That was home built, and we're very pleased with obviously the formative testing market and where that takes us. So it's always a balance on that 1. So yes, we're looking for components and capabilities, but whatever it is that you do on that 1, you have to have internally the core competencies to be able to grow it. And so that's the focus that we have taken and how you get there really is a balance.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then my actual question on -- just to drill down a little bit further, I know you went over this in the slides, the S&P ratings expenses or margin in the first quarter. Can you just maybe explain again, I guess, the EBIT growth was fairly or very light in Q1. The margin was disappointing in Q1. And just you mentioned compliance costs will decline in the second half year-over-year. I assume the international expansion costs are still in there, the higher markets acquisition costs are -- I'm sorry, the Pipal is still in there. What else will be different? If revenue growth is similar the next few quarters, what else will be different in expenses?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, I mean, again, these are all timing issues and factors on this. There's a couple of factors, and we were breaking them down for you. The QCCR and the data infrastructure aspect has been a big part. Just making sure that our systems are as bulletproof as possible, and so we focused a lot on that part, and so that's a portion of it. We've got investments in analytical resources, and this is U.S., outside the United States, India as well. You got the foreign exchange aspect, both the constant currency and the transaction side, and we also had some one-time items from India. You've got the real estate gains on 1 standpoint, and you've got the Pipal acquisition on the other and so we've broken it down. What you're looking at in terms of revenue, you had an increase of revenue and again, in a smaller quarter, $42 million in revenue, and that got us the 10.4% revenue gain. But in expenses, we had a $40 million increase as well, and it's those factors, the categories, that did that. We don't see that going forward. We feel very good about the full year profit picture, and you will start to see in the second, third and fourth quarter the profit margin there. And again, we're talking about for the balance of the year, about 10%, and that would get you to your low single digit. Now if we start to see a pickup in some of the issuance again, especially into the bank loan market in terms of some of the high yield, in terms of some of the corporates, that will obviously benefit, but we should wait a little bit and see some of that results before we start projecting that. But yes, these are just more one-time hits into the first quarter, and we feel very good about the full year. Jack, you want to add anything to that?", "Jack Callahan", "I would just add that a couple of these things are not necessarily new to the first quarter. They're being -- starting to be layered in last year, and if you look at the margin sort of in the back half of 2010 for S&P, they're pretty much in line with the margins that we posted here in the first quarter. So I think as we work our way through these overlaps in the first half of 2011, I think we'll return to more solid profit growth beginning in the second quarter, but then I think more extensively in the back half of the year.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Thank you for your time.", "Operator", "This question comes from Craig Huber from Access 342.", "Craig Huber - ", "I had a similar question on these costs for S&P, maybe I'll just ask a little bit differently here. This $40 million increase in S&P costs year-over-year, how much of that should we think of is not going to repeat by the time we get to the second half of the year? Could you break that out?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, let me let Jack go through more specifically some of the numbers on this. But again, the 2 big pieces here really are the foreign exchange and also the QCCR. 1 of the things that we're going to see, Craig, is that, as you know, I mean over the last 3 years, the investment that we have made in the overall QCCR has been significant. We knew that this was going to peak about now, and that's why we came up with the forecast that in QCCR, we saw a $10 million to $15 million incremental increase this year. We're taking a lot of that in the first quarter on that one. So the reason that we're very optimistic about the rest of the year is that those costs now significantly subside and are behind us, and we'll benefit from that. And again, outside of the India situation, the acquisition there, it's additional investments. But Jack, do you want to give any more color on that?", "Jack Callahan", "Well, I think about 2/3 of this increase, I would view it as it\u2019s sort of being worked into the run rate, that these costs start to be worked into the run rate back in the third quarter of last year. So I think we lap that as we get into the back half. And then in Q1 itself, between currency and some other things, there's probably $10 million, $12 million of sort of one-time impacts that are now behind us.", "Craig Huber - ", "Okay. Then also, can you speak about your issuance trends in Asia in the quarter and also the long-term opportunity there?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, let's see. Again, the markets are still dominated obviously by more of the developed countries. What we're seeing, as you know, is the development of local bond markets literally around the world as there's less reliance on banks. So what we're seeing is increased activity in those countries that have higher consumption to GDP ratios and that are showing nice growth. So obviously, outside of the large developing countries, India, Brazil and China, you're seeing activity in Malaysia, you're seeing Korea, you're seeing Indonesia and a little bit in Thailand. And so we have invested significantly in terms of developing local relations in all of those markets. But we continue to -- we will continue to see much more participation coming out of the Asian markets and especially out of the ASEAN groups in the years ahead. But it's still a smaller portion, and therefore, the growth rates are high because it's coming off of low bases. But those markets are going to be quite strong.", "Craig Huber - ", "Then also, can you just discuss a little further about your outlook for Structured Finance for the remainder of the year, please?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, I mean, what we're looking at, Craig, is obviously that there is more structured activity that we're seeing coming out of Europe than here. The asset-backed market never went away, and I think that there was -- given fear and uncertainty, I mean, I think there was less issuance, but it never went away and so that is pretty strong. What we're looking for domestically is probably a pick-up  in the commercial mortgage-backed market. I think it's going to be a while for the residential part of the market. But again, in terms of some of the collateralized loan obligations and things like that, I think it's an improving picture. And I can't say that we will return to pre-crisis conditions, but I think over the next 2, 3 years, whatever, you're going to see just a steady momentous pick-up  in structured activity on that 1, and I just think there's going to be obviously a lot less risk associated with it and, therefore, less yield orientation. But it's an improving situation but slow.", "Craig Huber - ", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from Doug Arthur from Evercore.", "Douglas Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Yes, Terry, when you look ahead to funding, the funding situation for the local school districts and states for the third quarter, el-hi market. How big a role will the federal government play this year as opposed to last year? Is that up, down, flat or how is it playing out?", "Harold McGraw", "I think it's going to be more of the same. I think that obviously, we, like you, are watching very carefully how the federal government is implementing some of the race-to-the-top  funds and the like, and there should be federal improvement that way as more states are pushing for Common Core Standards and the like. But I mean, it's obviously a question mark. If you take people by their direct comments and words, the federal portion is going to be higher this year, but we've got to see it. And in some cases, you're seeing more implementation on the race to the top, and some people are still pending on that part. Places like Texas, for example, they're going to be fine on their own. We just have to make sure that they're going to do what they say they're going to do on that 1. But I think the federal portion in 2011 should go up based on the comments and statements that have been made, but we've got to see it.", "Douglas Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Great. Thanks.", "Harold McGraw", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that concludes this morning's call.

We thank everyone for joining us this morning for The McGraw-Hill Companies' Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. I'm Donald Rubin, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies. With me today are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jack Callahan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "This morning, we issued a news release with our results. We trust you have all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com. Once again, that's www.mcgraw-hill.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted revenue and free cash flow information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as management's.

However, this call is for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at area code (212) 512-3151 subsequent to this call. Today's update will last approximately an hour. After the presentations, we will open the meeting to questions and answers.", "It's now my pleasure to introduce the Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Terry McGraw.", "Harold McGraw", "Okay, thank you very much, Don. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's conference call. Besides Don, as Don mentioned, with me today is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. He'll be providing a little bit more color to our financials in just a moment. ", "We have 2 objectives for today's call. First, we want to review our encouraging second quarter results and share our perspective on the positive outlook that we have for the second half of this year. Second, we want to update you on our important strategic portfolio review, which is intended to accelerate global growth and unlock shareholder value.  And as always, after our presentations, we'll be pleased to address any of your comments, questions or we can go any direction you'd like. ", "I trust that you all had an opportunity to review our second quarter earnings release. If you recall, on our first quarter call in April, we said a promising year was off to a good start. Well, our second quarter results bear that out. Overall, our business is performing well. Earnings per share in the second quarter grew approximately 12% to $0.68 per share. Revenue grew more than 7% to $1.6 billion. We're very pleased with that. ", "Our revenue growth for the first half is the best since 2007. First half revenue increased by 7.4% to $2.9 billion. Earnings per share grew by 14.4% to $1.07. Based on our solid start this year and a promising outlook for the second half, we now expect to achieve the top end of our 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance of $2.79 to $2.89. ", "While we're encouraged by our first half results and prospects for the year, we are intent on growing faster and unlocking shareholder value by allocating our resources to support the best opportunities in growing global markets. That process is already well along. The most recent review of our businesses began with a decision to create McGraw-Hill Financial as a new segment for 2011. ", "We reorganized and refocused this business and put it under separate leadership to leverage our intellectual property for new value creation. By integrating previously separate but strong and successful business lines into one scaled operation, McGraw-Hill Financial is delivering a growing array of innovative solutions and high-value content across all asset classes to financial professionals around the world. ", "Our S&P Indices business and the new Integrated Desktop Solutions Group, which includes Capital IQ, continue to grow rapidly, driving year-over-year increases of 13.5% in revenue and 17.3% in operating profit in the second quarter. ", "McGraw-Hill Financial is now actively reviewing opportunities for creating even more value through organic growth, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. But that's not the whole story.  And so last month, we informed the market that a strategic review of the entire portfolio is underway. The goal, quite simply, is to increase shareholder value by building on the high-growth global brands at the core of our franchise. ", "Many of you have asked what this review entails and what is our timeline. What we can tell you today is this: We have multiple work streams underway that everything is being scrutinized and that we expect to continue this process with a number of significant actions in the second half of this year. As an important corollary to this process, we're also evaluating our organization structure and design and our G&A costs across the corporation to ensure that we are both nimble and responding to an ever more dynamic marketplace while improving overall efficiency. ", "Excellent examples of effective capital allocation are the recent investments to expand our high-growth Platts business. An underappreciated gem, Platts is the most global brand, with clients in more than 150 countries subscribing to our realtime news, data and price discovery services for energy, petrochemicals, metals and other important commodities. Platts is also one of our fastest-growing businesses, and this year alone, we have enhanced its organic growth with 2 significant additions to its platform. ", "In January, Platts expanded its energy information platform by acquiring BENTEK Energy. This is widely recognized as the leading provider of fundamental data and analytics to the natural gas market in North America.  And on July 1, we acquired the Steel Business Briefing Group, a leading provider of news, pricing and analytics to the global steel market. With world steel consumption projected to increase by approximately 60% during the next decade, this acquisition creates excellent new opportunities for Platts. And with these new additions, Platts is now even better positioned as a leading provider of critical news, pricing and analytical services. ", "There are other early milestones to report in our portfolio review. On June 14, we announced that we are pursuing the sale of our Broadcasting Group. This business consists of ABC affiliates in the attractive Denver, San Diego, Indianapolis and Bakersfield, California markets, as well as 5 TV Azteca America affiliates in California and Colorado. There has been a very strong response to our announcement from financial and nonfinancial buyers. Based on the level of interest and the quality of firms that we're now engaging with, we are very optimistic about the outcome of this process. ", "Our decision to sell the Broadcasting Group is a window into our review process. Broadcasting has been a part of the company -- an important part of the company, for 40 years. We have nurtured this business, and it has made a solid contribution to our bottom line. But as we examined our enterprise and assessed the future, we determined that the Broadcasting Group does not have the characteristics we define as core. It lacks scale. It's cyclical. It's advertising-based, and the growth prospects seem somewhat limited. As a result, it became a candidate for divestiture. We also believe this action is better for our associates in the broadcasting business as they hopefully will be a part of an organization with greater capability in this space. ", "Before reviewing our business segments, I want to touch on 2 additional topics: first, is our commitment to use our strong cash flow and balance sheet to return capital to shareholders; and the other is the vastly improving legal and regulatory environment in which we are now operating. ", "We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. From 1996 to the first half of 2011, we have returned $10.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. ", "When it comes to paying dividends, the McGraw-Hill Companies is exceptional. We are one of only 25 corporations in the S&P 500 that has increased dividends annually for each of the past 38 years. Our current annualized rate of $1 per share represents an average compound annual dividend rate of 9.8% since 1974. As for stock buybacks, I am sure you are aware that on June 29, our Board of Directors approved a new repurchase authorization of up to 50 million shares, that's 17% of the total shares outstanding. In the first half of this year, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for $300 million at an average price of $38.96.  ", "As some have recently observed, legal and regulatory concerns facing the rating agencies are continuing to abate. I am pleased to report that our latest count shows 21 lawsuits have been dismissed in their entirety, and another 9 have been voluntarily withdrawn. 5 dismissals by lower courts have now been reaffirmed by higher courts. ", "The recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is a significant victory for S&P in subprime litigation since this category has attracted the most lawsuits.  In affirming the dismissal of 3 underwriter cases filed against Standard & Poor's and other rating agencies, the panel of judges' unanimous decision is unambiguous, in concluding that credit rating agencies cannot be sued as underwriters. In view of this favorable ruling, our attorneys believe it will be very difficult for any future plaintiff to bring a new underwriter claim against Standard & Poor's. ", "We have also received earlier this month a significant ruling on the Parmalat case, which has been in the Italian court since 2005. The court in Milan rejected, in its entirety, Parmalat's principal claims for damages of more than EUR 4 billion. The court also ruled that Standard & Poor's breached its rating agreement and will have to return rating fees and pay some attorney and expert fees, a total of about $1 million, even though Parmalat repeatedly provided false and misleading information to Standard & Poor's in the entire period that it was under contract, and that massive and systematic fraud resulted in criminal convictions of several of the company's former executives. ", "This ruling comes at a time when there's been criticism in Europe of Standard & Poor's sovereign ratings and calls by some politicians to place new limits on rating agencies. While the issue has not confined to S&P, it is important to note that these suggestions are being sharply criticized. We believe these criticisms are misguided, and we think the Financial Times' influential Lex column said it best when it noted and I quote, \"Eurozone politicians and the European Central Bank should thank Standard & Poor's for telling the truth.\" More recently, a special report by a committee of the House of Lords on the euro debt crisis called suggestions to suspend ratings for countries in international financial assistant programs, \"wholly impractical and smacks of censorship.\" ", "We're encouraged that transparency and the importance of objective third-party opinion for investors are highly valued. That's evidenced in the United States where the Dodd-Frank Act is just over a year old. At yesterday's hearings before the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation, S&P pointed out the significant actions and investments that it has taken in recent years to improve transparency, quality and the timeliness of its ratings and to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act. Real progress is being made. ", "Okay, with that said, let me turn now to the operating results, and let's begin with McGraw-Hill Financial. We have already touched on the key measures of this segment's second quarter performance, 13.5% revenue growth, 17.3% increase in operating profit. Clearly, our new segment is on the right track with first half revenue growth of 14.8% and a 29.5% operating margin. Subscriptions produced 74% of the segment revenue and grew by 15.8% in the first half. ", "We are making very good progress in integrating our businesses. We are building scale in core franchises. We are leveraging our market position for further expansion with new enhancements and products. For example, through an integration of S&P Indices' unique methodologies with Compustat and Capital IQ's fundamental data, we launched a new package -- a new data package, that offers more than 100 Index-level statistics focused on income statements, balance sheets and trading data. ", "The S&P fundamental data package represents one example of a series of planned offerings based on the collaboration and integration of capabilities and assets across McGraw-Hill Financial. Our deep fundamental information on S&P 500 constituents makes it easier for clients to benchmark, back test and execute investment strategies. ", "We are also enhancing our Capital IQ consensus offering to include the industry's first aggregate estimates tied directly to share counts for S&P 500 companies, as well as reporting daily during earnings seasons on trends and outliers. As we evolve and introduce new and innovative data and analytic offerings, we will also continue to improve our broad portfolio of existing products and services by leveraging the scale and strength of the new McGraw-Hill Financial. So to sum up, expansion continues, and we expect a solid first half from McGraw-Hill Financial to be followed by a solid second half performance. ", "Let's move over to Standard & Poor's. Surging new issue volume, a booming bank loan market, low interest rates, investor demand for yield and strong refinancing activity combined for an outstanding second quarter at Standard & Poor's despite a decline in public finance markets and softness in Structured Finance. In the second quarter, revenue increased by 18.6%. Operating profit increased by 17.3%. The operating margin of 44.3% compares to 44.8% for the same period last year. ", "Some of the challenging expense comparisons that were evident in the first quarter, increasing compensation and regulatory costs, were still a factor in the second quarter. First half comparisons were particularly difficult this year because of the timing of incremental costs for compliance. Most of the increase in 2010 occurred in the second half. In 2011, expenses, which will increase from $12 million to $15 million, will be more evenly spread, which will help second half comparisons. ", "Investment in resources to support strong growth in our corporate and government's group, as well as CRISIL businesses, are primary drivers of expense growth, along with investment in infrastructure and new resources to support compliance with regulatory requirements. Foreign exchange also contributed to the growth in expenses as well. ", "We continue to watch events in the market relating to the sovereign debt situation and the debate on the United States debt ceiling. While there are uncertainties and an expectation of month-to-month volatility at this time, our view is with easier cost comparisons and the continuation of favorable market conditions, we see the potential for a solid second half performance from Standard & Poor's. ", "Let's review some of the reasons for our confidence in the second half outlook. Corporations continue to borrow for expansion even as earnings remain strong and cash builds on the balance sheet. Low default rate expectations and low yields on less risky debt should keep investors interested in the high yield and leverage loan markets for the balance of the year. M&A activity, a key driver of new bond issuance, is obviously picking up. Public markets will continue to benefit from the bank disintermediation in Europe, and refinancing activity remains strong. ", "According to S&P's leveraged commentary and data group, 56% of the proceeds from high-yield bonds were used for refinancing in the second quarter. The amount of maturing debt increases significantly through 2015, and that's according to a new study issued by Standard & Poor's earlier this month. S&P estimates that $8 trillion of debt, $8 trillion of debt, will mature from the second quarter of 2011 through the end of 2015. About $1.4 trillion comes due in 2011. Next year, more than $2 trillion of corporate debt will mature. ", "We continue to remain optimistic about the potential for the Structured Finance market. The asset-backed sector is stabilizing. There are modest increases in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market and the collateralized debt obligation market, strengthening our criteria to enhance stability, transparency, comparability and become more forward looking may have led to some decline in share, but positions us well for the future. As issuance picks up in the Structured Finance and the need to invest in our regulatory framework declines, margin improvement should be expected. So summing up for Standard & Poor's, a solid first half performance and sustained top and bottom line growth in the second half despite some market volatility. ", "Let's look at McGraw-Hill Education. Normally, there is concern in the second quarter about orders being pulled forward to the third quarter; not this year. Delays in ordering affected both state new adoption and open territory revenue as potential sales shifted from the second quarter into the third quarter and possibly even into the fourth quarter. ", "Second quarter comparisons were also affected by the McGraw-Hill School Education's strong results last year, and that was in the Texas reading and literature adoptions. These were important factors in the 10.1% decline in McGraw-Hill School Education Group second quarter revenue. ", "From McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Professional and International Group, revenue increased 1.8% as digital products and services grew at a double-digit rate in a seasonally-slow quarter. As a result, McGraw-Hill Education's revenue declined by 5% in the second quarter and operating income was off by 18.3%. The timing of sales and growth of digital products are key to our second half prospects this year in the education market, which we think are good. We have greatly -- we have greater clarity in this year's elementary, high school market now that Texas has appropriated $399 million for new instruction material programs plus another $393 million for the purchase of-previously-adopted materials covered by continuing contracts. ", "Earlier this year, we said Texas funding was the wildcard in the 2011 state new adoption market. The issue was not settled until the Texas State Legislature completed a special session, and that was on June 29. Consequently, there were no orders from Texas in May, June or July. Not until August 8 will the Texas Education Agency begin the process -- processing orders from local school districts. With Texas now on the record, we believe the state new adoption market could equal or surpass last year's $850 million to $875 million level. If so, the total elementary, high school market could be flat or modestly up in 2011. ", "State budgets remain under pressure but there are some indication that state cuts in education spending will be deeper for higher education than K-12. It is easier politically to cut higher education funding because colleges and universities can raise tuition and make other adjustments more easily than public schools, where most of the education budget is devoted to salaries and related pension and healthcare costs. ", "There are also indications that some states may restore K-12 funding if their revenues continue to improve. That has already happened, for example, in Michigan. The uncertainty over how much funding would be available in Texas and the possibility that some categories may not be funded at all, led us to focus our participation on about half of the state's expensive adoption call for 2011. ", "Under the circumstances, making heavy investments creates state-specific products necessary to match the Texas standards and meet district demands was too problematic. For the same economic reasons, we elected not to participate in the Florida K-5 science adoption. We still expect to capture approximately 30% of the state new adoption market in which we are participating this year because some opportunities did not warrant the investment, we will participate in a little over 70% of the total markets. ", "Our investment in digital opportunities are gaining traction. In the school market, our-- all-digital cloud-based K-12 science program, we call this program the McGraw-Hill CINCH Learning,  was approved by Texas for this year's special science adoption. Students can access our content on any tablet, computer or mobile device they choose. Strong double-digit growth increases in the sales of digital products and services were key to McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Professional and International's 1.8% revenue growth in the second quarter. ", "The rapid acceptance of digital products is transforming the higher education market. The response to McGraw-Hill Connect, that's our homework management and study system, has been outstanding because it improved the workflow for both faculty and students. McGraw-Hill Connect seamlessly integrates into the widely-used Blackboard learning management system for quick and easy access. Importantly, McGraw-Hill Connect and other homework management products represent a new revenue stream for us. Unlike textbooks, which are purchased by students but selected by instructors, these products can be earmarked directly to students. ", "Acquisitions have also added new talent and products that strengthens our capabilities in key markets. For example, we recently acquired Tegrity. This is the Israeli software firm that is doing groundbreaking work in the education market. The firm has already created a market-leading lecture capture service in higher education, and its talented team played a key role in the development of a new service that will help speed the digital transformation of the higher education market. We call the new service McGraw-Hill Campus. ", "More than 100 higher education institutions will be using it this fall. McGraw-Hill Campus is a first of its kind service that enables us to provide universal access to our digital content tools directly from any campus portal. That means faculty and students will have true single sign-on to all of our course content and digital tools no matter what learning management system is being used on campus. ", "Our strong lineup of digital products is an important reason why we expect growth this year in the higher education market. The industry will also benefit from a modest increase in enrollments, probably in the 1% to 2% range. Growth will occur largely in the community colleges and public universities. Enrollments in the for-profit schools are expected to stabilize and build toward the end of the year. ", "The impact of rentals in this year's higher education market is still difficult to gauge. Not all college bookstores are aggressively promoting rentals and not all titles can be rented. We currently estimate that rentals will account for about 5% of the new and used book market this year. We continue to expect that the U.S. colleges and university market will grow 4% to 6% this year, although the lower end of the range now appears to be probably more likely. ", "Let's sum up for McGraw-Hill Education. In the third quarter, the elementary and high school market would benefit from delayed orders in the second quarter, and that's particularly from Texas. Higher education and professional markets will see widespread adoptions of digital products and services, which will continue to grow at double-digit rates, and we're in an excellent position to benefit from both of these trends. ", "Moving over to our Business-to-Business Group. Double-digit growth of our Business-to-Business Group was key to the Information & Media's second quarter and first half performance. B2B Group's 11.7% increase in the revenue offset a 6% decline at Broadcasting. As a result, in the second quarter, revenue for the segment was up 9.7%. Operating income was up 5.9% and the operating margin was 20.5%. Earlier this year, we said that 2010 improvement in this segment's operating margin was sustainable. With a solid first half performance now in the books, we are demonstrating the improvement is not a one-year phenomenon. ", "Our Business-to-Business Group is now primarily a subscription business delivered digitally. More than 70% of the group's revenue is digital, the result of investments and capabilities that create the foundation for developing new products and revenue streams. More than 60% of the group's revenue comes from subscriptions. ", "In the second quarter, strong demand for Platts proprietary content and growth -- proprietary content and growth in syndicated studies and consulting services at J.D. Power in automotive and non-automotive sectors were key drivers. A decrease in political advertising in a non-election year was a major factor in Broadcasting's second quarter performance. So summing up, sustainable margin improvement and an encouraging second half outlook. ", "So wrapping up my review of operations and summing up The McGraw-Hill Companies. Overall, our businesses are performing well. Based on the solid start to the year and a promising outlook for the second half, we now expect to achieve the top end of our 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance of $2.79 to $2.89. ", "Okay. With that, let me turn it over to Jack Callahan. And as Chief Financial Officer, he'll walk through -- us through the numbers. Jack?", "Jack Callahan", "Thank you, Terry. It's a pleasure to review with you a very strong quarter and a strong first half to 2010 -- 2011. Let's start by providing additional detail on several items. Our solid organic revenue growth also benefited from acquisitions, as well as foreign exchange. ", "In the second quarter, acquisitions completed over the past 12 months accelerated revenue growth by approximately 140 basis points, while the profit impact was modestly dilutive. Foreign exchange also positively impacted consolidated revenue results by approximately 160 basis points. Impact on the bottom line was minimal. Information & Media's Q2 segment expenses were impacted by a number of nonrecurring items, consisting of a write-off of deferred costs recorded in prior periods, largely offset by a gain on the sale of our interest in the LinkedIn Corporation. ", "Corporate expense was $44 million in the quarter and increased by $6.6 million from the prior year. For the first half, corporate expense was $78.4 million, an increase of 6.9%. These increases were driven by a step-up in incentive compensation due to the timing of accruals as well as improved operating results. For the full year, we continue to expect corporate expense to increase in the mid-single-digit range versus 2010 adjusted corporate expense of $164 million.  As a reminder, the 2010 expense exclude the one-time charge of $15.6 million related to subleasing excess space in the company's New York facilities. ", "Net interest expense was $20 million in Q2, a modest decline of $1 million versus prior year. We still expect full year interest to be comparable to 2010, which was $82 million. Our effective tax rate was 36.4% in the second quarter, flat versus 2010. We expect our full year effective tax rate to remain in that range. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $4.7 million, largely driven by CRISIL. ", "Let me turn now to capital allocation. We spent $426 million on acquisitions and share repurchases in the first half, $126 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. As Terry mentioned, the most notable acquisition was BENTEK Energy, which was acquired in the first quarter. Next, our acquisition of Steel Business Briefing Group closed on July 1 and will be included in our Q3 results. Both acquisitions added to Platts' growing platform, adding critical capability in the natural gas and iron ore markets. ", "We continue to actively repurchase shares. In Q2, we repurchased 4.4 million shares, a step-up from Q1 repurchases of 3.3 million shares. For the first half, we repurchased 7.7 million shares for approximately $300 million, averaging $38.96 per share. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter was 309.2 million, a 4 million decrease from the prior year. The decline is due primarily to share repurchases, which more than offset equity-related awards. ", "We continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. Before dividends, we expect to generate cash flow greater than $1 billion. After dividends, free cash flow is projected to be in excess of $700 million. Going forward, our robust free cash flow and strong balance sheet enable us to selectively add attractive, strategically-relevant businesses like BENTEK Energy and the Steel Business Briefing Group to the McGraw-Hill portfolio, while continue -- continuing to return cash to shareholders via share repurchases subject to market conditions. ", "We are extremely well capitalized, with cash and short-term investments at quarter end of $1.3 billion. The $223 million decline in cash and short-term investments from year-end 2010 is due -- is primarily due to share repurchases in the acquisitions we've mentioned. Gross debt was approximately -- was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in long-term unsecured senior notes. No commercial paper is outstanding. ", "Turning to capital investments. We now expect prepublication investment to be below $200 million versus our previous guidance of roughly $200 million to $225 million. This decline is largely due to a rescoping  of our new core reading program and some fine tuning overall financial requirements. ", "Prepublication amortization for the full year is expected to be approximately $210 million, a $36 million decline from 2010, reflecting the recent reduced level of investment.  Capital expenditures continue to be projected up to $150 million, driven in part by increased digital and technology investments. This compares to $115 million in 2010. ", "In closing, the McGraw-Hill Companies is off to a solid start, and we are on track for a very good year. To reiterate several points made by Terry, our revenue growth for the first half is the best since 2007, and we now expect to achieve the top end of our 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance of $2.79 to $2.89. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Donald Rubin for the Q&A session. Don?", "Donald Rubin", "Thank you, Jack. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Sloan Bohlen from Goldman Sachs.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "First question for Terry. I imagine you know this is the one that's coming. I wonder if you could give us some color around what significant changes you may proceed with regard to one, kind of give us an idea of the scope of some G&A cuts that you could make; and then second to that, what areas of the business you think you could make changes in.", "Harold McGraw", "Okay, Sloan, help me with that last part of your question. What kind of support we can do in terms of the businesses overall, what was that?", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So just trying to get a sense of what that means. Is it -- Does it mean additional investment in businesses? Does it mean divestiture of businesses? Kind of give us a sense of what your portfolio review entails?", "Harold McGraw", "Okay, all right. Well, actually, Sloan, as you know, this all started in 2010. We had to make sure some of the bigger issues that were influencing the corporation in terms of things like legal and regulatory and the Structured Finance revenues and some of the funding issues from state, we needed to get those sorted through.  And so as we progressed in 2010, we really focused on getting those behind us and sharpening on the expectation for execution, and that's why you saw some of the management changes and so forth. As part of all that, we also then began to look really hard at the overall portfolio in terms of where we ought to be allocating a lot of the capital and given some of the cash generation and so forth. One is that we wanted to really reinvigorate a commitment that we've always had to share repurchase, and then as well as to the dividend situation. But that also led then to the whole issue of McGraw-Hill Financial. McGraw-Hill Financial is a completely different business than Standard & Poor's. It needs its own management structure, it's an own design. It needs its own growth pattern and so forth. So integrating those businesses became a priority.  And so as we got into 2011, we needed to be running McGraw-Hill Financial,I think. And we're really, really pleased with the results in the first half of this year and what the prospects for McGraw-Hill Financial are. The second one was then starting to look at some more non-core assets, and that's what led us to the Broadcasting piece. Some of the things that we've talked about in terms of focusing on more core properties led us to really, really strengthening our initiatives on Platts, and that led to the BENTEK Energy acquisition and the Steel Business Briefing that we just announced on that one. We need to accelerate aggressively the digital transformation at the education side, and clearly, we're seeing it at the higher ed, professional, international, and we're now beginning to see it again on the K-12 side. We have to deal, obviously, with the state funding issues. And obviously, for this year, Texas, as we've said, was going to be the wildcard in all of this. The good news is that they are funding. The issue is it didn't come in May, June or July. It's going to be into the third quarter, and so we look to benefit nicely from that part. In terms of other aspects of the portfolio, the only thing that I really would say at this point, Sloan, is that again, everything is being looked at. There is an awful lot of things that are on the table right now, from a timing standpoint. I look to the second half of this year to be making some pretty significant action statements, on that part. But again, overall, we've got a very strong cash and balance sheet position. The share repurchase and dividend, we're going to continue to emphasize. We've had a strong first half. We're going to have a very strong second half, on that part. But it gives us an opportunity, having all of that, to be able to make some changes and focusing more on some of the core assets that we have. So other than saying that there's going to be more actual statements coming relatively soon, we feel very excited about the portfolio review that we've done, and it will continue, on that part. Does that -- without going into any other specifics, I mean, the actions we're taking on this one, more to come.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And Terry, maybe I'd just add one  follow-up to kind of piece out some detail. The idea that there's significant changes potentially in the second half suggests that things are in the work. Is that incremental to the sale of the broadcasting unit? Can we expect that there's things beyond that, that will be announced in the second half?", "Harold McGraw", "I think you can infer that, yes.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then maybe just one question on how we should think about the pace of share repurchase activity going forward. Is the pace that's been set out in the first half of this year a good run rate going forward? Or in the past, I know you guys have been more opportunistic given where the stock is. But maybe just give us a sense.", "Harold McGraw", "Sloan, we've got to take a look at what conditions, and all of that. The answer to your question is yes. It is to say that the step up in the first half is more of what we're looking at in the second half. But again, we will take a look at conditions as they exist, and if we think it's necessary to accelerate, we will.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Meltz, JPMorgan.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I appreciate the -- what you said about the portfolio review at the outset. Can you tell us though -- Terry, I think you said you have different work streams and I guess folks looking at things internally. Is this also -- have you engaged consultants or bankers as well with the broader analysis? That's my first question.", "Harold McGraw", "Well, the answer is yes. I mean, when we look at things, we're looking to get as much intelligence and support as we can. And so the answer is yes.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And does it also -- besides the portfolio review, which -- I think that at the end of the quarter, you had net cash of over $1 billion. Is there -- are you reassessing your comfort level with the balance sheet and maybe having a set leverage target of some sort?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes. I mean, again, dependent upon conditions and the like, I mean, those things are on constant review on this part. Making sure that -- going back to our first premise always, as we came out of 2010 and a lot of the external market factors that were influencing things and moving beyond that. The question is, is: How do you allocate more capital to your high-growth global brands, one; and two, in doing so, how do you define core, and where are you going to make those investments? The nice situation, Michael, is that we've got the wherewithal. We've got the flexibility. We've got the capacity, and we just want to make sure those allocations are going to those that are going to give us the best returns.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then a question for you on the guidance. I believe -- I got to look back but I believe last quarter, you had -- or previously, you've been giving pretty specific segment guidance. And while you're pointing to the high end of EPS range, can you tell us what the x revenue growth expectation is for the 3 segments versus the prior -- I guess, for the 4 segments versus what you had previously been pointing to?", "Harold McGraw", "No. I mean, I think that the issue for us is that the first half showed us the revenue growth expectations that we wanted. We were hoping to get to the double-digit growth. Now in all 3 segments, with the exception of Education, which is under a different kind of pressure, issues in terms of revenue growth, we saw the double-digit growth that we wanted.", "Jack Callahan", "Yes, let me give specifics by segments. There's no real change in our overall segment guidance at this point in time. So from McGraw-Hill Financial, that would be double-digit growth. Although double-digit growth for S&P, there would be high single-digit growth. Now obviously, there's always could be some potential volatility in the capital markets. Information & Media, more in the sort of the mid-single, a bit better there but we'd hold to the mid-single for right now.  And then MHE is low-single digit guidance for the full year. Obviously, that would require a pretty significant Q3 given where we are so far within the year. But we'd stand with that initial guidance right now.", "Harold McGraw", "And the other aspect here, Michael, is that again, everything is relative to the environments in which we operate.  And so as we were putting numbers together last year, we thought the $2.79, $2.89 was a very responsible platform for what we were seeing. Clearly, given the strength of the first half and some of our expectations, we can now say the upper end of that, on that part. But again, it's one that, relative to environment conditions, we want to be able to operate at the highest level we possibly can. And if it's doing better, we'll do it better.", "Michael Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then one clarification for me, please. Terry, I think to the last question -- last questioner, you had said to get to this review, you had to assess the legal situation and some of the other things that were happening. Is that  meaning -- just to understand -- to get some of the dismissals out of the way? Or is there -- to the extent you look to spin off some things or do something more significant, you might be restricted because of lawsuits that are still outstanding? I don't...", "Harold McGraw", "No, no, no. It's a very different situation. Obviously, given the turmoil in the financial markets and all of those kind of things, we were clearly influenced and clearly the stock was influenced with some of the uncertainty and the regulatory and legal situation and the like. Today, what we said -- and by the way, what we said from the very beginning is being reaffirmed, is that it's a vastly different legal and regulatory environment. We have -- we don't have anywhere near the uncertainty in the regulatory issue that you had a year ago. Both the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia have all completed those kinds of forms. Now, by the way, one that we're pushing very aggressively on and why we're focused on the G20 coming up at the end of the year is that there still needs to be an effort, and hopefully, led by the United States, to harmonize some of the financial regulation. They're not all in compliance with each other, so we need to push very aggressively on that. But the regulatory environment is vastly improved in terms of certainty and those kind of things. The legal issue, we said from the very beginning that the overall legal situation is low in all of that but you have to bear it out. Today, 30 suits have been dismissed or dropped, and we see that continuing. Most importantly, the categories that those suits were in, underwriter suits, stock drop suits and things like that, the courts have all set precedents now that those are not germane. So we don't see any additional activity on those things. But as those dark clouds go away and the earnings power and the execution capability is there, what we're focusing on now from a strategic standpoint is where we want that capital allocation to go in terms of the core assets and how we can expand faster.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "So Terry, you mentioned that perhaps you're seeing a little bit of market share pressure at S&P, and I was just hoping you might give us a little color on where you're seeing that pressure and how significantly you take that in terms of something that requires action.", "Harold McGraw", "Well, it doesn't. I mean, this is day-to-day, everyday business conditions, and you watch it, all of it, very carefully. Sometimes, in terms of how you establish criteria, what the -- who's financing what, what capabilities it takes on. There are shifts back and forth in all of that. We want to make sure that from a clarity standpoint that we're as transparent as we possibly can be about what the criteria we establish for certain instruments is and that we apply it in such a way that it's coherent to the marketplace on that part. From time to time, you'll see some share gains or reverse in all of that. But that's just normal operating conditions. The most important thing is that people have a very clear understanding of how we are viewing and assessing any particular instrument, and that they see a very clear application of that.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay. And then, Terry, with regard to the margin expectations for S&P. I mean, given the, I think, a broad expectation that revenue growth would certainly have to slow in the second half, are you confident that you can see year-to-year margin improvement at S&P in the second half, even in the context of what would likely be, I would imagine, significantly slower revenue growth?", "Harold McGraw", "Let me put it -- flip it around on that one. Given some of the cost pressures that we talked about and whether it be foreign exchange or some of the others that we've dealt with, I am personally very pleased with the margin level that we're running at right now. Quite frankly, my expectation was not where it is right now on this one. So I would say to you without getting into forecasting margin levels or whatever, you can assume that margin level that we achieved in the first half, we should be able to at least match in the second half.  And obviously, everything we're looking at is trying to improve that. But I think that for Standard & Poor's, that is a pretty good level relative to some things that we faced.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay, fair enough. And then based on that Terry, should we anticipate that the current level of margins are sort of around on the 44% level, I guess, is what you would view as an appropriate level going forward?", "Harold McGraw", "No, I wouldn't forecast yet on that part. I mean, again, as markets recover and as this business is getting all the attention that it's getting in all of that, obviously, we want to try and improve upon that. But I wouldn't forecast anything yet. I think where we are right now, I'm pleased in the first half. We're going to do everything we can to build on that.", "Jack Callahan", "The flat outlook for the balance of the year is prudent. Also, I'd just -- and even we -- the expense comparisons in the back half are a bit more favorable for us relative to last year than they were in the first half of this year. So and it's still too early to comment on next year.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay. And then one last thing. Terry, you said participation in 70% of adoptions this year. And I think that's sort of a strategic change because in the past, I believe you've been very broad-based in terms of your participation.", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, you're exactly right, Peter. You should think and given the fact that states have been healthier in the past and funding is more predictable and all of those kind of thing, we tend to have been in near 100%, 95% to 100% anyway, of the market opportunity. This year, and this came out a part of the strategic study that was initiated last year, our decision is that on some of the smaller disciplines, that we were not going to participate, and we're not just going to be in every single thing. Getting -- making sure that in terms of reading, math, science, those are very core disciplines that you have to have high competency in. And some of the others, we'll be very selective in terms of where we're going to allocate capital.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber, Access 342.", "Craig Huber - ", "My first question just on education. What is your outlook? Just to elaborate a little bit further here, for the open territories for this full year? And can you talk a little bit further about -- on the adoption market you're expecting there?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, the good picture overall, Craig, is that the comment that we made coming in into this year, is that we thought the state adoption market -- I mean, and I think a good story, is that the state adoption market would equal or do a little bit better than 2010, and that all was dependent upon obviously Texas being the biggest part of this year. When we saw the state legislature in Texas wandering a little bit in terms of funding initiatives, it concerned us obviously, on that part. The fact that they have now come out and are going to fund and fund at the levels that they're funding and into the third quarter, that makes this a much better year. So last year, the $858 million, $875 million range, I think we'll definitely do that, and we might even do better than that. Open territory is again spotty. I mean, it's sort of like looking at numbers for the EU or something. You've got so many different countries with different growth prospects. You can come up with an average but some states are doing a little bit better in the open territory area, but then you have some outliers as well. But overall, I would say the situation is clearly improving.", "Craig Huber - ", "And also on the S&P ratings front, I mean, given how poor public finance debt issuance has been in the first 6 months of the year, are you expecting that to materially pick up here in the back half of the year?", "Harold McGraw", "That's -- obviously, that is one that we're watching very carefully because of the health of the states and the influences, lots of other decisions as well. I mean, in terms of activity levels, we're starting to see some activity on this. But I'm still a little bit guarded on that. I wish we were seeing a little bit more at this point. But I would certainly hope that the second half and certainly 2012 begins to show a very different picture than what we saw in the first half of this year.", "Jack Callahan", "Yes. To be specific on this year, our outlook is fairly conservative for the balance of the year. We're not banking on any material improvements relative to our outlook right now.", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, but Craig, that's one for all of us, that we need to see some improvement.", "Craig Huber - ", "Also Terry, if I could ask, your outlook for the Structured Finance market, what signs are you looking for to potentially help that out here off of a very low base?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, this is one that's definitely improving, on that one. We have seen a little bit more strength, obviously in more of the plain vanilla side of the structured market in terms of asset-backed securities. We're seeing more activity in Europe. We're seeing the commercial mortgage-backed market showing some signs. So it's definitely improving. I mean, if anybody wants to talk about the residential mortgage-backed market, no, you're not seeing any pickup in activity there. But in terms of ABS and CMBS and so on , yes, you're starting to see some here and in Europe.", "Operator", "That was our final question. That concludes this morning's call.

Terry?", "Harold McGraw", "Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Don, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me this morning is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. I've also asked Lou Eccleston, President of McGraw-Hill Financial to join us. Lou will review the results in the new McGraw-Hill Financial segment, and he'll also address some of the steps that he is taking to streamline that structure and create value-added solutions for future growth. Also in future meetings, we'll continue to include other senior managers so that you can hear directly from them. Certainly we'll have Doug Peterson, the recently appointed President of Standard & Poor's; Glenn Goldberg, President of Information & Media, and other senior managers to address key aspects of our operations. ", "This morning, Jack and I will review the third quarter results and the outlook for the balance of the year. We're also providing an update on our Growth and Value Plan, including the cost reduction target, our accelerated share repurchase program and the sale of our broadcasting business. ", "On balance, our business performed well in the third quarter and this is despite some very challenging market conditions. We benefited from strong double-digit revenue and profit growth at McGraw-Hill Financial, and we're pleased with the solid performance of our Information & Media segment, where revenue grew by nearly 12% on a continuing basis. ", "Standard & Poor's Ratings and McGraw-Hill Education both experienced significant headwinds, which affected our overall performance in the third quarter. For Standard & Poor's Ratings, the challenge really was market volatility and the sharp decline in the new issue market. For McGraw-Hill Education, the challenge was the decline in the elementary-high school market, marked by low purchasing for state new adoption instruction materials. And here, despite these challenges, earnings per share from continuing operations in the third quarter was $1.21, the same as on an adjusted basis as last year. Revenue declined slightly to $1.9 billion in the third quarter and that's compared to $2 billion last year. Earnings per diluted share on an adjusted basis for the first 9 months increased by 6.3% to $2.27, and revenue grew by 3.3% to $4.7 billion. ", "Uncertainty in global credit markets and the ongoing challenges in education make us a bit cautious about the near-term outlook, but despite market volatility, we expect to finish the year well and within our current 2011 guidance of $2.81 to $2.86 per diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, and that compares to adjusted earnings per share of $2.68 in 2010. ", "Our results also highlight the logic of the recent announcement to separate The McGraw-Hill Companies into 2 public companies, and this is all a part of our Growth and Value Plan that we've put out. In this slide, there's a snapshot of the financial performance in the third quarter and year-to-date of what will become our Markets company. By the third quarter, these businesses produced revenue of $970.7 million, which is a 7.7% increase from prior year and the operating profit of $333 million or a 7.6% increase on an adjusted basis. And on a year-to-date basis, the businesses in McGraw-Hill Markets produced revenue of $2.9 billion, 11.7% more than prior period, and operating profit of $1.1 billion, a 12.1% increase from the comparable 2010 adjusted results. And these strong results do not reflect the benefits that we will also be able to capture when these businesses are combined into one streamlined operating company. ", "Okay, with that as a start, let's turn to our segment results and let's get into a little bit more detail. We'll start with McGraw-Hill Financial, which under the leadership of Lou Eccleston produced the strongest quarterly revenue and operating profit growth of the year in the third quarter. And as we've mentioned before, establishing McGraw-Hill Financial was the first step towards the Growth and Value Plan, and the organization is fully in line with the Growth and Value Plan's primary purpose, which is to unlock value for shareholders by harnessing the power of great brands, leading-edge technology and first rate intellectual capital. In its short life, McGraw-Hill Financial has established an impressive track record. Simply put, McGraw-Hill Financial represents a more effective way to monetize our considerable intellectual capital, proprietary data and analytics. As such, it serves investment bankers, commodity traders, lenders, broker-dealers and others in the way they want and the way they need to be served. But at this point, let me ask Lou to review the results and give us a little bit of the outlook for McGraw-Hill Financial. ", "Lou?", "Lou Eccleston", "Okay. Thanks, Terry. As Terry said, we had an excellent quarter, delivering an 18.4% increase in revenue and a 31.2% increase in operating profit. Revenue for the quarter was $348.5 million and operating profit reached $112.6 million. Our operating margin was 32.3%. Year-to-date revenue topped $1 billion for the period, showing a year-over-year increase of 16%, while operating profit increased by 27.6% for the same period to $306.7 million. Operating margin for the 9-month period was also up to 30.5%. ", "McGraw-Hill Financial's strongest quarterly performance to date really reflects the successful execution of our innovative operating model, which Terry referred to. This has allowed us to successfully integrate our businesses, capitalize quickly on market opportunities and even further benefit from market dynamics such as the continued growth of ETF products that are based on various S&P Indices. ", "Market volatility during the third quarter contributed to a more than 30% increase in S&P Indices revenue. The average daily trading volume of major exchange-based derivative contracts based on the S&P Indices soared by 58.5%. Assets under management in ETFs that are linked to our indices grew by 6.8% and that's up to nearly $280 billion. ETF providers introduced 11 new products that were based on S&P Indices in the third quarter, bringing the number of ETFs trading on S&P Indices to 359. S&P Indices overall accounted for about 25% of McGraw-Hill Financial's revenue. ", "Also significantly contributing to our successful quarter was the accelerated sales and market share growth of S&P Capital IQ and the Global Credit Portal which, along with the integration of TheMarkets.com, helped drive a 15.6% increase in subscription revenue. Subscriptions tend to provide stable and predictable revenue streams, and that amounted to $251.8 million for us in the third quarter. ", "Overall for McGraw-Hill Financial, subscriptions accounted for more than 72% of our third quarter revenue. ", "We also continued building out the S&P Capital IQ platform to include more content and analytics from across all of McGraw-Hill Financial, and we continued expanding globally, ending the third quarter with more than 3,800 clients, and this is nearly an 18% increase from a year earlier. ", "In addition to our platforms, Enterprise Solutions continued expanding its integrated coverage, again across all McGraw-Hill Financial proprietary data assets, as well as adding third-party data and information and that led to strong year-over-year sales growth for Enterprise Solutions. ", "So in summary, the expectation that was expressed on the second quarter that McGraw-Hill Financial would in fact continue on a solid growth strip trajectory is bearing out and we do anticipate a strong 2011 finish. ", "Now importantly, this slide demonstrates what we can achieve when we maximize the capabilities of our entire portfolio of assets through an operating model that allows us to leverage infrastructure and more quickly and effectively combine assets to create new solutions, and that allows us to create solutions that offer high-value, differentiated offerings. This model reflects a discipline approach to technology and data infrastructure. And at the foundation of this is what you see at the bottom of the slide. This allows for faster, more prolific and innovative packaging of products, services, content and analytics across all asset classes and for a broad range of customers. ", "Let me give you an example. Leveraging this global and flexible infrastructure has allowed us to quickly launch localized versions of the Global Credit Portal in Russia, China and Japan all in the last 8 months. Providing solutions with local data sets and in local languages has driven new sales and faster growth and without requiring significant new investments. ", "Another great example is the creation of S&P Indices fundamental data package. This supplies S&P Indices unique and widely accepted index-level aggregation methodology, and that has been nursed by Compustat and Capital IQ fundamental data. This solution offers more than 100 index-level statistics focused on income statements, balance sheets and trading data items. So with the launch of this package, Capital IQ and Compustat become the global fundamental data source for all published statistics on S&P Indices. ", "The success of our efforts and the implementation of this new operating model really underscores the business logic and the economic incentive to unlock value behind the creation of McGraw-Hill Markets. As we grow, we will build economies of scale that allow us to leverage and maximize the value of content and analytics across all of our different businesses and markets, that'll allow us to create innovative new solutions that will help investors, our clients, face the new challenges of today's volatile and changing market landscape. ", "Thanks, and now back to Terry.", "Harold McGraw", "Okay. Well, very exciting and obviously much more to come. Thank you, Lou. ", "Okay, let's now take a look at the performance of Standard & Poor's Ratings. In anticipation of market volatility, we have over the years diversified the S&P business by building a durable non-transaction revenue stream and expanding globally. We benefited from that strategy again in the third quarter. With non-transaction revenue growing by 9.5% and international revenue increasing by 9.1%, Standard & Poor's Ratings was largely able to offset a 19.5% decline in transaction revenue in the third quarter, and that's why Standard & Poor's revenue decreased by only 1.8% in this period despite the market volatility and despite a steep decline in global new issue volume for investment grade and high-yield bonds. New issue dollar volume in the U.S. high-yield market dropped by 68% in the third quarter, investment-grade dollar volume declined by 36%, European corporate issuance was down by nearly 60%, and high-yield issuance fell by more than 76%. And obviously, these are not good issuance numbers after some very strong issuance in the first half of this year. But we also made good on our promise to rein in costs in the second half of the year. Excluding a $7.3 million pretax gain on the sale of certain equity interests in India last year, expenses grew by only 1.4% in the third quarter and that's compared to a 19.3% increase in the first half of 2011. That tight grip on costs helped to hold the decline in the operating profit in the third quarter to 6.1%, and that compared to an adjusted results for the same period last year. We will continue to keep a tight grip on these costs in the fourth quarter. ", "Uncertainty and volatility will continue to be factors for the balance of the year, but there also is a very positive demand for investment-grade corporate debt. Refinancing will continue to contribute to volume in fourth quarter. Bank lending will continue to be constrained, which will benefit bond issuance. Structured finance will continue to be soft. The bank loan ratings market still looks very promising, but spreads remain wide and that will be a key factor in any fourth quarter pickup in new issue volume. ", "Okay with that, let me update you on the legal and regulatory matters. Since our last report, the number of lawsuits that have been dismissed outright has grown to 23; 9 have been voluntarily withdrawn and 7 dismissals by lower court have now been affirmed by higher courts. ", "Yesterday, the previous dismissal of 2 stock drop lawsuits was affirmed by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The decision concerns the Gearren and Sullivan ERISA lawsuits brought against McGraw-Hill, our Board of Directors and several executives. The Court of Appeals ruled that the facts alleged that by the plaintiffs, even if proven, were insufficient to establish a cause of action. ", "Another motion to dismiss a case against Standard & Poor's was granted last month by a federal court in Ohio. The lawsuit had been initiated by the Ohio Attorney General's Office in 2009 and that was on behalf of the Ohio pension funds in connection with structured finance securities rated by Standard & Poor's. The court held that the complaint failed to demonstrate the existence of any legal duty by S&P to the Ohio funds or any actionable misrepresentation in S&P's publication of rating opinions concerning these securities. ", "Last week, we resolved the lawsuit brought by the Connecticut Attorney General's Office in 2008 in connection with S&P's Ratings regarding public finance bonds. Under the settlement agreement, S&P does not admit any liability or violation of law. S&P will give the state a credit against future rating fees and make a presentation at no charge on municipal bonds to Connecticut officials. We look forward to continuing to provide transparent ratings on public bonds issued by the State of Connecticut, as well as any other public debt issuers. ", "In New Mexico, a federal court denied our motion to dismiss a complaint alleging violations of that state's security laws and that was in connection with ratings issued on certain mortgage pass-through certificates. We have not received the court's rationale for its decision, but are prepared to demonstrate in later proceedings that the complaint lacks factual as well as legal merit. ", "In Australia, we are involved in a trial before a judge with the plaintiff looking to recover losses stemming from an investment in Constant Proportion Debt Obligation. We have pointed out to the court that the plaintiffs were not even permitted to purchase the instrument under their own mandates and that they did not know or attempt to understand what a rating meant when they made their investment. The trial is scheduled to last through the end of the year and the court may not issue a ruling here until next spring. ", "As we also announced, we received a Wells Notice on September 22 from the SEC, notifying us that the staff is considering recommending that the Commission institute a civil proceeding against Standard & Poor's. The issue involves the rating in 2007 of a single collateralized debt obligation, a CDO known as the Delphinus. Informed observers know that the Wells Notice is neither a formal allegation nor a finding of wrongdoing. It allows the S&P the opportunity to address the issues raised by the staff before it decides whether or not to make a recommendation to the Commission or before a decision is reached by the SEC. We have been cooperating with the Commission in this matter, and we continue to do so. We have seen some speculation about this situation in the media, but we're not in a position to set that record straight at this point until we get through that. ", "In the CalPERS case, the court is scheduled to hear concluding arguments and that will be coming up on October 28 on whether CalPERS has met its burden under California law to move this case to another state. ", "And as far as the regulatory landscape, we're keeping pace with those changes and we'll continue to keep you updated on any further developments there. We expect, by the way, to successfully complete the registration process in Europe and that will be in the next few weeks. ", "You may also have read about plans in the media to launch a new European rating agency. We welcome competition because the market benefits from a diversity of opinions on credit risk, that as long as they're independent, transparent and comparable across asset classes and geographies, we believe our ultimate success will be based on the value investors derive from the ratings and research produced by our 1,300 analysts worldwide. ", "On September 30, the SEC staff issued a report on its examination of each of the national recognized statistical rating agencies, NRSROs, and that's also mandated by the Dodd-Frank legislation. The report highlights several areas for improvement, but also recognizes the many changes that we have made in recent years. The key point or the takeaway is no material regulatory deficiency was found. ", "Given that, let's now turn to the Information & Media segment. This segment's revenue from continuing operations increased by nearly 12% to $228.5 million in the third quarter. Operating profit was $51.3 million and that's a 17.1% increase from last year, and the operating margin for the third quarter was 22.4%. For the 9-month period, segment revenue increased by 11.4% and operating profit increased nearly 18% to $139 million, with an operating margin of 21.1%. ", "These figures reflect the reclassification of the Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation as a result of its pending sale. Information & Media concludes Platts, which had a 25% increase in revenue in the third quarter. The increase includes contributions from the recent acquisitions of BENTEK, as well as Steel Business Briefing earlier in this year. ", "In the third quarter, Platts accounted for almost 50% of the segment's $228.5 million in revenue. Volatility in global energy prices continues to generate demand for Platts' news and pricing assessments, and that plays a vital role in energy and commodity markets. Platts continues to expand its suite of price assessments, and again we're talking some 8,500 price assessments and benchmarks daily. In the third quarter, it added weekly assessments, 5 polymers imported into Brazil and key to manufacturing of film and plastics in Latin America. Brazil is a rapidly growing player in the global petrochemical market. In the changing world of commodities, the assessments reflect the open market spot value of the polymers delivered to the key ports in Brazil. That change represents an important growth opportunity for Platts because as markets become more sophisticated, there is new demand for price discovery that Platts is well positioned to deliver.", "J.D. Power and Associates also had solid results in the third quarter. Two keys to their growth: increased demand for J.D. Power's benchmark research data on the U.S. automotive market; as well as the expansion of the firm's global business and especially in China. ", "That wraps up our look at the businesses that would comprise McGraw-Hill Markets. And again, what McGraw-Hill Markets led, that would be a 7.7% increase in revenue in the third quarter and operating profit of 7.6% and year-to-date, 11.7% revenue on 12.1% operating profit. ", "Now let's take a look at McGraw-Hill Education. As you know, the third quarter is the biggest revenue quarter for the el-hi [elementary-high school] instructional materials market and that's true this year, too. But unfortunately for the industry, it proved to be a weaker quarter than originally projected. ", "Across the country, school districts postponed or limited purchasing, citing tight budgets and concerns that further budget cuts might be coming. We don't have industry data for September yet, but the latest AAP numbers, that's the Association of American Publishers' report, shows that overall sales in the el-hi market were down by 15.6% through August. Open territory sales were down by 4.6%, while adoption state sales declined by 24.5%. This last number should improve as additional orders from Texas are reported, but it also reflects lower purchasing levels than usual in many of the adoption states where ordering for the year is largely completed. We now estimate that total 2011 state new adoption market at approximately $720 million, and that's a decline of about 17% from last year. ", "The Texas situation for 2011 obviously was key to understanding both the industry data and the third quarter performance and certainly for us at McGraw-Hill School Education Group, where revenue of $420.4 million represented a decrease of 21.4% from prior year quarter. As we've been saying for more than a year, Texas was the wildcard in 2011 market. The state had issued an adoption call for various subjects in the K-12 language arts plus prekindergarten supplemental science. However, there were months of debate about which subject categories, if any, would actually get funding. Finally, late in June, a special session of the Texas Legislature approved funding for all categories. It also enacted a new system for instructional material purchasing. Under this system, each district receives an allotment, sort of like a block grant, based on its school population or its student population. The district can then decide which state adopted material it wishes to buy. It can use the money for various other purposes and it can save unspent funds for future needs. The state's order processing site opened on August 8 and to date, it appears that the allotment system will have a more dampening effect on district implementation. That is, districts will spend less than they did under the old system when they typically bought a book per student in a newly adopted subject. For McGraw-Hill, the funding uncertainty in Texas funding posed publishing questions for us. We developed Texas versions of programs in several call categories, but decided to bypass the largest call, which was a K-5 language arts program. Producing that major print program with the required Texas-specific content would have meant a substantial investment in materials that could not be sold elsewhere if funding fell through. ", "Instead, we decided to make our big investment in a forward-looking product for the state's digital science call. Our CINCH -- that's C-I-N-C-H, our CINCH Science is a comprehensive cloud-based instructional system and this was for grades 5 through 12. With all digital content, it could easily be adapted for other markets and in fact, it is being rolled out more widely now. Fortunately, funding was approved and CINCH Science is leading its Texas competition by a wide margin. As a digital subscription product, it will not produce the high first-year sales that print titles do but on the other hand, it will also provide steady revenue recognition over the entire life of this adoption. ", "Cost considerations are accounted for our decision but not to produce a customized print program for Florida's K-5 science adoption. In 2010, our school education group competed for 97% of total available dollars in the state new adoption market and we captured a share of about 30%. This year, we made the decision to participate in approximately 75% of state new adoption opportunities, and we expect to capture about 25% of the total available dollars and 33% of the available dollars in the markets where we're competing. ", "Although the third quarter is less significant in the testing market, we saw a growth in custom contract revenue, as well as new business and strong renewals for our Acuity formative assessment product. ", "At the McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Professional and International Group, third quarter revenue was $516.9 million, and that's a decline of less than 1% from prior year quarter. We don't have official static -- statistics yet, but regional surveys and other sources indicate that higher education enrollments for the current fourth -- fall term have not matched the strong growth seen at the start of the last 2 academic years. In fact, enrollments are estimated to be flat with 2010 across the 2-year and 4-year colleges. Sharp enrollment declines have been reported in the for-profit postsecondary market, where many schools are tightening their admissions policies in order to improve graduation rates and student outcomes as required under the new federal guidelines. Despite the enrollment picture, McGraw-Hill Higher Education saw net sales increased over the third quarter of last year for 3 of its 4 main product lines and that includes career education. We lost ground in only one and that was in the Humanities, Social Sciences and Languages product group, which includes many textbooks for first year courses. ", "We also saw a double-digit growth for our Higher Education digital products. The response of instructors and students to Connect which is, as you'll recall, our innovative homework management platform, and LearnSmart, which is our computer-adapted tutorial system, has been very positive. Sales of these products are expected to increase during the fourth quarter as more and more students register to use them. We now have about 2.5 million registered users for our homework management products and we expect that number to reach close to 3 million by year-end. ", "In Professional markets, combined print and e-book sales showed improvement over the prior year quarter and that was helped by the release of a new edition of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. Revenue generated by our digital subscription products such as AccessMedicine grew at a double-digit rate. ", "And finally, our International markets achieved overall growth during the quarter as gains in the Middle East, Canada and Europe offset lower results in Asia and Australia. Higher Education performed particularly well in the Middle East, where we developed and delivered numerous custom titles for Saudi Arabia. ", "Okay, that completes our reviews of the operations. Let me turn it over now to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, and he'll give us an update on the key financials. ", "Jack?", "Jack F. Callahan", "Thank you, Terry. I wanted to briefly provide some additional detail. Let's start off with a wrap up of operating performance. Overall, the performance our 2 businesses was quite different in the quarter. Despite significant decline in global credit markets which directly impacts S&P Ratings, the Markets business had solid revenue and operating profit growth of approximately 8%. This demonstrates the strength and breadth of this business and the benefits of acquisitions completed over the past 12 months. We are pleased with the early performance of these important additions to the Markets portfolio like BENTEK, Steel Business Briefing and TheMarkets.com. Foreign exchange was also favorable, benefiting revenue by approximately $15 million or approximately 170 basis points. On the other hand, as Terry just reviewed, the Education business in the all-important third quarter was down approximately 11% in both revenue and operating profits. The decline in the top line was driven by the U.S. el-hi segment as the balance of the portfolio was largely flat. On a year-to-date basis, the performance of Markets is even stronger, with revenue and profit growth -- of revenue growth approximately 12%, with margins close to 35%. ", "Overall, this business is well positioned for future growth especially as the global credit markets stabilize in return. Revenues in Education on a year-to-date basis are down approximately 8% and profit down approximately 18%, well below our incoming expectations for the year. ", "Corporate expense was $41 million in the quarter and decreased by $3.5 million from the prior year primarily due to a decreased incentive-related compensation, essentially flat headcount and tight cost controls. Year-to-date, corporate expense was $119 million and increased just over 1%. For the full year, we expect limited increase in corporate expense. We now anticipate growth in the low single digits versus 2010 adjusted corporate expense of $164 million. As a reminder, the 2010 expense excludes the one-time charge of $15.6 million related to subleasing excess space the company's New York facilities. ", "Consolidated adjusted operating profit was $607 million, down 2% versus last year. For the full year, adjusted operating profit is approaching $1.2 billion, up 4% from last year. Net interest was $18 million in Q3, a modest decline versus prior year. Our effective tax rate was 36.3% in the third quarter, flat versus last year. With the reclassification of Broadcasting into discontinued operations, our effective tax rate in both periods declined modestly by 10 basis points. We expect our full year effective tax rate to remain in that range. After this call, we will post to our Investor Relations website a reconciliation of our current reporting to previously reported results, which had Broadcasting as part of Information & Media. ", "Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased to $8.3 million, largely driven by the continuing strong performance of CRISIL. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter was 303.6 million, a 5.6 million decrease from the prior year, a 5.5 million decrease from the second quarter. The decline is due primarily to our continuing share repurchase program which more than offset equity-related awards. ", "Now I'll turn to cash flow. We continue to expect another year of strong cash flow. Before dividends, we expect to generate cash flow greater than $1 billion. After dividends, free cash flow is now projected to be roughly $750 million. ", "Turning to capital investments. We now expect prepublication investment to be approximately $175 million versus $151 million in 2010. Prepublication amortization for the full year is expected to be approximately $205 million, a $41 million decline from 2010, reflecting the recent reduced level of investment. Capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $125 million. This compares to $115 million in 2010. ", "Turning now to capital allocation. We spent $854 million on acquisitions and share repurchases in the first 9 months: almost $200 million for acquisitions, $655 million for share repurchases. The most notable acquisitions where BENTEK Energy and Steel Business Briefing Group; both acquisitions added to Platts growing platform, adding critical capability in natural gas and iron ore markets. As I mentioned earlier, both businesses are performing well and they're becoming appropriately integrated into the Platts business. ", "We continue to actively repurchase shares. In Q3, we repurchased 9 million shares for $355 million, a significant step up from the 4.4 million shares repurchased in Q2. Year-to-date, we repurchased 16.7 million shares for approximately $655 million, averaging $39.20 per share. 19 million share repurchases remain unsettled at quarter-end. Looking forward, we are well positioned to meet our $1 billion target for 2011, subject to market conditions. ", "As we approach the end of the year and prepare for the separation of Markets and Education businesses in 2012, we are extremely well capitalized with cash and short-term investments at quarter-end of approximately $1.5 billion. Cash and short-term investments increased close to $150 million from the second quarter. From year-end 2010, cash and short-term investments declined only slightly as share repurchases and acquisitions were largely funded from free cash flow. As I previously indicated, we expect full year cash flow, post dividends, to be approximately $750 million. Gross debt was approximate -- was comprised of approximately $1.2 billion and long-term unsecured senior notes; no commercial paper is outstanding. ", "In closing, The McGraw-Hill Companies is on track for another year of growth in 2011. We expect to achieve full year 2011 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.81 to $2.86. This implies fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.59 versus adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 in the fourth quarter last year. ", "Now, let me turn it back over to Terry.", "Harold McGraw", "Okay. Thanks, Jack, and that completes a review of our operations and our financial position and conditions. Let me quickly make some comments about our Growth and Value Plan. And as you may recall, this is something that we announced last month that it was the combination of a strategic portfolio review that began in midyear 2010, which resulted in a number of the acquisitions that Jack mentioned, especially in Platts, the divestiture of Broadcasting and the creation of McGraw-Hill Financial and it culminated into the Growth and Value Plan. ", "And as you know, the centerpiece of our Growth and Value Plan is the creation of 2 strong public companies, McGraw-Hill Markets and McGraw-Hill Education, and this would be in need of a tax-free spin. Separating global operations obviously is a complex undertaking, which we plan to complete by the end of next year at the latest. We have multiple work streams underway. We're making very good headway. And we are pursuing this plan with a greater sense of urgency so that we complete this work as quickly as possible. We also are making significant headway in our extensive cost reduction program as we disaggregated shared services and established 2 appropriately sized corporate centers, again for the 2 public companies. Based on our initial analysis, we are targeting at least $100 million in cost reductions over the next 15 months. ", "We also entered into an agreement to sell our non-core Broadcasting Group to E.W. Scripps and for $212 million in cash. This move demonstrates our commitment to more sharply define and focus on our portfolio of core businesses. ", "We're also working with Heidrick & Struggles in the search of a new CEO for the Education business, and I'm pleased with the progress that we're making there.", "So with that, let me sum up and say that for The McGraw-Hill Companies, we had a solid third quarter and certainly the first 9 months very solid for 2011. We're making progress to implement our Growth and Value Plan and our results demonstrate the rationale for our decision to separate Markets and Education, 2 great businesses with divergent models. We are delivering significant capital to investors through share repurchases and dividends. We are on track for another year of growth and expect our full year earnings per diluted share from continuing operation will be in the $2.81 to $2.86 range. ", "Okay, let's leave it with that and let's go to the questions. ", "And Don, let's go back to you.", "Donald S. Rubin", "Thank you, Terry. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants [Operator Instructions]. I think we're now ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "This question comes from William Bird from Lazard.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Terry, I was wondering if you could comment on Markets. Given how high differentiated growth has been at Indexes and Platts, are you concerned the value of these businesses could be overlooked in the new Markets business where around 2/3 of the mix will be Ratings?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, no, and that's a little high, but I don't because one of the things that we're going to be doing, Bill, in terms of streamlining the organization is to make it very, very transparent in terms of what those actual numbers and what those growth configurations are, as well as the direction that the new product development initiatives we'll take on in that part. Lou Eccleston was talking and showed one of the slides about all of the cross-asset class collaboration that can go on in terms of developing new product capabilities for new audiences and the like, and we're going to keep that in front of everybody. And then -- and so I think it will be very clear what those businesses are capable of doing and whatever. We're not going to change to a new configuration until we've got the cost structures right in terms of the new entities. So what we're working on now is developing those cost structures so that those operations can be efficient and effective in delivering those. But then we will -- and then we'll streamline the organizational schedule to comply to that. So we'll do everything we can to keep it very transparent so that you can see exactly where we are and where we're going.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And is there any reason why you wouldn't pull 2012 buybacks forward given where the stock is and given the value to be created by new initiatives?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes, we look at that all the time and we're very pleased with the program that we have for this year, and we'll continue to evaluate that and given current conditions, you can expect probably more.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And just a housekeeping question, what was the diluted share base at quarter-end?", "Harold McGraw", "Hold on one sec, Bill. Bill, let me get that number for you. We'll give it to you as soon as we got it right here.", "Operator", "This question comes from Craig Huber from Access 3:42.", "Craig A. Huber - Access 3:42, LLC", "I wanted to first ask about this cost-saving target you guys have been talking about, $100 million plus. Just given that you guys last year had $5 billion of costs across all your different segments and stuff, I mean do you think at the end of the day you could actually get multiples to that $100 million target out of the whole system? And also, if you just elaborate a little bit further about what areas you're looking at to take the most costs out of?", "Harold McGraw", "Okay, Craig, well first of all, as I've mentioned, when you're talking about an aggregate number in excess of $1 billion of corporate assessment -- corporate administration, IT and shared services, the first thing that you have to do is obviously make sure that the cost structures are efficient and effective for the 2 public companies, then we can start talking about how we can reduce that. We believe that at this point, at least $100 million can come out of those -- in those components. And again, it's an ongoing process and we'll just keep you updated as we go. Some people think it could be a lot more, we'll see, but I think at least $100 million at this point and we're going to keep refining and working on that.", "Jack F. Callahan", "And let me provide a little more detail. Because we do have -- to your point that it's a complex cost structure, we have multiple work streams detailing efficiency opportunities across the organization, let me give you a couple of examples. Each business is reviewing its cost base in detail as part of our planning process for next year, and several have already identified no specific interactions. More specifically, we're looking to simplify and streamline the org structure by increasing spans of control and reducing layers. And across corporate and shared services, we have some work to do to separate functions and activities to realign costs to the specific and appropriate cost structure of both Education and Markets. We're reshaping compensation and benefits to meet the industry standards of each industry. And in longer-term, we need to reconsider the footprint of our facilities. So I just give you some examples of the streams of works that are well underway that kind of will fit into the creation of 2 separate companies and a more efficient cost structure.", "Craig A. Huber - Access 3:42, LLC", "And then also, can you speak a little bit if you -- about your -- what's left in Information & Media segment aside from Platts, the Aviation Week, J.D. Power, in your construction of database business? I mean, how wed are you to keeping those businesses in the portfolio here, given that you've sold TV stations, sold Business Week, obviously, 2 years ago?", "Harold McGraw", "All right. Well, certainly in terms of -- we talked about the progress that we're making with J.D. Power and also on the construction side, everybody knows the weakness of the commercial construction business in the marketplace today. And we are combining right now the whole combination of capital markets, commodity platforms, as well as commercial market parts. So at least at this point, we're very wedded to that. And if there's any change, obviously we would let you know. By the way, Jack, on the quarter-end base.", "Jack F. Callahan", "Yes, the quarter-end number was right around 300 -- with 300 million.", "Harold McGraw", "300 million shares on the fully diluted thing.", "Operator", "This question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So, Terry, early in the year, you've highlighted potentially some market share losses at S&P as a reason for a relative revenue weakness. You highlighted specifically, I think, Structured Finance. You think that was a factor in the third quarter in terms of the relatively soft numbers you're seeing?", "Harold McGraw", "A little bit, definitely on that. And hopefully we'll see some pickup but -- in that area, but I don't think materially at this point. Yes, I mean again, when you just talk about the overall, the new issuance numbers in the first half of the year with a lot of the M&A activity and so forth, we're very pleasing in all of this. The contraction obviously is disappointing, but it's very, very reflective obviously of current economic conditions and the lack of some of the corporate activities. Now hopefully with the bank loan market, hopefully with some of the high-yield coming back a little bit, and it will see corporate issuance because of the refinancings and things like that. But we'll -- we're watching it very, very carefully, but that's a key component at this point but it's economic-market driven. We also have to watch the European markets very carefully and we'll see what response comes out of the G20 in another week. But we've got to watch their -- the sovereign debt situation there very carefully as well. So I think we'll see some progress, but we've got to be very cautious here.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Right. And I assume as regards to the fourth quarter, no change in pipeline or issuance like that do you think still continue to be slow?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, we're seeing some pickup. We're watching very carefully again the bank loan market on that part. We're starting to see a little bit more pipeline on the corporate side, and we're looking for the offsets on that as well. And so I'm hopeful that it's going to be a little better situation.", "Jack F. Callahan", "But our outlook is based on a very cautious view. If it's -- if for some reason, confidence comes back in and it springs forward, that would be an upside right now.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "And I'm sorry to focus extensively on this, but the comps are pretty tough here for the next 3 quarters in S&P business. In terms of the cost reduction efforts, is there a focus on the S&P business in particular in the context of what could be a pretty tough revenue environment?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, exactly right. I mean, I think that what we have been doing is taking very and hard looks to maybe what that in the worst-case pipeline situation could be, and Doug Peterson is very much focused on a cost reduction program. And we're see -- you're seeing the effect of that right now. And we'll continue to monitor the pipeline aspect to what more we may have to do.", "Jack F. Callahan", "The thing that will help with S&P is just -- as you know, we've been investing in that business around it in a number of areas over the last 3 to 4 quarters, and the rate of that investment has considerably slowed down in the third quarter, so for example, the QCCR program is now largely flat to year ago. There's been some headcount and comp-related costs that have largely had slowed down Platts. So the slowing of that piece of investment resulted that legal expenses moderated a bit. So there's a number of things that are going to ease some of the expense pressures that we have been seeing for the last few quarters.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just one last thing, Jack, the -- any further thoughts in terms of the timeframe on the spin? Maybe you could just highlight what the constraints are in terms of getting it done sooner rather than later?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, Peter, this is Terry. Obviously, speed is a critical requirement here. I -- what we have said is that we can complete this by the end of 2012, and I think that gives us a fair bit of leeway at this point. And our effort is to do it obviously quicker and I think for all people concerned, that would be a good thing. But let us get through the resizing of the cost structures and get the -- and to get those cost savings, we need to start to implement that sooner rather than later. And so all the effort will go on to that part and we'll just keep you updated on how that proceeds. But yes, and I do think we can put that sooner, but I'll keep with the by the end of 2012 at this point until we've got hard numbers or otherwise.", "Jack F. Callahan", "And I would just add, since the announcement, we now have the opportunity to create a full-blown corporate-wide program management structure to get up the activities that's well underway, and it's part of our weekly rhythm to start working with the various teams to start making decisions and moving forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sloan Bohlen with Goldman Sachs.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is probably a question for Lou just on some of the segments within McGraw-Hill Financial. You broke out some of the revenue for Platts and for the index business. Do you think about operating margin targets for each of the different businesses, Ratings, Capital IQ, Index and Platts?", "Lou Eccleston", "Well, when you look at the businesses inside of McGraw-Hill Financial, you're talking about it and we refer to the big pieces: the Global Credit Portal, which is really; and Capital IQ which is really a part of how we think about a desktop. And then the other big piece is Enterprise, and then you've got Indices. So the way to think about this model is we're driving not so much individual P&L's of a business as Capital IQ or a business as the Global Credit Portal, but if you go back to that model we put up, Sloan, you see there's a lot of the efficiencies and shared costs that actually create the ability for a desktop business to build faster, to create solutions faster. As you integrate all of these data sets for Enterprise, you can go out with an offering that gives you all the asset classes integrated into a single solution. And then you've got single contracts. It just creates a lot of efficiency. So really, the focus is more around how does McGraw-Hill Financial at the top line grow? How do we grow overall profitability? And then as Terry said, we're going to be very transparent in terms of how are the Index business is going, how is Platts doing, so where you've really got clear individual businesses, we'll be very transparent on that. But overall, what you're really going to be focused on is around desktop and Enterprise, and how it drives both the efficiencies and the foundation of the model, and then driving those product segments more so than seeing them as individual businesses.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so in terms of, say, all else being equal on the top line, is there an amount you expect in terms of margin enhancement by kind of realizing those synergies?", "Lou Eccleston", "Well, I think you've already seen the results this year of that. Just by simply, Sloan, not doing things multiple times, you pick up margin enhancement. The beauty of the model, which is whether it's McGraw-Hill Financial that we've been at for the last 8 or 9 months or where we're going to go with Markets is that, that model does 2 things automatically. First and foremost it creates efficiencies, it creates the opportunities for margin expansion, but it also gives you the ability to drive revenue growth faster because you can get products out the door faster. So by definition, it creates those opportunities. And I think where you see our margin goes will be a function of where do we go organically and then are there inorganic opportunities well in the future. So I think our overall goal, though, is maximum growth and the margin will be a reflection of how much of this is organic versus -- inorganic versus organic. And that -- but the goal there is the fastest growth and the broadest footprint globally.", "Harold McGraw", "Yes. And, Sloan, this is Terry. Obviously, as we're finishing up on 2011 and so forth, we're already living in 2012 and that plan, it's a little early to come out with the projections on that part but the whole game plan is revenue growth and margin expansion in the Markets area. And so as we get the cost structures implemented as the -- and as we get the organizational implementation done, you fully can expect margin expansion.", "Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just maybe one question on whether or not there's an update on the potential joint venture with the Dow Jones Indexes from CMU?", "Harold McGraw", "Well, I can't really comment on that one at this point, Sloan. I saw the press reports that came out with some of those kind of things. We didn't come out with that. And so right now, the S&P Index business is doing fabulous and we're very excited about it. And Lou talked about it, almost 360 exchange-traded funds now based on S&P Indices and it's growing at a terrific rate. We're very excited about this business and stay tuned.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Arthur from Evercore.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Yes. Terry, on the Texas change in terms of giving the districts flexibility on how they spend the money that's allotted, do you think that, that is short-term in nature and that they will -- these districts will eventually have to buy books? Or do you think that's more of a permanent change in terms of their -- how they get state money to allocate however they want?", "Harold McGraw", "Yes. And it's a great question, Doug, and it's a nebulous answer because everything in K-12 right now is short term and Texas is no exclusion to that. They've come up with this allotment system, trying to bring some equity between different districts within Texas. They could very easily change it again. It's just that the funding pressures at the state level are so enormous. And right now, my sense of it is that there's a process of taking a little from here, a little from here, and so forth then trying to think through that you've got a coordinated approach, and it's not. One of the things that states are going to have to do is prioritize better and then fully fund those disciplines that they're going to prioritize. So everything right now on the K-12 funding side, again is short term.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Meltz, JPMorgan.", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I have 2 questions for you. Understanding the adjustment to EPS guidance, can you update us on where your expectations are for segment revenues for the 4 segments, please? And then I have a follow-up.", "Harold McGraw", "Is that for the fourth quarter, Michael?", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No, I'm saying full year. Full year S&P, you had been pointing to 7% to 9% revenue growth.", "Jack F. Callahan", "Well, I mean, let's -- going back to initial guidance, I mean obviously, the year is -- it's had its upsides and its down. I think on relative to our ingoing and expectations in guidance on the year from a revenue point of view, McGraw-Hill Financial is pretty much right on in the top line, doing better on the bottom line based on some of the margin expansion that Lou spoke with. Information & Media has had a better year than we anticipated with stronger top line, and so it's been a good year for Information & Media. I think the 2 places where obviously in this building of the themes of the call where relative to our incoming assumptions we've been struggling with is Education where we thought we'd get some growth there, but I think we're looking at a mid to high single-digit decline in Education given what's happened in the all-important third quarter here. And Standard & Poor's is -- had some good quarters kind of given the activity we saw in the first half for the year, but that clearly has slowed. So we're probably sort of in the mid-single range for the full year, which is a bit down from that high single view we thought we had coming into the year and the more robust capital markets outlook that we had in the first half.", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So does that imply S&P flattish in Q4 or down?", "Harold McGraw", "Well and again, from our standpoint, we are -- the word that we're using is cautious in terms of the near-term outlook. But as I was saying with Bill Bird's question, we're hopeful here. We see some pipeline in all of that. And I think it's a little early to just see how much of that is going to translate. But we're optimistic that there could be some good activity in the fourth quarter. So at this point, I think that in terms of the overall guidance of $2.81, $2.86, we've got a range there that takes into account a flat fourth quarter to a much more positive one, especially for S&P.", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then related to that, your guidance, your shifting out the TV business and -- or it sounds like you are, and -- but your year -- I think the year-ago -- maybe the answer is what was the EBIT or EPS benefit for TV last year?", "Jack F. Callahan", "Michael, first of all, we'll have detailed reconciliations on the Web right after this call to help you all through that because we did take Broadcasting in discontinued operations. Last year from an EPS point of view, it did provide about $0.01 a year ago. So that's why our -- and opposed to stock's view of Broadcasting, last year went from $2.69 to $2.68.", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And so that's my -- leads up to my final question. So the -- when you have tax in here, you're giving great disclosure on Indexes and now Platts, that the Platts revenues where you are saying it's now half the revenues in the quarter?", "Jack F. Callahan", "That's approaching half. It's approaching half.", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Is that a run rate? Was that -- and is that all -- essentially all subscription or is there -- was there something that really helped it in the quarter and it's not a full year basis, it's not that high?", "Jack F. Callahan", "Well, I mean it's obviously been aided because you have -- it's organic growth is quite strong, but it's been benefited by 2 acquisitions. That's still positive versus a year ago. BENTEK closed in the first very early days of January and Steel Business Briefing in July, so I wouldn't -- 25% does have those 2 acquisitions that are helping it.", "Harold McGraw", "I mean, that wouldn't necessarily be a run rate.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Edward Atorino with Benchmark.", "Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Terry, the non-transaction revenues really took a jump. Could you sort of explain what went on there? Is that going to continue at the nice high rate? And secondly, you mentioned I think in -- about a little pick up in bonds. Are you seeing anything happening in Europe? I presume the increase was in the U.S.", "Harold McGraw", "Ed, you're exactly right, and we expect -- and again, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves in projecting what people are going to do, but we are seeing some activity on the corporate side and we'd like to see that continue. We also are looking very much at the bank loan market. Europe is very much a wildcard and we're watching that very carefully. I mean, the obvious demand and need is extremely high. How it gets translated is the issue. I would -- I think that you are going to see a pickup in bond issuance in Europe, but we haven't seen it today. On the non-transaction side, that was the game plan for quite a while now to be able to smooth out volatility associated with the transaction side. And so that is the much bigger piece now in terms of the fees and the subscriptions and in terms of surveillance and all of those kind of things. It gives us a very, very strong steady base. And you put with that the pickup on the transaction side, as well as the focus on bank loans and the refinancings, I think the picture looks a little brighter.", "Jack F. Callahan", "We also, too, have been benefiting there on the non-transaction side from international growth, both about to some degree in Europe but also from CRISIL. So there is the -- that we grow outside U.S., that's also helping that metric.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call.

Merritt", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning at The McGraw-Hill Companies First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. I'm Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations at The McGraw-Hill Companies. ", "This morning, we issued a news release with our results. We hope you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com. Once again, www.mcgraw-hill.com.

The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. ", "The results for the prior year quarter also reflect the reclassification of the Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation.

However, this call is intended for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Patti Rockenwagner in our New York office at (212) 512-3533 subsequent to this call. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. Terry?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay, thank you, Chip, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's conference call. You just heard, once again, from Chip Merritt. He's our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Chip joined us about a month ago, and we certainly are glad to have him aboard. ", "For the last 73 quarters, Don Rubin introduced our earnings conference calls. On February 20, 2012, our Senior Vice President for Investor Relations, Don Rubin, passed away after only recently announcing his retirement from McGraw-Hill. His distinguished career was 52 years long. He was a manager, a thought leader, a mentor and a beloved friend to all, and his legacy has been one of growth, purpose, passion, trust and relevance. I had the distinct honor of working closely with Don for many, many of those years. With Don's passing, McGraw-Hill has lost a leader, and personally, we have lost a very close and dear friend. And I know this is true for many of you on the earnings call today. ", "Don began his career as a sports writer and was a journalist at heart. And to honor Don's rich legacy at McGraw-Hill, the corporation has established a scholarship at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, and I can think of no better way to say goodbye to our dear friend than to say hello to future Rubin scholars in the lifetime ahead. ", "All right, joining me on today's conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review first quarter results, provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress and give the outlook for the balance of the year. ", "There are a couple of themes that permeate today's discussion and are at the core of our focus here at the company. Obviously, number one is delivering top and bottom line growth; and the other is executing upon our Growth and Value Plan. ", "These are at the forefront of our strategy to transform McGraw-Hill into 2 powerful new companies, and we're pleased with the progress made thus far in 2012. We see incredible opportunity ahead as we create McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education. Both companies share a common promise and a common purpose. We're about helping our customers find new ways to succeed and to prosper in a rapidly changing world where information is often conflicting, confounding and sometimes confusing. The bottom line is that we help make sense of it all. ", "To be clear, our mission is never, nor never will be, about us. It will always be about our customers, and if we remain focused on them, solid business results will follow. Therefore, we are very pleased to begin the year with a record first quarter. $1.3 billion is a record for the first quarter revenue and $0.51 is a record for first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share. ", "What makes these results all the more impressive is that they occurred during the quarter in which so many of our employees were focused on the work streams necessary for the separation of the company. ", "As you will see momentarily, the 3 segments that will comprise McGraw-Hill Financial delivered strong top line growth. This performance, coupled with success of cost reduction efforts associated with our restructuring and the recent substantial share repurchases, led to record first quarter profitability. What is also notable is that on a pro forma basis, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education both delivered increased year-over-year adjusted operating profits. ", "Steady progress has been made on the Growth and Value Plan during the first quarter. We remain on track for separation into the 2 industry-leading companies by year end. We have filed a request with the Internal Revenue Service for a ruling that the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education is tax-free to the corporation and its shareholders. And I'm very pleased to inform you that as of late last night, we have received a favorable ruling from the IRS agreeing to the tax-free status for the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education. ", "The corporation also plans to file the Form 10 in the coming weeks. We remain on track to deliver in excess of $100 million on a run rate basis and cost savings by year end. These cost savings are also seen across the corporation with first quarter expense growth on an adjusted basis of only 3%, which expanded the consolidated margin by approximately 200 basis points. ", "Implementation is well underway on the Growth and Value Plan. Globally, there are more than 100 people supporting more than 15 work streams to drive separation and to reduce costs, and we will continue to invest in McGraw-Hill Financial through targeted acquisitions. ", "So far this year, we have acquired 2 companies, both adding capability to S&P Capital IQ's platform. The first was R2 Financial Technologies. With this addition, S&P Capital IQ will now be able to offer clients an integrated view of market and credit risk across asset classes in a unique solution. This is increasingly important for financial institutions that are looking to manage complex and diverse portfolios across the globe. By combining R2, clarify and risk solutions development teams, we have the foundation to build a powerful and innovative new offering for professional investors. ", "The second acquisition was QuantHouse. QuantHouse provides S&P Capital IQ clients with a global integrated low-latency distribution network. They will develop a new generation of desktop monitoring and display applications, alpha generation tools and integrated low-latency data feeds, moving S&P Capital IQ closer to becoming a one-stop shop for all financial industry professionals. ", "With that, let me now turn to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial, on a pro forma basis, delivered a very solid quarter with revenue up 8% and operating profit up 10%. While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was clearly Commodities & Commercial that led the operating profit growth. McGraw-Hill Financial derives 40% of its revenues from outside the United States. And during this first quarter, the international business growth of 12% outpaced domestic growth of 5%. ", "The Standard & Poor's Ratings segment led the way as the most influential on the international side, with 47% of its first quarter revenue from sales outside of the United States. S&P Ratings is the largest business segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. Revenue for this segment grew 5%, driven predominantly by transaction revenue, which increased 10%. ", "The key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were: one, the U.S. public finance issuance, which increased 61%. But recall now that the muni market was adversely impacted back in the first quarter of 2011 by weak municipal economies and the perceived risk of a wave of muni defaults, which did not come to fruition. Secondly is the U.S. corporate issuance increased 8%, driven by record speculative-grade issuance, which increased 14%. During the quarter, risk aversion waned due to the European Central Bank liquidity. But in the global capital markets and a temporary resolution of the European sovereign situation, this resulted in a quest for yield by investors and European nonfinancial corporate issuance, which increased 31%. ", "Non-transaction revenue, which represents 58% of first quarter revenue, increased by 2%. ", "The macro themes that we have shared with you in the past relating to the ratings market remain in place, namely: a large pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced. Another would be the shift in Europe from bank loans to the public debt markets. In fact, during the first quarter, European companies borrowed more from the bond market than they did from banks. This trend was highlighted in a Wall Street Journal article written earlier this month entitled, Bonds With Banks Fraying. European Companies' Move Into Debt Markets Bucks Direct-Lending Tradition.", "And finally, the structured finance market recovery remains beholden to improved activity in the residential and commercial real estate markets. ", "Operating profit was down slightly in the quarter as we made targeted investments in new employees to reinforce growth of corporate and government ratings, as well as growth in emerging markets. In addition, legal expenses were up versus a year ago, but were more modestly down on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011. ", "While certainly expensive, our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. Three additional cases were dismissed in the first quarter, bringing the total to date to 27. Seven dismissals by the lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. ", "One very important case was the Reese case. Earlier this month, the judge granted our motion to dismiss all claims against the corporation. This was important because it was 1 of 4 purported class actions stock drop cases filed against the corporation associated with the financial crisis, and now all 4 have been dismissed. ", "The Ratings business remains an area of focus for regulators. While I recognize that the suggested regulations in Europe continue to evolve, I'm increasingly encouraged by some of the more pragmatic views that have been expressed more recently. All in all, I'm encouraged by Ratings' start to the year. I believe that we are investing appropriately in the business to enable continued growth. And as the credit markets continue to normalize, we are well positioned for success. ", "Let me now turn to S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices, the second-largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. It delivered top -- solid top and bottom line results with revenue and operating profit increasing 9% and 11%, respectively. Both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices delivered year-over-year revenue growth with 75% of revenue coming from subscriptions, up from 74% a year ago. ", "Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 10% and a key driver of this growth was the 11% increase in Capital IQ clients year-over-year. However, both RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect also contributed to the double-digit revenue growth. This was in part due to the cross-selling opportunities that are being realized as both the Global Credit Portal and TheMarkets.com are migrating onto the Capital IQ platform. ", "Another driver of subscriber growth is the continuous enhancements to the platform. A few examples include the iPhone and BlackBerry apps that are now available and an enterprise solutions software development kit that was launched in January that will allow our clients, IT personnel to pull just the data they need when they need it. ", "With the acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse, along with internal capabilities, S&P Capital IQ is well poised now to deliver further competitive capabilities to offer our clients the most comprehensive market data and risk analytics platform in the industry. ", "S&P Indices revenue increased 5%. The key contributor to this was an 11% increase in assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices. During the quarter, 10 brand new indices and 23 variants to existing indices were launched. Also, during the quarter, 41 new exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices were launched, bringing the total to 419 ETFs. These new additions bode well for the continued growth of S&P Indices. ", "Another area of excitement within S&P Indices is the pending joint venture with the CME Group. We continue to anticipate completing this transaction by midyear.", "Clearly, the highlight of the quarter was the performance of the Commodities & Commercial segment. While the smallest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial, it delivered year-over-year operating profit gains that led all the other segments. Revenue growth was 13% with international revenue up 23%. Not only was there strong top line growth, but the expense control was outstanding, resulting in impressive segment operating profit margin expanding to over 27%. ", "Within Commodities, subscriptions for petroleum and national -- natural gas products drove the 22% increase in revenue. Since the acquisition of BENTEK Energy, we have been leveraging our Platts sales force to drive increases in our natural gas business. ", "Because of the growth in our Commodities business, I thought it would be instructive to spend a few minutes discussing our hidden gem, Platts. Platts is a leading provider of oil, natural gas, electric power, coal, shipping, petrochemicals and metals information. Importantly, more than 90% of revenue is derived from subscriptions. That results in a business with very little volatility. ", "Market Data is Platts' largest product. It is a subscription service that provides access to the latest price data, including end-of-day assessments, third-party data and access to a complete historical database. Platts' price data is highly valuable to traders, risk managers, analysts and others who seek unbiased price assessments. Because of the importance that the market participants place on Platts' price assessments, they are frequently utilized as reference points in long-term contracts between 2 parties. As such, Platts has become integral to the functioning of the industries in which it serves. We believe that Platts can continue to deliver meaningful growth by focusing on extending capabilities within markets it already serves and expanding into new market areas. ", "With Commercial, J.D. Power delivered significant year-over-year revenue growth. While all industry sectors delivered growth, automotive led the way both domestically and internationally. ", "With that, let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education reported a 2% decline in revenue, yet delivered a 13% increase in segment operating profit. By now, everyone is very familiar with the weakness in the el-hi market. In contrast, both Higher Education and Professional delivered nice revenue growth. Also, quite encouraging were the cost reductions that the segment delivered, most notably as a result of the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2011. We want to ensure that our cost structure is optimal for the new market realities and that we make the appropriate investments in the digital products that our customers demand. ", "Because the first quarter is such a seasonally light quarter, I'm not going to get into detailed discussions regarding adoption in open territory progress, but we'll be doing that as we go forward. Instead, I'd like to focus on digital progress. As I've said before, I believe that the digitization of education represents the opportunity of the century. As McGraw-Hill Education is formally launched later this year as an independent company, it will be one of the market's commanding leaders with a brand name that's already universally recognized and respected for past accomplishments. We are targeting new achievements in a changing educational landscape that's limited only by our imagination. ", "Currently, Professional and Higher Education are leading our efforts in delivering digital solutions to address customer needs in the marketplace. Nearly 40% of Professional revenue came from digital products during the quarter. This shift is also happening in our larger Higher Education arena, which realized a roughly 50% increase in digital revenue year-over-year. ", "Since digital products are often subscription-based, another way to measure the traction that these products are making to our product portfolio is to take a look at deferred revenue. Deferred revenue grew 63% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2011 to $106 million. This gain was largely driven by the sales of CINCH Science, an all-digital curriculum for the school market; and McGraw-Hill Connect, a homework management and study system for the higher education market. ", "The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 2% increase in revenue. We were excited to see a continuation of the recent strength in Higher Education and Professional with revenues up from the prior year by mid-single digits. These increases were partially offset by a decline in international results. ", "The School Education Group reported a 10% decline in revenue from the prior year, with decrease occurring in both the instructional materials and testing businesses. The first quarter is the smallest in the el-hi market, representing approximately 11% of annual sales, and results are not predictive of full year trends. Those trends are being determined now as school districts across the country decide which materials they will order later in the year for use beginning next fall. So far, the spring selling season appears to be progressing well for McGraw-Hill and the industry in terms of district level activity. However, funding concerns remain acute in many areas. We will have a better view on the full year el-hi market at the end of the second quarter. ", "We are setting up the Education business to thrive as a stand-alone company. We are putting in place the cost structure and digital capabilities necessary for McGraw-Hill Education to lead the transformation of the industry. ", "And therefore, in summary, McGraw-Hill Companies is off to a record start to the year. McGraw-Hill Financial should continue to deliver solid growth. With bolt-on acquisitions and our in-house capabilities, we plan to continue to deliver increased capabilities to our customers. McGraw-Hill Education will focus on capitalizing on the opportunity of the century by driving unique, new digital product offerings to satisfy a changing educational landscape while simultaneously creating a cost structure that is rightsized to serve the market. The corporation will remain focused on delivering on our Growth and Value Plan and continue to work towards the completion of the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education by year end. ", "Okay. That completes our review of operations. I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some key financials. Jack?", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Terry. Let me begin this morning by discussing our consolidated results. Terry has just discussed the record first quarter revenue that we delivered, which represented 6% growth versus 2011. The solid revenue performance was leveraged by limiting our adjusted expense growth to just 3%, essentially 1/2 of our revenue growth. As a result, we were able to realize adjusted operating profit growth of 18% and delivered a consolidated adjusted operating margin of 19%. This resulted in margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points versus last year. ", "We are beginning to see the benefits from the multiple initiatives underway across the organization to improve expense productivity as we separate the company and prepare for the spin-off of Education. ", "In addition, we were able to leverage this strong growth with substantial share repurchases. The result was to turn the 18% growth in adjusted operating profit into a 30% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our share repurchase program is an important part of the Growth and Value Plan. Since the beginning of 2011, the corporation has repurchased nearly 36 million shares at a weighted average price of $42.05. This is a reduction of approximately 12% of the shares outstanding at that time. ", "Apart from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program, no other shares were repurchased so far in 2012. As we get closer to separation and accumulate additional cash, we will consider when to resume share repurchases. ", "We have a very strong balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of $932 million. Year-over-year, our adjusted free cash flow was down $44 million. The first quarter is the seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. This was exaggerated this year by the timing of some working capital and tax payment items. We fully expect to deliver another year of solid adjusted free cash flow growth, with guidance of approximately $750 million. ", "Now let me provide some additional details around the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. The margin expansion that we delivered in the first quarter was, in part, due to these efforts. We have already taken some actions that deliver cost saving, and as the year progresses, we plan to take more. Therefore, the cost savings from these initiatives should step up throughout the year. However, we are not solely focused on reducing costs. We continue to make targeted investments in the business to support global growth and enhanced capability. ", "We do want to give you our current outlook with regard to the onetime costs in support of the separation and the cost reduction plan. Please keep in mind that these are estimates and timing has not been finalized. We will update you as we progress through the year. ", "During the first quarter, we incurred $33 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan costs that we noted in this morning's press release. We anticipate that for the remainder of the year, we will incur an additional $100 million of onetime separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. These onetime expenses are largely professional fees as we need to support the various consultants, business process and information technology firms and financial advisors. Please keep in mind this is the working estimate. ", "In addition, we anticipate that during 2012, we will continue to incur restructuring costs as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives as we did during the fourth quarter of 2011. While the timing of these actions are still fluid, restructuring expense for 2012 could be approximately up to $75 million. ", "As we prepare to file the Form 10 necessary for a tax-free spin of the Education business, I want to update you with some high-level thoughts with regards to the capital structure of the 2 new companies. We expect that McGraw-Hill Financial will carry a strong investment-grade rating and continue to be committed to a strong dividend. ", "With McGraw-Hill Education, we are targeting a more flexible investment-grade rating and a modest dividend. We will ensure that at the time of the spin-off, that there is adequate liquidity to meet business needs and to manage the seasonal fluctuations in working capital. And as Terry mentioned, we have received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service agreeing to the tax-free status for the spin-off of McGraw-Hill Education. ", "All in all, we are off to a terrific start with a record first quarter. Our guidance remains unchanged, separation activities are accelerating, our cost reduction programs are on track and we are focused on the mission to establish 2 powerful industry leaders by year end. ", "With that, now let me turn the call back over to Terry McGraw.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay, thanks, Jack. And Chip, do you have any start-off questions?", "Robert S. Merritt", "Sure. So just some instructions here. [Operator Instructions] And now we're ready to take your first question. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] This question comes from William Bird with Lazard.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Just based on your pipeline of new issuance right now, do you think transaction-based issuance can grow in Q2 just given the big refi boom last May?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "The answer to that is yes from what we're seeing at this point, both in terms of corporate's and government's continued activity on the public finance side and also some growth in the covered bonds. So yes, I think so.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And just as a follow-on, what do you expect prospectively for S&P expenses?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, again, for Q1, coming out of the fourth quarter, we had a couple of targeted expenses that were unusual to the quarter and it had a bit of an effect on it. We see that's moving out and being on a more normal run rate for the rest of the year, but we will see. We also had some onetime additional legal costs that were associated with that. And we see that's moving out as well. So we think that there was just a couple of targeted expense areas influencing us and that we'll be back to a more normal run rate.", "John F. Callahan", "I'll just add, it was -- we were right around 40% margins in Q1. And I think on a full year basis, we would look to be sort of in that range or a tad better.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Great. Just one final question. On Commodities & Commercial, you had really tight expense management with very high revenues. I'm just wondering what you're expecting for the expense profile of that business going forward.", "John F. Callahan", "The margin's is a spectacular start for that business, in the high 20s. I think we'd kind of on a full year basis, be pointing back, and from a margin point of view, more just sort of toward the mid-20s. As we sort through the year, there's going to be some timing of some investments as we go through the year, and the mix was quite good in Q1. So we're not -- we wouldn't project to maintain that margin for the full year at this time.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, but we are very pleased with it and...", "John F. Callahan", "Spectacular start.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "And getting to the mid-20s is a good position for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber, Huber Research Partners.", "Craig Huber", "I\u2019m just curious on the share buyback, why did you stop, I guess, in the first quarter, the share buyback? It's on hold, it sounds like, until you're closer to the spin. That's my first question.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. Well, look, we went through an accelerated program through 2011, completing 1.5 million shares -- $1.5 billion in terms of a buyback. And so coming into this year and seeing how the Growth and Value Plan was progressing, we just slowed that part down and we are dedicated to it, and we will get back to it.", "John F. Callahan", "And just seasonally, I wouldn't use the word limited, but it is the low point in terms of domestic cash availability and we'll start to accumulate as we go through the year. And as we get closer to separation, we'll be back to evaluate that.", "Craig Huber", "And then also, concerning the spin, is there any chance that you actually end up selling the Education division as opposed to spinning it off, or is that off the table at this stage?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, it's very important, Craig, that we have a very clear and established direction and the direction that we have taken is that of a spin. We were looking for the IRS' favorable ruling, which we've received. The Form 10 is ready to go. And in terms of standing up the business, a lot of progress is made. Now having said that, and consistently I've said that we will look at all aspects of this, the most important thing is obviously getting the most value we possibly can for the shareholders. And that's what we'll do. But our direction and -- to make sure that we're on progress and that the outcome is for 2012, we are on to the spin, but we will obviously look at all things.", "Craig A. Huber - Access 3:42, LLC", "And my other question here, please, Terry, it looks like each of the last 2 years your total costs are between $4.7 billion, $4.8 billion. You've talked about taking on a run rate in excess of $100 million. I mean, the fact that you're even in a ballpark of $100 million, is that really a light, conservative number in your mind, Terry, as you think out here? I mean are you feeling increasingly confident you could significantly exceed $100 million of cost savings, please?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, Craig, as I've said before, it's important to put a benchmark down and we have said in excess of $100 million. Clearly, as we complete both the preparation and the execution for separation, there are going to be a lot of other opportunities to look at and some are clear and some are not yet. And so I think sticking with at least $100 million is the right thing to do, and we will keep informing you of changes to that. And I agree with you, I think that there is an upside to that number.", "John F. Callahan", "And Bill, just to -- I think there's not too many companies out there that are working on both separation and cost reduction at the same time. And I fully anticipate each company, once they are separate as we go into 2013, will be detailing their own productivity plans going forward.", "Craig A. Huber - Access 3:42, LLC", "Lastly, if I could, Terry. I mean in the past, you'd given a preliminary outlook for your thoughts on the adoption market for the new year in open territories. What's your current thoughts? I know it's early in the year, but just what do you expect the overall market to be? Down, I assume, for adoption market in the open territory?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, I think that it's going to be a difficult market for 2012 and this is coming off of several years of a difficult market. When you have as many states as we do that are in deficit and the funding comes from state and local municipality tax structures, it's putting an awful lot of pressure on the K-12 system and all that. And certainly, one of the things that, from a political agenda and hopefully from a business and government agenda, America has to start to think about infrastructure, education and 21st century skill sets and our investment in those areas if we're going to be successful in this knowledge economy. But clearly, the funding level is down significantly on the adoption side and the open territory side at best is going to be fragmented.", "Craig A. Huber - Access 3:42, LLC", "Can you maybe quantify those 2 thoughts, though, between the 2 markets? I mean you're thinking down 5% to 10% or it\u2019ll be [indiscernible] worse than that?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "From where we are right now?", "Craig A. Huber - Access 3:42, LLC", "Yes, but versus what happened last year.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes -- no, I think we're going to be down, and I would say your 5% to 10% range is probably right.", "Operator", "This question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So, Jack, can you give us any specifics in terms of what you think the -- this is a follow-on to Mr. Bird's question earlier, what the run rate on S&P cost growth should look like for the balance of the year?", "John F. Callahan", "Peter, we were -- in terms of -- all-in for the balance, I think sort of mid- to high-single digit in some of the expense growth rate. I think that we have some overlaps that may move around a little bit. But again, we're going to prudently manage any headcount adds depending on what's going on in the overall marketplace. I mean, right now, one of the challenges we're dealing with is, at least in certain segments, we have pretty fast growth right now and we have to be sure that we have the right capability to stay on. And I think all-in for the year, we'll be 40% or a bit better from a margin point of view and that's sort of the range we're seeing as we stand right now.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I guess the real question, Jack, is in the context of what's been pretty healthy issuance volume here, I guess I'm slightly surprised maybe I don't see more operating leverage in the business. So is 40% the new normal then in terms of where margins should be? Or do you think there's room for that number to move higher?", "John F. Callahan", "I think there\u2019s opportunity to move higher, I'm not sure I'd point to a big step up this year.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Not this year, I was thinking more in the context of secular growth in issuance over the next couple of years.", "John F. Callahan", "I certainly believe there's an opportunity to start to leverage that and start to move forward. There are -- and it's not just the mix within S&P. I do think some of our broader cost initiatives, particularly once we get to a more focused operating company, McGraw-Hill Financial will provide the operation a few more opportunities to continue to get an improved expense productivity moving forward.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And then I'm wondering, so you've had considerable success on the legal side, obviously, with these 37, I guess, those cases dismissed or withdrawn. So when do we see the legal costs -- I'm sorry?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "27.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "27 and then 10 more withdrawn, right?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Right.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So when do we see the legal costs actually start declining? And Terry, are you reasonably comfortable now that the -- I know you can never dismiss completely the legal risk, but maybe just your assessment of the legal risk given the success you've had so far?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, thanks, Peter. We've said all along with the types of suits that these represent, Standard & Poor's is clearly not a seller or distributor of securities. And so anything that would say or suggest that we do is just flat out wrong. And once we get our opportunity to explain that, that gets recognized. In terms of stock drop suits and things like that, again it just takes time to get through the system and we do everything at the federal level. And it takes about 2.5 years from when you get a suit before you get before a federal judge. So the time part is there. So I think the overall picture and the success that we said is in keeping with exactly what I said back about 1.5 years, a couple of years ago, which is that the risk is relatively low and it's bearing out. And you're right. Who knows and what comes around. And we will deal with everything as we go. But right now, the legal risk is low and we're very pleased with the reaction that we're getting in the system.", "John F. Callahan", "And Peter, one thing I'd just add that just from the way the expense -- the overlaps went, we had a tough overlap in Q1. But I would note that legal expense on sequential basis was down a bit. So nothing's changed in Q1 that we didn't have with us in Q4.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And would those legal costs continue to move lower, do you think, sequentially, Jack?", "John F. Callahan", "I wouldn't -- look, I think with the cases that are left, there's some run rate spend until, I think, some of these cases are resolved. So I wouldn't point to any immediate upside there, but...", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And then one last thing. Now that you have the IRS approval, what needs to happen to get the deal done? Can you give us a little sort of the timetable benchmarks that we should be looking for?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, in terms of the spin, we are looking -- we said by the end of 2012 and we're looking a little quicker than that. Obviously, we've got to file the Form 10. We've got to work on standing up the business as an independent company, which means strengthening elements of the management team. And so as we do that from a timetable standpoint, we're looking at somewhere hopefully in the October and November standpoint.", "Operator", "This question comes from Michael Meltz from JPMC.", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question is on guidance. Can you just perhaps just update us, you're -- you are reiterating the EPS guidance. Are you still sticking with what you said in February or the end of January on the segments or companies, McGraw-Hill Financial, I believe you said revenues and profits up 7% to 9% or up high singles and Education revenues and profits relatively flat? That's the first question.", "John F. Callahan", "Yes -- no, I think we'd like or I think we\u2019d be in pretty much in the same place today. I think we've done a few -- within McGraw-Hill Financial, some of the segments, McGraw-Hill -- S&P Capital IQ Index, it will be -- some of the acquisitions we're doing could be a tad dilutive to their run rate for the balance of the year. We're going to have -- we're having a lot of volatility on the Index side, so that can move around a little bit. But we're also, on the other hand, perhaps a bit more optimistic about the growth in Ratings than maybe we were back in January. So I think on balance, overall, the way I'd characterize McGraw-Hill Financial, we're still feeling pretty comfortable with the outlook for the year.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "And also, for the guidance, Michael, for the entire company, with the $3.25, $3.35 EPS, we're right on that.", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Jack, I appreciate the commentary on the leverage profile of the 2 companies. I don't know what the S&P vernacular is, but can you -- what does strong investment grade and flexible investment grade, what does that mean in terms of actual leverage numbers? Debt-to-EBITDA, how should we think about that?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, I mean, in terms of McGraw-Hill Financial -- in terms of McGraw-Hill Education because that's really where they were seeing obviously a change in terms of a rating, probably BBB- would be a potential way to think about it. And then effectively no change for McGraw-Hill Financial relative to maybe better over time.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, maybe better.", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, and then just the last question for me. The comment on the timing or just the separation charges is -- so the aggregate cost of this program, as you see it, is you said $133 million or so this year, I think, and then what was it last year?", "John F. Callahan", "Last year, it was $10 million. We called that out specifically in Q4. And so that's when we started to incur -- let me give you a sense of what's in those numbers. Part of it is there's just work that has to be done here so -- just to get the Form 10 ready, we had gotten some help from -- in the IRS. We've gotten some help from some of the accounting consulting firms. We have some process consultants in helping us manage the various work streams that we have going across the company. For a while, we're going to outsource certain activities, most likely going to outsource certain activities that we're going to have -- we're going to have to start paying those vendors before we start to realize the cost saves. So effectively, for a couple of months, we're going to have double costs. It's just trying to give you some sense of that onetime cost of driving the separations. So those are just some examples of what's in there.", "Michael A. Meltz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, and then my final question related to that. You had -- I think on the last call, you said you'd likely get the Form 10 out in the first part of April and now you're saying the coming weeks. And I think, Terry, you just said spin timing October and November. Has there been any delay in your process? I just want to make sure we fully understand the timing of everything here.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "No, no. We just want to make sure that in terms of making sure that we have the most complete information in the Form 10, we're looking at a number of issues in terms of both management organization and some of the shared costs, and so we're essentially ready to go and I think you'll see something very soon.", "Operator", "This question comes from Doug Arthur from Evercore.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just going back to the Ratings business, when you read the press release on kind of the drivers of the business in Q1, U.S. looks very strong, Europe had some issues particularly in the financials. Yet when you get to the bottom of the paragraph, it says international grew faster than domestic. So I'm trying to understand, is that a mix issue? Did it relate to non-transaction revenues? I mean can you sort of break that down a little bit more fully?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, what we were saying that McGraw-Hill Financial now, that's all 3 segments, derives about 40% of its revenues from outside the United States and that was growing at 12% versus domestic growth of about 5%. And clearly, the contribution was coming not only from S&P Ratings, but also S&P Capital IQ, Indices and Platts on that side as well.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, yes, I was just referring specifically to the Ratings business. But I mean, it just looks like your mix was much more favorable U.S. versus international, but international revenues outpaced U.S. So I was just trying to understand that.", "John F. Callahan", "One comment on the U.S. is that while obviously the bond market was very active in Q1, the bank loan market was actually down considerably versus year ago. So there was a bit of a mix impact in the U.S. But again, the bond market in the U.S. was fantastic. And also, too, the international side, I think continues to benefit a little bit more on the non-transaction side with the continued growth in the broad product lines that we have within our CRISIL business and some of our other international businesses.", "Operator", "This question comes from David Reynolds from Piper Jaffray.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "It's Jefferies actually. Just want to ask about the Ratings business. I noted you mentioned some growth in costs in the emerging markets side of that business and I just wonder if you could talk to the emerging markets opportunity where you see it impacting your business across the piece and perhaps if you've got a feel for the relative growth prospects coming from emerging markets.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, David, it's a great question because that's exactly what we're seeing, is tremendous emerging market activity. As we see more local bond markets cropping up, whether it be Tel Aviv or Johannesburg or Jakarta or any of these places, they are all trying to develop the capability of being able to establish more robust capital markets. And increasingly, for us, besides the more developed countries, a lot of activity is going to develop partnerships and developing stronger relationships in those markets. A great example of that is in India, is the whole CRISIL operation, which is doing exceptionally well and growing at a fabulous rate. But also because of the fact that with infrastructure financing and so forth, in India alone, over the next 5 years, they're going to need $1 trillion of infrastructure financing. So that's where some of that kind of growth is coming from. So again, especially driven off of infrastructure, the emerging markets represent an increasingly very important opportunity for us.", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from Edward Atorino from Benchmark.", "Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "You gave digital as a percent of Professional. What's Professional as a percent of Education?", "John F. Callahan", "Ed, it's Jack. Professional's actually -- it's certainly not one of our bigger segments, but the interesting thing about Professional is that it's the place where we've seen the shift to digital in the marketplace in that segment faster, the fastest, so in some ways it's sort of, if you use the analogy the tip of the spear, as we start to demonstrate that capability. But I would tell you that if you were then to say, okay, which large segment is becoming most like Professional, we would say right after that's probably our Higher Ed business in the U.S. It's not as digital as yet. It's maybe about half this penetration that we're seeing in Professional, but we're starting to see accelerated growth in that area. So I think what you're going to see is the change not so much in terms of our ability to sell, but the readiness of customers to accept and want and demand digital products.", "Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "What's the state of digital at the schools?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "That's a good one. It's clearly fragmented and clearly growing. One of the things that we launched last year that's doing very well is with our relationship with Apple, 5 titles on the iPad, and that was aimed at high schools. Other programs like the CINCH Math and CINCH Science and things like that are also doing very well. But there has to be a funding receptivity in that. And what we're really seeing is replacement where some of these programs are replacing more traditional product. Jack mentioned the Higher Ed area as well. By the way, just in terms of the Apple relationship, Ed, we've got 50 programs on the iPad in the Professional area now. This having to do with science, engineering, medical, in these areas. Fabulous programs. And we have 70 titles at the Higher Ed side on the iPad now and it's getting increasing receptivity in going in that direction. But for Higher Education, as you know, our big programs have been McGraw-Hill Connect, McGraw-Hill Campus, McGraw-Hill Create. These have all been direct solutions to specific, either home study or homework helping or actually curriculum-support initiatives. So I mean you can extrapolate it out, but the digital component of this is just growing ever so quickly, and the capability that we have gratifies us on this. Now we got to get some help in the markets, especially in K-12, on that part. But where we can see people replacing product, traditional product, you're going to start to see even more receptivity.", "Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "I was going to ask about that. What is the receptivity at the schools? Are the teachers happy? The parents? I know instances where schools are using a lot of digital at the local levels.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "It depends on -- it obviously depends on the school and all of that. But clearly, parent receptivity is high. Teacher training becomes a bit of an issue and one of the things that we have to be able to do is to help support that whole function. But certainly, there's no pushback on it. It's really, from a district standpoint, much more of a funding of the replacement.", "Robert S. Merritt", "That wraps up today's conference call. We appreciate your attendance and look forward to speaking to you in the future.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes this morning's call.

[Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Good morning. We thank you for joining us this morning at The McGraw-Hill Companies' Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. I'm Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our results. We trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com. Once again, that's www.mcgraw-hill.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's.", "The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results of the prior year quarter also reflect the reclassification of the Broadcasting Group as a discontinued operation.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Patti Rockenwagner in our New York office at (212) 512-3533 subsequent to this call.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO of McGraw-Hill Companies. Terry?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thank you very much, Chip, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's conference call. Joining me today on the conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review our corporate results, provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress, provide a detailed look at the segment results that make up what will be McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education, and then provide an outlook for the balance of the year.", "Three months ago, I was able to share record first quarter earnings. I couldn't be more pleased today to share with you our record second quarter earnings. What makes these results particularly noteworthy is that they occurred during a period of tremendous volatility in the debt markets as a result of European debt crisis and in a year in which we are experiencing the weakest state funding for textbooks in the past decade. To say the least, our employees are to be commended for delivering these results in today's very challenging global economic environment while simultaneously advancing the separation and implementing major cost reduction programs.", "During the second quarter, despite revenue that was modestly below a year ago, we delivered adjusted operating profit growth of 14% from both increased revenue in Commodities & Commercial, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Indices, as well as an acceleration of cost reductions that were realized during the quarter. Our recent aggressive share repurchase program amplified this growth. And we delivered 25% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth, and Jack will provide additional detail on that in just a moment.", "The primary focus of the company remains this: on delivering on the Growth and Value Plan. As part of this effort, we continue to progress toward the creation of 2 powerful new companies: one, McGraw-Hill Education; and the other, McGraw-Hill Financial, and doing so in 2012. Steady progress has been made on the Growth and Value Plan during the second quarter. Key management has been put in place at McGraw-Hill Education, and that includes Buzz Waterhouse as President and CEO and Pat Milano as CFO and Chief Administrative Officer. Buzz brings a wealth of both technology and education experience, while Pat brings the financial expertise, coupled with a deep knowledge of McGraw-Hill given his long tenure. Both are terrific leaders, and I can't say enough about them and the team that we've put in place.", "The Form 10 registration statement was filed with the SEC several weeks ago. Consolidated cost reductions accelerated in the second quarter, with total company adjusted expenses decreasing 5% versus the second quarter of 2011, resulting in an increase in margins. These cost reduction actions and others currently underway keep us on track to delivering at least $100 million in cost savings on a run-rate basis by year-end.", "Also, as part of the Growth and Value Plan, we are working on more than just cost reduction and separation. Strategic investments are an important component, and we made several during the quarter to accelerate long-term growth. We launched the S&P Dow Jones Indices, combining 2 iconic brands that will continue to deliver index-based solutions for global investors. It is a very exciting joint venture with a wonderful partner in the CME and should deliver annual revenues in 2013, in its first full year, of approximately $0.5 billion with great margins. Since the deal closed in late June, the impact on the second quarter earnings was minimal.", "We acquired Credit Market Analysis Limited, or CMA, a leading provider of clear, reliable over-the-counter credit pricing and related information from the CME. This adds another foundational benchmark capability to our portfolio. The business will be reported within S&P Capital IQ.", "Our India-based credit rating agency, CRISIL, announced the acquisition of Coalition Development Ltd. Coalition provides high-end analytics primarily to global investment banks. It is a London-based company with considerable operations in India.", "From a corporate development standpoint, we have been very active in adding new capabilities to the company. Along with S&P Dow Jones Indices, CMA and Coalition, which I've just discussed, we had acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse earlier this year, both in S&P Capital IQ.", "Overall, the Growth and Value Plan is a comprehensive set of integrated initiatives which includes separation, cost reduction, share repurchases, as well as funding both organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions. I am pleased with the progress so far this year, and I'm excited about the prospects for the future of both companies as we complete this process.", "With that, let me turn to the business results, and I'll go through each of the various business areas. Let me start.", "McGraw-Hill Financial, on a pro forma basis, delivered a 5% increase in revenue and a 9% increase in adjusted operating profit during the quarter. While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, along with Commodities & Commercial, that provided the operating profit growth. Cost-reduction benefits were realized across all segments. McGraw-Hill Financial derived 40% of its revenues from outside the United States during the second quarter. Domestic revenue growth of 7% outpaced international growth of 3%, which was impacted by volatile conditions in Europe and adverse foreign exchange rates.", "Standard & Poor's Ratings continues to be the segment with the largest international presence in terms of dollars, with 46% of revenue coming from outside the United States. Standard & Poor's Ratings is the largest business segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. Revenue for the segment grew 1%, with a 7% increase in domestic revenue and a 6% decrease in international revenue. Nearly all of the decrease in international revenue was a result of foreign exchange rates. However, these rate changes had a negligible impact on operating profit. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, total revenue for the segment would've increased 3%. The operating margin was down year-over-year but improved versus the first quarter.", "Transaction revenue increased 4% to $203 million. The key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were the U.S. public finance issuance, which increased 58%. You may recall that the muni market was adversely impacted back in the second quarter of 2011 by the perceived risk of a wave of muni defaults which did not come to fruition. The U.S. structured finance issuance, which increased 22% due to the growth in asset-backed securities and also CLOs, collateralized loan obligations. It is certainly encouraging to see the growth in structured products, and we look for that to continue. U.S. corporate investment-grade issuance, which remained resilient and increased 7%. Offsetting this growth was U.S. corporate speculative-grade issuance, which decreased 39% as investments became more risk averse; European corporate issuance, which decreased 36%; and European structured finance issuance, which decreased 60%.", "Non-transaction revenue, which represents 58% of second quarter revenue, decreased 2%, primarily due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, non-transaction revenue increased 2%.", "It is becoming increasingly apparent that global debt issuance trends are diverging. While trends in the United States are increasingly encouraging, the picture in Europe continues to be quite volatile. With the exception of strong issuance in January and February as a result of the injection of liquidity into the Eurozone banking system by the ECB, issuance activity has been rather subdued.", "However, over the long term, the Ratings business outlook appears very encouraging, with numerous secular drivers of growth, including a large pipeline of maturing global corporate debt that will need to be refinanced; the shift in Europe from bank loans to public debt markets as banks face new regulations, as well as capital requirements; and finally, the structured finance market, which should recover with improved activity in the residential and the commercial real estate markets.", "However, there are a number of issues that continue to create considerable volatility, and these include the European financial crisis, risk aversion among some investors, sovereign debt levels and pending government regulations which create uncertainty.", "Our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. The trends that we have discussed in the past quarterly conference calls continue. Two additional cases were dismissed in the second quarter, bringing the total dismissed to-date at 29 cases. Seven dismissals by lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts, and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. Among the dismissals was the Oddo litigation, which was affirmed by the highest court in New York. Several dozen cases remain outstanding. We continue to believe that the legal risk of pending litigation remains low.", "On the regulatory and government front, the Ratings business remains an area of focus for regulators, both in the United States and Europe. There are 3 principal items that we are monitoring. The first is CRA3 in Europe. That -- there remains the possibility of a mandatory rotation of rating agencies for structured finance products or a subset of these products. There's also a proposal for a new EU-wide liability standard, enabling investors who purchase investments to sue a credit rating agency that breaches the EU regulations intentionally or through gross negligence. Next is Dodd-Frank, which requires all U.S. regulations be changed to remove any reference to, or requirement of, reliance on credit ratings. Last is the Franken amendment, which is being studied by the SEC. This amendment recommends establishing an organization to assign which NRSRO will provide the initial rating on each new structured finance product. As new regulations are considered in the global markets that we serve, we will continue to provide investors with high-quality forward-looking opinions about creditworthiness.", "In addition, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice and the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating potential violation of civil provisions of federal law regarding and relating to S&P's ratings of structured products. Of course, we have been in discussions with representatives of both the DOJ and the SEC and presenting our position on those issues.", "The Ratings segment is now past its toughest revenue comparisons of the year, although we have a difficult expense comparison ahead of us in the third quarter, especially with the exchange rate issues. With the investments that we have made in the business, along with our repositioning of our commercial mortgage-backed securities offering, we continue to work towards improved performance of this very, very important business.", "Okay, with that, let me now turn to S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices, the second largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial. It delivered solid top and bottom line results, with revenue and adjusted operating profit increasing 10% and 17%, respectively. Both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Indices delivered year-over-year revenue growth, with 74% of revenue coming from subscriptions, the same as a year ago.", "Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone, revenue increased 9%. A key driver of this growth was double-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ subscriptions, with solid growth at both Desktop Solutions, as well as Enterprise Solutions. In addition, both RatingsXpress and Global Credit Portal contributed to the growth. And as I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we acquired Credit Market Analysis, or CMA. And with CMA, we significantly expanded our asset class coverage for data and pricing and added technology to move into live intraday coverage of derivatives and other over-the-counter securities.", "We are continuously working to upgrade the S&P Capital IQ platform, and there have been a number of new products and capabilities that have been launched recently. One that I would like to touch on briefly is in the area of counterparty risk. We have expanded the capabilities for measuring counterparty risk in the S&P Capital IQ platform. S&P Capital IQ credit analytics offers new capabilities for clients to produce even more dynamic risk measures to support their counterparty analysis. With new and enhanced features for CreditModel, CreditPro and Credit Risk Tracker products, clients can stay on top of market movements in the credit risk space quickly and efficiently. And lastly, the integration of our recent acquisitions of R2 and QuantHouse are progressing well. We have effectively empowered R2 and QuantHouse to lead our efforts in the development of next-generation cross-asset class portfolio analytics and low latency data capabilities, respectively.", "S&P Indices revenues increased 12%. We realized growth in trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives, as well as in assets under management, for both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices. Despite a turbulent stock market during the quarter, assets under management in the exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices increased 7% to $349 billion. This was driven by a 10% increase in the number of exchange-traded fund units, which more than offset a decline in the net asset value per unit. During the quarter, 17 brand-new indices and 27 variants to existing indices were launched. Also, during the quarter, 11 new exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices were launched, bringing the total of exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices to 430. These additions create new alternatives for investors and greater liquidity, obviously, to markets.", "At the end of the quarter, we launched the S&P Dow Jones Indices. This is our new joint venture with the CME Group. Here, you can see the full-page ad that ran in the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal announcing the launch. Alex Matturri, a veteran of the index industry, who has been running our index business for a number of years, was named the CEO of S&P Dow Jones Indices. This joint venture will enable our clients to create investment products that offer new choices to investors. As a result of our 73% ownership of the joint venture, we will, for the first time, participate in the profitability of CME's execution and clearing.", "With the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture now in place, there are approximately $1.5 trillion directly linked to our indices and over 400 financial institutions that use our indices to build or price funds, swaps, notes, options, forwards and futures. We are proud that the S&P Dow Jones Indices is home to some of the most widely followed and most trusted indices in the world.", "Now let me turn to the Commodities & Commercial group, which delivered year-over-year operating profit gains that led all segments. Revenue growth was 9%, with international revenue up 16%. The leverage of the business is very evident and, along with cost reductions, resulted in operating margins that increased almost 700 basis points to over 29%.", "Within Commodities, subscriptions for petroleum, natural gas and steel products drove the 19% increase in revenue. We have capitalized on the acquisitions of BENTEK Energy and the Steel Business Briefing Group to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities. In addition, due to volatility in the oil markets, we realized revenue growth from increased trading of future contracts linked to Platts' pricing. Our Commodities business is now approaching $0.5 billion on an annualized basis and is poised for further growth.", "Commercial's revenue decreased 1%. J.D. Power's revenue growth was offset by modest declines in the remainder of the portfolio. The revenue growth at J.D. Power was a result of growth in the Power Information Network, or PIN, Ad Claims and syndicated reports. The widely followed J.D. Power initial quality study was released this quarter in its 26th year. This study is purchased by virtually all of the world's major automotive manufacturers and results in meaningful ad claims from many of the companies whose automobiles rank highest in each category. I'm pleased to say J.D. Power is on its way to its best year ever.", "Okay, with that, let me turn to Education -- in McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education reported a 12% decline in revenue yet delivered a 36% increase in segment operating profit. The revenue decline occurred largely at School Education Group. We continue to expect a 10% decline in the K-12 market this year, which will represent, in our opinion, the lowest spending level in over a decade and gives us opportunities looking ahead. Despite this difficult market, the segment delivered cost reductions that overcame the revenue shortfall, enabled us to deliver solid growth in operating profit. Our focus is to ensure that the business has a cost structure that is appropriate for such challenging market realities and provides the flexibility to invest to accelerate digital development. Product development continues to focus on providing innovative digital learning materials for our customers. As a result of the increased sales of digital products, many of which are subscription-based, our deferred revenue has become more pronounced, increasing by approximately $50 million year-over-year.", "The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 2% decrease in revenue. Revenue growth at Higher Education was offset by declines at International, which was almost entirely due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Higher Education now has 1.4 million digital users, an increase of 40%, as digital products continue to displace books.", "One noteworthy product, McGraw-Hill Connect, which is a homework management platform, grew by 65%. It enables instructors to create assignments and track student performance and provides a range of digital learning tools, such as LearnSmart, that improves student learning. LearnSmart is an adaptive learning system that is available for approximately 150 different college course titles.", "The School Education Group reported a 20% decline, and that was in revenue from the prior year, with decreases occurring in both instructional materials and testing. The key third quarter selling season is underway, and our view of the market, as I said a moment ago, remains unchanged. We continue to believe 2012 will be the low watermark in the K-12 space, and the market should begin to show a modest recovery as we get into 2013.", "Over the next couple of years, we anticipate that a demand for our Common Core-compliant materials will increase as school districts prepare for the new tests that take effect in the spring of 2015. 46 states have adopted the Common Core State Standards and need to prepare their students for these new tests. Our testing business was selected by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium to develop its suite of language, arts and mathematics test items for the new Common Core Assessments. Smarter Balanced is 1 of 2 state web consortia funded by the U.S. Department of Education to develop assessment tools to help states gauge student progress towards meeting the new Common Core Standards. Together, with a co-contractor, we are also developing test items for the second federally funded test consortium, which is called the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers.", "We're setting up the Education business to thrive as a stand-alone company. We're putting in place the cost structure and digital capabilities necessary for the McGraw-Hill Education to lead the transformation of the industry. And we are absolutely thrilled to have Buzz Waterhouse and Pat Milano in place to lead this effort, along with the entire team.", "In summary, The McGraw-Hill Companies is off to a very strong start with record first half adjusted diluted earnings per share. McGraw-Hill Financial should continue to deliver solid top and bottom line growth. We continue to build new capabilities to deliver organic growth while pursuing bolt-on acquisitions to add additional expertise and capabilities or move into new markets.", "McGraw-Hill Education will focus on all that is required to become a stand-alone company. We are creating a cost structure that is rightsized to serve the education market and building out our unique set of digital products to meet the needs of our customers. Our intent is to position this business for longer-term growth as the market recovers and the digital shift accelerates.", "The company will remain focused on delivering on its Growth and Value Plan and continue to work towards the completion of the spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education by the end of the year. And to say the least, 2012 will be remembered as a very important inflection point in our company's history. And I'm very pleased with the results of both the first and, now, the second quarter record results.", "Okay, let me leave it there. That completes my prepared remarks, and I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some of our key financials. Jack?", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to provide additional detail on our consolidated results, including cash flow, and provide additional detail on the progress in one-time costs in the implementation of the Growth and Value Plan.", "Let me begin by discussing our consolidated results. Revenue decreased 1% year-over-year. However, it was more than offset by a 5% year-over-year decrease in overall adjusted expenses. The decrease in expenses was primarily the result of the Growth and Value Plan cost-reduction initiatives that began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and will continue into next year. As a result, consolidated adjusted operating profit increased 14% and consolidated adjusted operating margins increased over 300 basis points to 26.3%. Obviously, we are pleased with the progress thus far in margin expansion.", "To summarize the operating results Terry just reviewed, there was continued revenue growth at McGraw-Hill Financial of 5%, with margins that expanded 140 basis points, delivering strong adjusted operating profit growth of 9%. For McGraw-Hill Education, while there was a 12% decline in revenue, margins expanded 420 basis points based on the meaningful cost initiatives that began with the significant restructuring of the business in the fourth quarter of last year. Both businesses did benefit from a reduction in employee-related costs due to the realignment of our retirement programs.", "The share repurchase program remains an important aspect of the Growth and Value Plan, and the impact was evident again this quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced shares outstanding by 24 million shares. This amplified a 15% increase in adjusted net income to a 25% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share or $0.85 per share. Since the beginning of 2011 through the second quarter of 2012, the company has repurchased nearly 36 million shares at a weighted average price of $42.05. This reduced shares outstanding by approximately 12%. Apart from the completion of the accelerated share repurchase program in April, no other shares were repurchased in the quarter. However, we do anticipate resuming share repurchases over the back half of the year, which will provide continued EPS leverage into next year.", "We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, with approximately $840 million in cash and short-term investments. Year-over-year, our free cash flow was down. This decrease was largely the result of a temporary acceleration of payments of approximately $100 million to the vendors associated with the transition to a new accounting system, as well as $65 million of cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan. On a full year basis, we fully expect to deliver solid free cash flow. Our guidance of approximately $750 million, excluding cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan, remains unchanged.", "Now let me provide some additional details around the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. The actions taken over the last several quarters drove, in part, the cost reductions that were realized in the second quarter. Year-over-year, total adjusted expenses decreased 5%. As I mentioned earlier, one important component of this was the realignment of our U.S. pension plan that took effect on April 1.", "As we form 2 new companies, we need to separate several critical support operations that are currently shared. The next important round of cost savings will benefit from the realignment of these operations. We currently have 15 work streams underway to implement cost savings in the area of accounting, purchasing, information technology, human resources and real estate. We are already deep in the implementation of these plans, and we anticipate the realization of these cost reduction benefits by the time separation occurs in the latter part of this year.", "During the second quarter, we incurred $42 million of one-time Growth and Value Plan costs that we noted in this morning's press release. They include $19 million for professional fees, $15 million for deal fees and $8 million for severance. We anticipate that for the remainder of the year, we will incur an additional $80 million of one-time separation expenses necessary to implement the Growth and Value Plan. These one-time expenses are largely professional fees, as we need to support various consultants, business process and information technology firms and financial advisors. Please keep in mind, this is a working estimate. In addition, we anticipate that during 2012, we will continue to incur restructuring costs as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives. While the timing of these actions is still fluid, restructuring expense for 2012 could be up to approximately $65 million over the balance of the year.", "The Form 10 was filed several weeks ago and outlined many aspects of the separation. There are a few key financial items that I would like to draw your attention to. McGraw-Hill Financial will retain all of the outstanding long-term debt, as well as substantially all of the cash on hand at the time of the spin. Concurrent with the spin, we anticipate that McGraw-Hill Education will issue up to $600 million in new debt, likely a mix of bank term loans and public debt. McGraw-Hill Education will retain approximately $100 million of cash and issue a one-time dividend to McGraw-Hill Financial for up to $500 million. McGraw-Hill Education will also establish a revolving credit line. This, along with the $100 million of newly raised cash, should provide McGraw-Hill Education with ample liquidity to meet its business needs. Along with receiving the one-time dividend of up to $500 million, McGraw-Hill Financial will retain all of the pension liabilities, which are now largely frozen plans for both companies, as well as other selected liabilities, to simplify separation. In the spin, our goal is to provide the Education business with balance sheet flexibility to support its long-term growth potential.", "As we now look to the back half of the year, there are a couple items that I want to point out. First, as I mentioned earlier, we plan on resuming share repurchases. Our plan is to repurchase up to 500 million in the second half of the year. As always, share repurchases are subject to appropriate market conditions.", "Another item that I want to highlight is the financial impact of our new joint venture, S&P Dow Jones Indices. The transaction was closed at the end of June, and as such, our balance sheet reflects $792 million of additional net assets. It was closed on the last business day in the quarter, such that the income statement impact was negligible. We anticipate that by the end of the third quarter, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest line on the income statement will become more prominent. Since we own 73% of the joint venture, we will consolidate the entire business in our income statement. 27% of the joint venture net income is then removed and recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Obviously, we will review the impact of this exciting new venture with CME once there are operating results to review on the third quarter call.", "In closing, our outlook for the balance of 2012 remains positive. We are executing upon the Growth and Value Plan that we laid out late last year. At the same time, we delivered record first half adjusted earnings per share. While there is an inclination to raise guidance after such a strong first half, we need to be mindful that the third quarter, our largest of the year, is still ahead of us. This is the key quarter for McGraw-Hill Education as schools across the U.S. purchase the lion's share of educational materials for the upcoming school year. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to keep our guidance unchanged, with diluted adjusted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.35, although based on the strong first half, we now anticipate being near the high end of that range. Our cost reduction efforts will continue, and we fully expect to deliver on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of the year. Executing on all the aspects of the Growth and Value Plan remains our highest priority. And we continue to anticipate completing the separation into 2 powerful industry leaders, McGraw-Hill Education and McGraw-Hill Financial, by year-end. We are doing all the work to support a spin of McGraw-Hill Education by year-end. We are also evaluating other options to deliver shareholder value, including a potential sale. We will update the market as appropriate in the coming months.", "With that, thank you for joining the call this morning. And now let me turn the call back over to Chip Merritt to moderate the Q&A.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Thank you, Jack. [Operator Instructions] And now, operator, if you would, please, we'll take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from William Bird with Lazard.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Just 2 questions. First, on a GAAP basis, how much of the $100 million in cost savings do you expect to fall in 2012? And second, about how much leverage are you comfortable with for McGraw-Hill Financial post-spin?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Bill, first of all, in terms of the cost savings and in terms of being able to realize those savings, we will realize those cost savings in 2012. And again, not to be nebulous about it, but we're seeing at least $100 million. And we believe, as we go through all of the reductions and shared costs and all of those things as we go through the separation process, that there'll be more. But I think it's safe to say, at this point, at least $100 million is a good way to do it. Leverage...", "John F. Callahan", "Sorry to interrupt. The -- on a run rate basis, absolutely, at least $100 million by the fourth quarter. In terms of actual flow through the P&L within 2012, I would say about 2/3 would flow within the P&L this year. And obviously, that $400 million would benefit both businesses as we go into next year. And again, that excludes the one-time impact of the costs that we highlighted today around the separation expenses.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "That's right. And that -- and again, at least $100 million. And also in terms of leverage, it's way too early to tell at this point. I mean, obviously, we've got a very clean balance sheet. And relative to organic growth projects, transactions, shares repurchased and things like that, we will have ample capability to do whatever we need to do on that part. So we have a very clean balance sheet.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And just to clarify on the cost saves, how much have you realized in the P&L year-to-date?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, if I go back to my comment a minute ago, that we anticipate at least 2/3 to benefit the P&L within the full year. I would say a little less than half that has already been reflected in the P&L year-to-date.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "And given the conditions that we're facing at this point, obviously, in terms of some of the lower revenue growth and the higher profit growth, obviously, cost reductions are having a significant impact.", "John F. Callahan", "And obviously, we're also benefiting from -- the Education business is obviously benefiting from the very significant cost restructuring they did in the fourth quarter, where we eliminated -- last year, we eliminated 10% of all positions. That, obviously, is also adding incremental benefits.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Could you also comment on just what you're seeing in terms of the Ratings pipeline right now?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. I mean, as we said, what we're seeing on the structured finance side, we're starting to see some pickup on the commercial and a little bit on the residential side. Obviously, the public finance market is quite strong. Bigger than that, Bill, is that you're looking at -- in terms of nonfinancial corporate securities over the next 5 years, you're looking at $46 trillion of refinancing and new monies on that part. So we're starting to see some pickup on that side. Obviously, investment grade is doing better than speculative grade, and that goes for both here in Europe and parts of Asia Pacific as well. But now, it will start to pick up, and we'll start to see more activity on that part. And the plus side is that we're seeing it on the structured finance area.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So Terry, the cost growth slowed considerably at S&P in the second quarter, which helped you generate some pretty good margins in the context of a tough revenue environment. Should that pattern replay, you think, in the second half of the year?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, I mean, you've got ongoing cost reduction in one area, but you're also rightsizing that a little bit. But the big area is the foreign exchange. And again, especially coming out of Europe, our revenues were impacted by foreign exchange. But also positively, the expense base is also affected that way. So we'll have to see how the currency markets play itself through, but we're obviously benefiting on the cost side with foreign exchange.", "John F. Callahan", "And Peter, I would just add that looking forward over the balance of the year, as Terry mentioned in his remarks, we have a tough expense overlap, particularly in the third quarter. So I'd be -- we're cautious as we look at the third quarter. But on a full year basis, we -- our anticipation is that the margins would remain 40% or better on a full year basis.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And could I ask just 2 other questions, please? The S&P Dow Jones Index business, Jack, you mentioned this, I think, in your part of the call. I'm just trying to figure out, how big is the incremental contribution from that in the second half of the year? That's question one. And then question two, unrelated to that, Jack, you also mentioned the exploring the possible sale of the Education business. If you went that route, obviously, you'd be left with considerable cash balances. How would we -- how should we think about the potential use of that cash?", "John F. Callahan", "Yes, 2 quick questions. I mean, for the JV over the balance of the year, from an earnings-per-share point of view, we think it'll be accretive $0.01 or $0.02. And on the third quarter call, once we actually have real operating results, we'll detail that much more than we can today. And then I'll be honest, we're very focused on trying to determine the right strategic path for the Education business spin or, potentially, sale or other option. Obviously, in a sale, we would have a fairly significant cash infusion. We haven't spent a lot of time, quite honestly, trying to sort out what we would do with that. Obviously, it's a high-class issue for us to consider. I would think you should expect some part of that would be consistent with our return of capital policy that we have as part of the Growth and Value Plan.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "And obviously, again, we're in a very, very sensitive period with the Education business because we have to make sure that we're prepared for the spin, and we are. And standing up the Education business as a stand-alone has taken all the attention on that part. Obviously, being responsive, as a public company, to every other interest as well, we are going through a process on that as well. But the most important part is that this is a 2012 event and that it is going to be a stand-alone business, and we have to make sure that -- in every possible way, that it is capable of being able to deliver on its strategic mission. Now in terms of, as Jack said, proceeds and everything else, you can look at the key components. It will definitely have some transaction component to it. It will definitely have some organic, especially as we continue to build out on areas like Platts and S&P Dow Jones Indices and things like that, and also the geographic expansion at Ratings on that, but also in terms of share repurchase as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.", "Craig Huber", "I have a very specific question first. On the transaction line in your Ratings business, given these various city bankruptcies of late, and I've noticed a number of downgrades out there as well over the last 6 months or so, an increasing number itself, how concerned are you about the public finance market out there? I know it's not going very strong now, given low rates and how we should accomplish year-over-year. But how concerned are you guys and your analysts that this could materially impact, if this continues, debt issuance on the U.S. finance?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, well, I mean, it's very strong for a very good reason. I mean, you've got so many states that are having difficulties, and as we were saying, non-transaction revenue represented 58% of the second quarter revenue in all of that. And again, that was a lot to do with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. But we're not -- I mean, we're all concerned in terms of the lack of growth and some of the economic conditions and all of that. We're all influenced by that. But clearly, you're going to see more public finance issuance on that one, and it's a critical phase, and we're watching it very carefully. And again, from a creditworthiness standpoint, we will be extremely diligent in terms of stating exactly what we see.", "Craig Huber", "But again, this pickup in city bankruptcies out there, you're not overly concerned of what that could do for debt issuance in the muni market for a period of time?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "No, we're not overly concerned.", "Craig Huber", "Okay. And also, on the non-transaction line for the entire Ratings business, can you just talk about -- and I know it's up here 2% in the quarter, adjusting for currency, but just what your outlook is there in the back half of the year, and also about any potential price increases, what you're doing there?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, well, I mean, again, from our standpoint, and there would be modest price increases, but again, what you really have to focus on is the currency side of it. The strengthening U.S. dollar is obviously influencing it. But excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, we see an increase in the non-transaction revenue.", "John F. Callahan", "And I would -- our current forecast assumes sort of low single-digit growth in that area over the balance of the year. So obviously, to Terry's point, currency, and then, obviously, how active the markets are on the transaction side will drive the business for the next 6 months.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, that's right, low single-digit net modest increases.", "Craig Huber", "And then, I'm sorry, back to this other question earlier with the Dow Jones Indices JV, can you ballpark the revenue impact or the positive impact? Or is it roughly say $20 million with you guys on a quarterly basis? Could you just ballpark it for us?", "John F. Callahan", "I'd put it closer to $25 million plus.", "Craig Huber", "Per quarter?", "John F. Callahan", "Per quarter, yes. So for the balance of the year, somewhere between $50 million to $60 million.", "Craig Huber", "Okay. My last question, please. On Education, could you just update us on your latest thoughts on the digital migration both on el-hi, as well as college, what you think it actually means to your profits, profit dollars, not margins, not revenues, with the actual profits at the end of the day, the dollar impact, please?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, that -- I mean, that is where it's coming from. And it's happening very, very rapidly, and in particular, at the Higher Education level. As you know, with some of the transformation, with the Apple partnership and things like that, both Professional and Higher Education have significant title expansion in that area, and that will flow this year and next year to increases on the profitability. The K-12 area is still one that is -- it's very fragmented. We have pushed very hard on the high school market in terms of new title capabilities and the like. But again, because of state and local municipality economic conditions, it will remain fragmented. But the Higher Ed and the Professional side, it'll be a direct contribution.", "John F. Callahan", "I'd squeeze in this point as an example. Obviously, it's much smaller because it's not Higher Ed. But the Professional business, while it's a small business, it's our most digitally advanced, and we have continued to build profitability in that business. So we have some experience in managing through this transition. It will obviously work differently in the Education markets, in Higher Ed or K-12 going forward, but we're working our way through that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Arthur with Evercore.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Yes, Terry, going back to S&P Ratings, and particularly focusing on transaction revenues, irrespective of the currency hit, I don't think I've ever seen a quarter where there was such a divergence between U.S. activity and particularly European, and I guess that's for the obvious reasons that we all read about every day. Do you -- how do you see that playing out, particularly in Europe, over the second half of the year? More of the same?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "I'd say you're probably right, Doug. It is more the same, although I think you'll start to see a little pickup in the structured finance area on that one, and we're looking to that. But again, the European environment is so difficult right now. I would say that it would probably be more of the same.", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from David Reynolds with Jefferies.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "David Reynolds here from Jefferies. I wondered if I could just ask a question about McGraw-Hill Education. Clearly, you're pursuing a variety of strategic options for the business going forward. Perhaps you could just share your expertise with us, really, with regard to how -- how do you think about valuation for businesses like McGraw-Hill Education?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, first of all, if you take a look at the overall appetite and the need and the criticality of it, and the second one, take a look at the industry serving it on that part, McGraw-Hill Education is one of the most comprehensive and most powerful scaled capabilities and the like. As we're going through some very, very interesting changes in terms of the digital composition and how education is being focused on, both at the Higher Education and at the advanced level, as well as in the elementary, secondary school area, you're seeing some fundamental change taking place. Ours is, is that with McGraw-Hill Education, the digital transformation has to be accelerated. We have to continue to push aggressively on that. And as an industry, you're seeing that. I think that our capability and the team that we've got, we've been able to demonstrate making that kind of change more rapidly. And I think that judgment of anybody in the industry is going to be on their ability to develop a digital product very, very quickly and comprehensively.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And could I just follow that up? How critical do you believe is the internationalization of your Education business strategically going forward?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "I think it's very important, and especially when you're talking about emerging markets. 2/3 of world GDP growth is coming from something called emerging markets. And our ability to be able to interface with that, and in particular, on the Professional and Higher Ed side, it's going to be a big component of growth going forward.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenters' slides is available now for downloading from www.mcgraw-hill.com. A replay of this call, including the Q&A session, will be available in about 2 hours.

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] To access the webcast and slides, go to www.mcgraw-hill.com and click on the link for the third quarter earnings webcast. [Operator Instructions]", "I'd now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us for McGraw-Hill's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued a news release with our results. We trust you've all had a chance to review it. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com. Once again, that's www.mcgraw-hill.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Patti Rockenwagner in our New York office at (212) 512-3533.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. Terry?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thank you very much, Chip. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's conference call. Joining me on today's conference call is Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Jack and I will review our corporate results. We're going to provide an update on our Growth and Value Plan progress. We'll provide a detailed look at the segment results that make up what will be McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education and then, provide an outlook for the balance of the year.", "Now, like many other New York companies, we delayed our earnings report from Wednesday to today to accommodate employees and shareholders impacted by Hurricane Sandy. And thankfully, all of our employees are safe, and our business continuity plans are operating effectively. Our employees have really stepped up to work through the many challenges, and I'm grateful to them and to the state and city workers who have done so much to help us over this past week. And I hope those of you on the phone affected by the storm are safe and starting the process to return to some state of normality as well.", "All right. Let me begin by saying that we are pleased by the success of our Growth and Value Plan and the strong results of the McGraw-Hill Financial businesses. Now while the Education company is facing some very tough current challenges in the U.S. education sector, we feel very excited by the promise of digital learning and by our new digital products and services, which are improving learning outcomes for students everywhere. And this digital transformation is gaining momentum, and we'll talk about that in just a little bit.", "During the third quarter, the company delivered a 2% increase in revenue. McGraw-Hill Financial, which realized a boost from the robust global issuance, delivered a 15% increase in revenue. Separately, McGraw-Hill Education delivered an 11% decrease in revenue as it managed the impact of the weakest level of state funding for K-12 textbooks in the past decade. Adjusted operating profit increased 3%, and due to our aggressive share repurchase program, we delivered 10% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, and Jack will provide a little additional financial detail on that in just a moment.", "A little over a year ago, we made a set of commitments in this Growth and Value Plan, and I'm proud of the substantial progress that our employees have made on each of these commitments. And let me take a moment and just walk through these different commitments and give you an update as to where we are.", "The first and most visible commitment is the separation of the company into 2 industry-leading companies, McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education; and we are on track to do so. Amendment #2 to the Form 10 SEC Registration Statement for the potential spinoff of McGraw-Hill Education was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month, and we don't anticipate any substantial issues with that.", "In parallel with our efforts to spin off McGraw-Hill Education, we have undertaken a thorough evaluation process of numerous options, including the option to sell the business. This process is near its conclusion, and we expect to reach a decision in the coming weeks. Critical to this decision is ensuring that we choose the option that maximizes shareholder value. The timing of the ultimate separation will be dictated by which option is chosen.", "We have also committed to more than $100 million in run rate cost reductions by the end of the year. We're on track for this, and Jack will provide some color on this in just a moment. We committed to aggressively repurchasing shares, and after completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase program earlier this year, we reentered the market in the third quarter and purchased an additional $295 million of McGraw-Hill stock.", "Lastly, we committed to investing for growth. Earlier this year, we formed the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture. Importantly, this is the first quarter that we have managed and reported the combined results for some of the most widely followed and trusted brands in the index space. We believe this joint venture will prove to be a great value not only to our customers, but also our shareholders.", "In addition, earlier this year, the company acquired R2 Financial Technologies, QuantHouse, Credit Market Analysis Limited and Coalition Development Ltd. And most recently, we announced the acquisition of Kingsman SA, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. So whether it's through the separation process, cost reductions, share repurchases or investing in growth, McGraw-Hill is meeting its Growth and Value Plan commitments and is on target and on track to do so.", "With that, let me now turn to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial on a pro forma basis delivered a 15% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in adjusted operating profit during the quarter. Of the 15% revenue growth, 11% was organic and 4% was from the transactions that I just mentioned.", "While all 3 segments delivered revenue growth, it was Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Commodities & Commercial markets that provided the most impressive adjusted operating profit growth of 28% and 29%, respectively, as well as improved adjusted operating margins. McGraw-Hill Financial delivered 40% of its revenue from outside the United States during the third quarter. Domestic revenue growth of 17% outpaced International growth of 12%, which was impacted by adverse foreign exchange rates.", "Standard & Poor's Ratings continues to be the segment with the largest international presence, with 45% of its revenue coming from outside the United States. Standard & Poor's Ratings also delivered the largest revenue increase within McGraw-Hill Financial and delivered its strongest quarterly revenue since the third quarter of 2007. Revenue for this segment grew 22%, with a 33% increase in domestic revenue and a 12% increase in international revenue. The increase in international revenue occurred despite a 7% negative impact from foreign exchange rates. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 28%, and the corresponding operating margin increased almost 200 basis points.", "Actions during the quarter by both the European Central Bank, the ECB, and the Federal Reserve resulted in increased global bond issuance. The ECB's pledge to intervene in the sovereign bond markets and the Federal Reserves' Quantitative Easing 3 program caused global spreads to contract and fueled a surge in September bond issuance. These actions helped to drive U.S. speculative-grade corporate bond issuance to a record $85.4 billion in the third quarter.", "Transaction revenue increased 64% to $215 million. Recall that while issuance in the first half of 2011 was quite robust, it tapered off considerably in the second half of 2011, creating less difficult year-over-year comparisons in the second half of 2012. Nevertheless, the key drivers to the increase in transaction revenue were: one, worldwide corporate issuance, which increased 81%, with a 72% increase in U.S. corporate issuance and 126% increase in European corporate issuance; and secondly, the public finance issuance, which increased 9% and contributed to the growth as well.", "Additionally, worldwide structured issuance was flat, with a 65% increase in the United States' structured finance issuance offset by a 33% decline in European structured finance issuance. The European weakness was driven by a 37% decline in European covered bond issuance as issuers funded through the European Central Bank long-term refinancing option.", "Non-transaction revenue, which represented 57% of Standard & Poor's third quarter revenue, increased 3%. Now in periods of robust debt issuance, investors are frequently concerned about issuance being pulled forward. This is always a difficult point to determine until after the fact. However, a  study by Standard & Poor's Global Fixed Income Research to analyze corporate refunding needs over the next few years may be instructive.", "The study concluded that approximately $8 trillion in rated corporate debt will mature from 2012 to the end of 2016. Let me repeat that, that approximately $8 trillion in rated corporate debt will mature from 2012 to year-end 2016. Now the non-financial sector accounts for about $3.3 trillion of the $8 trillion in maturing debt, and financial companies, including banks and insurance companies, account for the remaining $4.8 trillion. Now this research clearly suggests that corporate debt needs will remain robust over the next several years.", "Our success on the litigation front has been encouraging. The trends that we have discussed in the past quarterly conference calls continue. To date, 30 cases have been dismissed. Nine dismissals by lower courts have been reaffirmed by higher courts, and 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. Again, we have said that the legal risk is low, and it's bearing that out.", "While aiding and abetting and negligent misrepresentation claims have been dropped in the Abu Dhabi case, the trial over fraud claims is set to begin in May. And again, we continue to believe that the legal risk of pending litigation remains very low.", "All right. With that, let me turn now to S&P Capital IQ and the S&P Dow Jones Indices. And again, this is the second largest segment within McGraw-Hill Financial, which delivered solid top line results with revenue growth of 13%. 72% of revenue came from subscriptions, the same as a year ago. International revenue increased 10% to $117 million, and that represents 30% of total segment revenue. Adjusted operating profit increased 5%, and there was a modest decline in the adjusted operating margin as the segment integrates and develops newly acquired technology and products into the S&P Capital IQ offerings.", "Looking at S&P Capital IQ alone. Revenue increased 9%, with organic revenue growth of 5%. Two key products, S&P Capital IQ within Desktop Solutions and Global Data Solutions within Enterprise Solutions both delivered solid growth. S&P Capital IQ delivered double-digit client and subscriber growth, which reached 4,400 clients and 55,000 subscriber new growth, respectively. These results were offset somewhat by revenue weakness from equity research.", "One of the top priorities at S&P Capital IQ is the execution of product innovation and driving integration of the newly acquired assets. On the innovation front, we believe that we are amassing considerable technical capabilities and are working to translate these into competitive advantage. We are pleased to have been recognized for the first time on Institutional Investors' annual 2012 Tech 50 List, coming in, in the 29th spot.", "In addition to integrating the technology, our strategy is to deploy an integrated sales effort that can assemble any combination of S&P Capital IQ products in a customized offering. In fact, in August, we won our first combination sale with an offering that included S&P Capital IQ, Standard & Poor's Ratings data via express feed and CMA credit default swaps.", "The big news is that the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture is up and is running. What a fantastic opportunity we have with this amazing collection of world-renowned brands. This business is all about building trusted and transparent brands, and we have some of the best.", "Having a partner like the CME is also incredibly important. The relationships it maintains with exchanges around the world provides several of our businesses with important access. This access has already been -- or has already enabled us a new opportunity with the BM&FBOVESPA in Brazil. The S&P 500 is being made available to them via a sublicense from the CME Group and the S&P Dow Jones Indices. The launch of a U.S.-dollar-denominated S&P 500 index future settled in the Brazilian real is the first derivative of a U.S. stock index to trade on the Brazilian exchange, the very first.", "S&P Indices reported revenue of $109 million in the third quarter, and excluding the addition of Dow Jones Indexes, revenue was $82 million and decreased 7%. Revenue from exchange-traded funds and mutual funds was very strong, with double-digit increases year-over-year. Assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices grew 40% year-over-year to $390 billion, and that includes the Dow Jones Indexes. Their assets under management reached $454 billion. Revenue from derivatives declined due to incredibly difficult comparisons to the third quarter of 2011. This was driven by trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives that decreased 41% versus third quarter 2011.", "This chart should put the difficult comparison into perspective. In the third quarter of 2011, derivative volumes reached a 5-year high as investors hedged their positions due to euro crisis concerns. Please note that with the formation of S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture, there is no longer a direct correlation between the E-mini futures trading volumes and the S&P Indices revenues as in the past. We now receive a percentage of profits from the CME equity complex rather than being paid on a per-contract basis.", "Let me now turn to the Commodities & Commercial markets segment, which delivered a year-over-year adjusted operating profit gain that, again, led all segments. Revenue growth was 5%, with international revenue up 15%. The leverage of the business is very evident. This leverage, coupled with a $5 million decrease in expenses, resulted in an adjusted operating margin that increased more than 500 basis points to 28%.", "Within Commodities, petroleum market subscriptions continued to be the primary growth driver. However, derivative trading in BENTEK Energy also delivered double-digit revenue growth. And Kingsman, which I mentioned earlier, Kingsman leverages Platts' presence in biofuels to make our first foray into the agricultural commodities. The acquisition, which closed yesterday, expands Platts' biofuels position by providing additional coverage, price assessments and subscriber base for the biodiesel and ethanol markets.", "In addition, agriculture is a natural extension from the biofuels market. It is large, it's sophisticated, it's a global commodity market like the others that Platts serves. Kingsman is a great first step into this marketplace, and Kingsman is not only a leader in biofuels, it is a leader in the sugar market, a key feedstock into the biofuels complex.", "Within Commercial, revenue decreased 2%. J.D. Power's revenue growth was offset by modest declines in the remainder of the portfolio. But simply stated, J.D. Power is poised for its best year ever. This is driven in part by the continued expansion of China's domestic automotive industry as well as J.D. Power's Power Information Network, proprietary research and automotive consulting. And as J.D. Power continues to pursue business beyond the automotive industry, there's an interesting piece of new business with the National Football League that has contracted with J.D. Power to conduct their voice of the fan tracking.", "With that, let me move over to McGraw-Hill Education. McGraw-Hill Education in the third quarter reported an 11% decline in revenue to $836 million. Revenue decreased at the Higher Education, Professional and International Group as well as the School Education Group. While both groups are operating in very difficult economic environments, the reported revenues are also impacted by increased deferred revenues resulting from growth in subscription products.", "As the Education business develops and sells more digital solutions, the traditional revenue model is changing, and it's changing rapidly. Rather than booking revenue at the time of a sale, revenue is spread out and recognized over the life of the subscription. Largely because of the dramatic increases in McGraw-Hill Education subscription businesses, its third quarter deferred revenue balance increased 74% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of this increase in deferred revenue, the third quarter revenue decline was only 7%. To combat the difficult business environment, McGraw-Hill Education reduced expenses 9% versus the third quarter of 2011 and continues to look for additional cost-reduction opportunities.", "The Higher Education, Professional and International Group reported a 6% decrease in revenue. Excluding the impact of increased deferred revenue, the decline was 5%. With difficult economic conditions around the globe, the vast majority of the revenue decline in this group was in international, with Higher Education revenue decreasing modestly. However, the continued migration to digital solution helps to mitigate these declines by offering growing revenue streams in all of its major markets.", "Student usage of our homework study solutions in the higher education market has grown by 67%, boosted by usage of LearnSmart, which grew 115% and now has more than 890,000 registered students. We recently launched a direct-to-consumer website which makes LearnSmart available for purchase by students even if their professors don't utilize it as part of their course. This is a divergence from the business-to-business model that typically has been deployed.", "The School Education Group reported a 16% decline in revenue from the prior year, and excluding the impact of increased deferred revenue, the decrease was 10%. K-12 revenue was down due to weak state funding, with 2012 expected to be the lowest funding year in the last decade. And according to the Association of American Publishers, the AAP, and their statistics, August year-to-date industry K-12 net sales were down 14%. McGraw-Hill Education captured a substantial share of 2012's 2 largest state adoption opportunities, and that's, of course, Florida's K-12 social studies and California's reading program, but could not overcome the overall decline in the rest of U.S. state funding.", "As we look beyond the immediate challenge of state funding for K-12 education, it is important to remember that a strong and innovative education sector is critical for a healthy economy, whether in the United States or around the world, so these current issues should be kept in context. That is why McGraw-Hill Education, driven by new management, is focused on responding to the critical need for education by driving operational excellence, reimagining learning and capturing the new growth opportunities. Indeed, we have made impressive progress over the last few years in developing digital learning products, and we believe there is a long runway of opportunities both in the developed and emerging countries.", "Our products are prime for the digital revolution in education. Virtually all of our content is available in digital form to enable personalized, adaptive learning solutions and improved outcomes. The education market will continue to grow meaningfully as digital devices of all kinds are becoming more prevalent around the world. Our Higher Education business, the CTB testing business and our Professional and International businesses are all well positioned to take advantage of this growth potential.", "In the K-12 market, we are encouraged that the new Common Core State Standards assessments begin in 2014. This should drive demand for both teaching materials and assessments as 46 states have formally adopted the standards of Common Core.  There is also a greater demand by parents and educators for improved performance, which should bode well for our adaptive -- digital learning programs that have demonstrated proven advancements in learning outcomes.", "One major element that is out of our control but clearly impacts the U.S. K-12 market is home prices. We are encouraged by signs that U.S. housing prices may have finally bottomed, which eventually lead to a recovery in state revenue from property taxes. Through August 2012, the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, the leading measure of U.S. home prices, showed that the average home price increases for both the 10-City Composite and the 20-City Composites for the fourth consecutive month and those were rising.", "As we approach the separation of the Education company, I want to sincerely thank all of the Education employees for all of their extremely hard work and dedication.  Helping to raise educational levels around the world is not only a noble calling, it's essential.  And their hard work and dedication are to be commended. The past year, they have made very tough decisions on costs while building world-class products and services for future growth and success.  With the digital footprint that they have created and the superb new management in place under President \"Buzz\" Waterhouse, I feel truly excited about how the Education company is positioned as it becomes a standalone company.", "In summary, McGraw-Hill Financial continues to deliver solid top and bottom line growth. The separation of McGraw-Hill Education is approaching, and the business is becoming an attractive standalone company with highly talented employees, innovative and essential education products and services and an appropriate cost structure. In summation, McGraw-Hill is delivering on its Growth and Value Plan commitments, with the pending separation, exciting growth plans, multiple tuck-in acquisition, sizable cost reductions and aggressive share repurchase program.", "With that, that completes my comments on the third quarter. I will now ask Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, to update you on some of the key financial performance, and then I'd look forward to going in any direction that you would like to go. Jack?", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to discuss several topics: our consolidated results, including cash flow; the financial impact of corporate development activities on the S&P Capital IQ Indices business; the progress of the Growth and Value Plan, including the primary drivers of cost reduction; and lastly, our increased guidance and outlook for the balance of the year.", "Let me begin by discussing our results, which, as Terry mentioned, were quite different across the Financial and Education businesses. In the quarter, McGraw-Hill Financial delivered excellent growth, with a 15% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in pro forma operating profit. This resulted in a 170-basis-point improvement in the pro forma operating margins of 36%. Overall, an excellent quarter across the MHF businesses.", "On the other hand, McGraw-Hill Education revenue decreased 11% and adjusted segment operating profit decreased 15%. As Terry just discussed, the market has proven even more challenging than our original expectations. Obviously, now that the all-important third quarter is behind us, MHE will not deliver on our initial financial guidance for this year. We now expect MHE revenues to decline 7% to 8% and operating income to be $20 million to $25 million below a year ago. Taken together, total consolidated McGraw-Hill, both revenue and expenses, increased approximately 2%. This resulted in adjusted operating profit growth of 3%.", "Overall, we delivered double-digit earnings-per-share growth. However, there were substantive changes in below-the-line comparison due to the formation of the new S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture, impacting both the tax rate and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The reduction in the effective tax rate from the prior year was due primarily to the partnership structure of the joint venture with CME, combined with the modest improvement in our overall rate. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased largely due to the new joint venture, which I will elaborate on in just a moment.", "The impact of the accelerated share repurchase program was evident again this quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced shares outstanding by 90 [ph] million shares. This leveraged a 4% increase in adjusted net income to a 10% increase in adjusted diluted earnings or $1.33 per share. It should be noted that sequentially, our fully diluted shares outstanding remained unchanged at 285 million shares as stock option exercise activity largely offset share repurchases of approximately $300 million during the quarter.", "Our share repurchase program is an important and ongoing part of the Growth and Value Plan. Since the beginning of 2011 through the third quarter of 2012, the company has repurchased nearly 42 million shares at a weighted average price of $43.22. This reduced shares outstanding by approximately 14%. We anticipate spending approximately $200 million on share repurchases in the fourth quarter.", "Now I would like to provide additional detail regarding the significant business development impact to the S&P Capital IQ and S&P Dow Jones Indices to help you better understand the results. First, within S&P Capital IQ, we made several acquisitions during the year that added new capabilities. The additions of R2, QuantHouse and CME were -- and CMA were all accretive to revenue growth. However, these acquisitions and the work that we are undertaking to integrate these acquisitions are somewhat dilutive to profits. We have absorbed these costs and the related noncash amortization without any negative impact to guidance.", "Secondly, the creation of S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture has important accounting implications for the company. Since we own a majority of the joint venture, 73%, we record 100% of the revenue and expenses in the company's income statement. During the third quarter, this included $82 million in revenues from S&P Indices and $27 million from the Dow Jones Indexes. Of course, the 27% of the net income representing our partner's share is excluded from the bottom line results.", "The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest effectively removes our partner's share of the profits from our income statement. During the third quarter, our partner's share of the profits totaled $18 million. This $18 million is excluded from the company's taxes, and I will address the impact on our reported effective tax rate in more detail in just a moment.", "Taken together, these acquisitions and the formation of the joint venture had a significant impact on the segment's revenue growth. Organic growth was 3%, in part due to difficult year-on-year comparisons in the index business. The joint venture and the 3 acquisitions increased revenue growth to 13%, with approximately 75% of the incremental revenue from the joint venture and 25% from the 3 acquisitions.", "As I mentioned earlier, the joint venture has had an impact on the company's effective tax rate that merits further explanation. For tax purposes, the joint venture is treated as a partnership. The first column of this chart presents pretax income, provision for taxes and the after-tax income, which implies the reported effective tax rate of 33.7% for the third quarter. The middle column shows the partner's share of the joint venture income.  Note the company does not make a provision for taxes for the partner's income. The last column shows the tax provision for taxes in the third quarter at a 34.6% rate, about 1 point higher than the reported effective tax rate. On a year-to-date basis, we record a 35.6% provision for taxes, and the reported effective tax rate is 35%. Full year 2012 results should be generally in line with the year-to-date performance.", "Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at quarter end. Year-over-year, our free cash flow is down approximately $200 million, due largely to the onetime cash outlays related to the Growth and Value Plan expenses and the timing of quarterly cash tax payments. On a full year basis, we expect to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash flow, excluding cash outlays associated with the Growth and Value Plan.", "One additional point on our balance sheet. This month, about 1/3 of our debt is coming due. As a result, over the near term, it is likely that we will access the commercial paper market as the repayment of the $400 million of debt and the funding of our fourth quarter share repurchase program require domestic cash availability. We will reevaluate further actions related to the balance sheet once the choice of sale versus spin options for McGraw-Hill Education are clear.", "Now let me provide some additional details related to the solid progress we are making in the execution of the Growth and Value Plan. First, all separation activities are either well under way or complete. Secondly, we continue to make progress on our target of at least $100 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2012. Let me provide some color on the 4 major initiatives that drive the cost reduction program.", "The first was the McGraw-Hill Education cost structure reductions that began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and continue into this quarter. Over 10% of the Education workforce has been reduced to resize the cost structure to market demand and to support the necessary technology investments to advance McGraw-Hill Education's digital offerings. The second was the realignment of our core benefit programs, including the pension and health care plans. The benefit plans across McGraw-Hill Financial and McGraw-Hill Education need to be increasingly tailored to their respective competitive environment.", "The third was the partnering relationships to transition various accounting, information technology and human resource activities to world-class partners, including Genpact, Atos and Workday, that specialize in these operations. The transition of these activities is well under way, and the associated onetime transition costs stepped up in the third quarter. Lastly, we have targeted selected restructuring activities across McGraw-Hill Financial operations to streamline operations consistent with being a more focused operating company.", "All in all, significant progress has been made already, and we fully expect to reduce at least $100 million in costs on a run-rate basis by the end of the year. During the third quarter, we incurred $99 million of onetime Growth and Value Plan expenses, largely related to professional fees and restructuring. These onetime expenses will continue into the fourth quarter.", "In closing, 2012 is turning out to be a remarkable year for McGraw-Hill. We are exceeding EPS expectations despite a challenging year for McGraw-Hill Education and have increased our earnings per share guidance to a range of $3.35 to $3.40. McGraw-Hill Financial is delivering great performance, and we have expanded the McGraw-Hill Financial portfolio with tuck-in acquisitions and selective partnerships like CME.", "We are positioned to make a decision on sale versus spin for McGraw-Hill Education in the coming weeks, and we are focused on making the right choice for both the business and our shareholders. And through countless efforts around the world, the work is on track to separate 2 leading companies, and we have been able to accomplish all of this while delivering cost reductions of at least $100 million. Now we are focused on a solid finish to 2012 and on finalizing the separation and standup of these 2 terrific industry-leading businesses.", "Thank you for joining us today and your interest in McGraw-Hill. Now let me turn the call back over to Chip Merritt to moderate the Q&A session. Chip?", "Robert S. Merritt", "Thanks, Jack. Just a couple of instructions. [Operator Instructions] And now, operator, we'll take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from William Bird with Lazard.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. One, what is the drop-dead deadline for a decision on sale or spin of Education? And then, second, can you talk a bit about what's happening in the index business? I know the comp was really tough, but with assets under management up 40%, revenues down 7%, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what's driving that and maybe just kind of the context around some of the issues at MSCI.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Well, Bill, and look, as far as the separation process, we have been getting out an awful lot of information throughout the year as to where we are. We have literally worked tirelessly to look at all options in all of this, and we're coming to the conclusion, just like we said we would. And so literally, I think it would be inappropriate on my part to derail any element of the process at this point. But I will say that in the coming weeks, and, hopefully, sooner, we will have an announcement to make to you.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And then on the index business?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. We're so excited about this, because we wondered very hard whether or not we could actually pull this off on this one. But to put the S&P Indices, which are largely institutional indices, together with Dow Jones Indices, which are largely retail, is just a -- it's just a fabulous combination. And as we see more and more index behavior and the growth in exchange-traded funds, both in the United States and around the world, it gives us huge opportunities as a platform to expand. And I gave one example of the Brazilian component. But I can tell you the growth of S&P Dow Jones Indices is just going to be phenomenal. It's a wonderful platform, and we're going to be able to do a lot of other things to add to this platform to grow it even faster. So we're very excited about the combination, that it's under way and that the growth prospects are so high.", "John F. Callahan", "And then, Bill, the one thing I'd also add, and it's really a third quarter issue, largely for the base S&P Indices business, is the comp versus a year ago was really difficult, largely driven because of the extensive activity in exchange-traded derivatives from a year ago. I think Terry had a chart on that during his comments. And that overlap is less onerous as we get into the fourth quarter. So I think we're more -- we think that's an easier overlap for us to manage as we head into the balance of the year.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "So just to be clear, there's been a lot written just about the fee war going on in the ETF industry. I just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing on pricing.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "At this point, and I don't want to comment on MSCI, that's theirs to do, but we are not seeing that kind of pressure at this point. So from our standpoint, we're not overly concerned by that. And again, Bill, again, the quality of brands and the recognition of those trusted brands is really, really important on that one. And again, when you have markets that have a lot of uncertainty built into it, those trusted brands take on a lot more import.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "First quick question on Platts. I guess what was the acquisition contribution for the Platts line item from BENTEK's steel business? And also, just maybe a little more color there, I mean I guess it was a little tougher comp, but it seemed like the growth decelerated a bit from the 20% in the first half of the year.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "No, actually the Platts business has been strong all year, and the Kingsman acquisition, I think you're referring to, gives us strength in terms of a brand-new sector. They expanded into the agricultural markets, not only from biofuels, but also in terms of expanding in the commodity platform. But from our standpoint, Platts has exceeded its plans and is doing extremely well, and we expect that to hold up.", "John F. Callahan", "And back to the acquisition impact, so just keep in mind, the BENTEK deal closed early in 2011, and the SPD deal closed early in the third quarter of last year. So essentially, the third quarter, it's really apples to apples. So it's really -- it's year-on-year comparisons are now -- have the acquisition in it, and the only new piece is the Kingsman acquisition. But obviously, that just closed yesterday so that's more of a fourth quarter impact. I can tell you, at least within BENTEK, we're seeing double-digit growth for that enterprise, and we're quite excited about what that's adding to the portfolio.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. And then one more question, I guess, on the ratings side. Did the trial date, I guess the Abu Dhabi trial, get pushed to May? I guess that trial was initially Feb. And then just around the trial front, can you give us an update on how the Australia trial went or what the pending status there is?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Well, first of all, in terms of Abu Dhabi, we're actually quite pleased with the situation as it's unfolding. We have eliminated several components, and it's scheduled for trial in May of next year, and we'll see how that goes. But we're not concerned at all. As far as the Australian CPDO situation, we're waiting to hear the result on that. And from our standpoint, again, we feel very -- we feel like we're in a very good position. But we should get a result any day on that, and we'll be reporting that as others will as well. But again, the overall legal situation, Manav, has been one of you've got so much wait in these things. As you know, in the United States, we do everything at the federal court level. And literally, because of all the litigation out there, not just ours, I mean, all of the litigation out there, it takes 2, 2.5 years to get before a federal judge, and so you have to wait. And one of the things that we have said, and we're encouraged by the results, is that in many cases, once it gets before a judge, it's the same day that these cases get dismissed on all that. So we are -- we think that we're in a very good position. We're obviously well advised, and it's a wait-and-see game. But to date, with the 30 cases that have been dismissed, the number of cases that have been reaffirmed to be dismissed at the higher-court level over a lower-court decision, all of those kinds of things, you have to be focused on all of these kinds of things. But we think the risk here in terms of legal aspects are low.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "This is George Tong for Peter Appert. Cost growth continued to slow in the Commodities & Commercial segment in the third quarter, which helped you generate some pretty good margins. Should that pattern replay, you think, in the fourth quarter and heading into 2013?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, George, again, I don't want to speculate here and other thing. But I have to tell you that given the strength of the digital offering and the subscription growth, our hope is that continued emphasis on the cost reduction part is doable. But I would just say at this point that we're very pleased with the results for year-to-date and for the third quarter, and you have my assurances that every focus is on continuing to find ways to reduce those costs. But we're very excited about the revenue growth here. It's a good picture, and it's getting better.", "John F. Callahan", "As you saw last quarter, we had some pretty good margins in the segment, and I think we'll be around sort of this high-20s -- mid- to high-20s range sort of going forward, nice margins in Platts. And we have, as Terry mentioned, a great year for J.D. Power and a stabilizing across the balance of the Commercial platform. So we should be in this range for the fourth quarter.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "And by the way, George, having just come back from Beijing on a quick trip, J.D. Power's business ought to do really well. I've never seen so many cars in my entire life and traffic jams to go with them.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's very helpful. Could you give us some -- sort of switching gears a bit. Could you give us some additional detail on your outlook for the Education business and when you might expect an inflection point in spending and budgets to occur?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Wow. I wish I could do so with some accuracy here. Look, the Education business, whether we're talking Higher Ed, whether we're talking Professional, International or the all-important K-12, these are essential businesses. I mean, you're talking about educating your future workforce. And the unfortunate part, we have seen in the United States a significant deterioration in educational funding, which has very dire consequences for student achievement and all of those kind of thing. We've got to get back onto that track. Now if your -- if everything is essentially based on property tax structures at local and state municipalities and all that, and you put the longest housing recession that we've ever seen together with that, you've got a very bad combination, plus the fact that you have so many states that are in deficit and all of those thing.  Those aren't excuses. Those are realities and everything. So one, on improving housing market, getting states out of deficit positions and getting growth again is going to help this situation. But literally -- and this won't last.  I mean, it can't.  But this is the worst K-12 environment in a decade. And I think it should be, obviously, an outrage to everyone, but it won't last. And second part is, coupled with that environment, the positive here is the speed of the digital transformation part. We are seeing increased activity across the board here. We have been -- whether we're working with certain manufacturer -- device manufacturers or whether we're working with partners in terms of developing digital solution, we've been working aggressively on this for some time, and the receptivity of it is just moving at a very fast pace now. And so that's very encouraging. That's got serious implications for cost reduction, but also, very, very strong positives for our revenue growth on that part. But it's an essential business, it's our future workforce, and the Education agenda should be a priority for any country.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.", "Craig Huber", "Just a few questions. Terry, first, on the cost-cutting front, you talked of this $100 million annualized goal you're looking to get by end of this year. Can you -- I'm just curious. Why is that number at the end of the day not going to potentially be 2x to 3x that? I ask that in the context, last year, as you know, you had -- I think you had $4.8 billion costs to your company. Why only $100 million, my first question, please?", "John F. Callahan", "This is a Jack. Craig, look, what's unique about this situation is we're talking about cost reduction in the context of separation. I think there's very few companies that have ever talked about both of those things at the same time, and we're trying to put an end date on this cost program, because once we get into the early part of next year, these are 2 separate entities. Then it'll be my accountability to come back and talk what would the cost outlook is for McGraw-Hill Financial, and it'll be Patrick Milano's to do the same for McGraw-Hill Education. And I think it's, kind of given the separation right ahead of us now, it's premature to kind of go past that. But we certainly acknowledge that there's opportunity here, and I think some of the foundational things we have done this year give us opportunities to kind of extend some of the cost programs once we move into 2 separate entities.  So more to come.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "And Craig, I'd just echo that. Again, the most important thing in terms of separation is making sure that we've got the right options and we're on track and on target and all of those kind of thing. At the same time, as you start to decouple the shared services and all the other kind of capabilities to that, there's lots of opportunities here in all that. But I think to do, as Jack said, the separation correctly and to put out a $100 million number is very responsible. But we think that there's a lot more opportunity, and we look forward to, once the separation is completed, coming back with you with another number.", "Craig Huber", "Okay. And my second question, please, if you think about the backlogs in your Ratings business for the next 2 to 3 months, what are they looking like right now, and how much risk do you think there is just given the federal debt ceiling has to get raised? We know how that went 1.5 years ago, terrible. Secondly, also with the fiscal cliff issue for January 1 [ph] is that going to put issuers on hold here for a while? What do you think there, please?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Well, look.  First of all, and not to talk about just the fourth quarter, to talk about the next 3, 5, 10 years, the capital demand needs are huge. And if you talk about infrastructure financing alone, between now and 2030, you're talking some $70 trillion. You're talking about $1 trillion of infrastructure financing in India alone over the next 5 years. The study that I gave you was on just refunding between now and 2016 of $8 trillion. So the demand here is absolutely huge on that part. So I'm not -- I mean, any given time, you're going to have some slowness or some pickup or whatever, but the overall demand for capital is only going to go up, and banks are not going to be able to satisfy all that kind of demand. And in fact, the reason that the capital markets and fixed income markets in particular are doing so well is because now the banks, in many ways, are stalled and the largest portion of the capital demand has got to come from the capital markets on that one. So from a backlog standpoint, we're doing really well. Now the second part to that question is, look, obviously, the European Central Bank made a decision that they were going to intervene in the sovereign bond market and provide a level of support. That, obviously, created some activity. When Ben Bernanke came out with the QE3, the real question was, \"Is there going to be a QE4?\" and anything.  I don't know and all of that, but both of those caused global spreads to contract and, obviously, fueled a surge in September bond issuance. So then I get questions like, \"Okay, well, is that just bringing moneys forward that were in the fourth quarter or the first quarter for next year or something like that?\" How do I know and all of that, and we'll just have to wait and see what the facts are. But the capital demand load is huge on that one and it's worldwide on that part. And again, with 45% of our revenues coming from outside the United States, we're in a terrific position to be able to deal with that.", "Craig Huber", "And also, Terry, if I could ask, once you sell or spin off your Education, if you do actually sell it, would you use those proceeds most likely to buy back stock? Of course, a small piece of the refinancing you talked about, given your [ph] style to do large acquisitions, of course.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. Well, first of all, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, here. But let me give you 2 facts on that one that Jack was talking about. One, we are an extremely dividend-friendly company, and we have been since we created a dividend in 1936 and have been increasing it every year since '74. And so there's going to be no letup on that side. Number two, in terms of share repurchase, I think our track record is out there, and it's pretty solid. We're a very share-repurchase-friendly company. And we do anticipate we're back in the market in the third quarter. We bought back $295 million. We did the accelerated share repurchase of $1.5 billion last year, and I expect to have a strong share repurchase program going forward. But I think it's a little premature to talk about what level or all of those kind of things. But from a financial engineering standpoint, I think our track record is pretty solid.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Reynolds with Jefferies.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "David Reynolds here from London. Just to say it's great to see New York is back on track, and our thoughts are with you. A question, though, just -- and I don't mean to labor the point, but if I can just address the coming decision process around the Education asset, and clearly, you've talked about it being on a timescale of the coming weeks. Are you able to describe what kind of decision you are now going through? Is it one of having received the bids, you're determining whether a price is acceptable? I know it's a difficult area to talk about, but if you could shed some light on that, that would be helpful", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thanks, David, and thanks for your comments about New York . I mean, as you know, from your own associates, I mean, it has really been hard hit, and it's probably going to be weeks in terms of getting total business continuity going again and all of that. But thanks for the comments on that. Now as far as the separation process and all that, look, we said from the very beginning that we're going to look at every single aspect in all of this, and that's exactly what we've done. We've given out timelines, and we are coming to a conclusion. And again, I think to skew this in any way is not appropriate from my standpoint at this point. So the best color I can give you is that you're not talking a long time frame here. You're talking, literally, coming weeks and maybe sooner.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "That's great. And perhaps just one follow-up, obviously, we noted your increase in the full year '12 guidance. Intuitively, that feels relatively conservative. Would you agree with that?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "David, you're a great guy. Look, I thought the range $3.25 to $3.35 was a really, really solid number and range for us for 2012. The facts that things were a little bit better, that our cost reduction programs came in, all of those kinds of things, we started in the midyear giving guidance that it was more like $3.30 and maybe closer as we got on towards the upper end of the range. But given the third quarter and all of that and the way we expect to finish 2012, we think that improving the guidance from $3.35 to $3.40 is a good step. I mean, it's really there. Now would I like to be able to give more -- I'll get into a wrestling match with Jack here in a minute and all of that. But we're pleased with that guidance, and if things go the way we like it, we'll be very pleased.", "John F. Callahan", "We're pretty focused on delivering on the commitments that we make. But -- and then we're hopeful that we'll finish the year nicely to position us well for next year.", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from Bill Warmington with Raymond James.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A question for you on how many cases are still outstanding for Standard & Poor's? And then, finally, when do you start to bump up against some of the statute of limitations for these claims?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Let's see. In terms of the outstanding issue, it's -- I'd have to get the exact number for you, but it's a few dozen. If you call Chip, he can get the exact number for you, but it's way down, obviously. But since the downturn in the markets and all of those kind of thing, it's been a solid 4-plus years in all of that. So the expectations that we had in terms of there's no merit to some of these and all of that has borne out to be true and all of that. But we've got a few dozen left.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then for the EPS guidance for 2012, does that include the impact of the $200 million of share repurchases you're planning to do in the fourth quarter?", "John F. Callahan", "It's a consideration. But by the time we average those in, it's not going to have a big impact. As you saw in the third quarter, it's hard to predict what's going to happen with stock option exercises. So I wouldn't view our guidance as dependent on it at this point in time, but it's probably -- it'll have a bigger impact as we get into next year.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "And again, based on market conditions and all of those kind of things, we'll keep everybody updated on exactly what we're doing.", "John F. Callahan", "One other point in your first question on the legal situation is I can tell you sort of our legal expense on a run-rate basis is coming down a bit. So I think we're -- so I think if that's any indicator of some of the issues facing the company, that is one thing we are looking at.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Excellent. And then if you could comment on the competitive environment for Capital IQ, especially in light of Bloomberg putting through a 6% price increase. That would seem like it would be a positive for you.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, again, I don't want to talk about any of the other competitors. That's for them. We feel very, very good about where Capital IQ is. We talked about the addition of 4,400 clients and 55,000 subscribers and all of that. Our growth plan for Capital IQ is on target. And I think the other thing to focus in on at Capital IQ is the customization aspect of this, that we can -- we have multiple abilities to put more content packages together to create customized platforms for customers, and that's what we're focused on doing. But Capital IQ is on target.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenters' slides is available now for downloading from www.mcgraw-hill.com.

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] To access the webcast and slides, go to www.mcgraw-hill.com and click on the link for the fourth quarter earnings webcast. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us this morning for McGraw-Hill Companies' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued a news release with our results. I should comment, there was a bit of a confusion with those -- with some of the press reports coming out of that. I want to remind all the listeners that the McGraw-Hill Education business was reclassified as a discontinued operation. What that means is you're not going to see McGraw-Hill Education revenue in the revenue line. You see that the ultimate results, if you will, the profitability of McGraw-Hill Education, in one line, entitled discontinued operations. So hopefully, the media can straighten that out.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results also reflect the reclassification of McGraw-Hill Education as a discontinued operation, as I mentioned a moment ago.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in those forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 512-3151 subsequent to this call.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. Terry?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being with us, and welcome to today's conference call. While we're excited about sharing our Growth and Value Plan accomplishments and the strong financial results delivered both in the fourth quarter and in the full year, we recognize that investors are keenly interested in receiving a thorough update concerning recent legal development. Therefore, the normal sections that Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, and I cover have been somewhat abbreviated.", "So in addition to Jack Callahan joining me on today's call, you will also hear presentations from Ken Vittor, our General Counsel; and Doug Peterson, the President of Standard & Poor's Ratings. Ken will discuss the civil complaint we received last week from the Department of Justice and demonstrate that this and other state claims are entirely without factual or legal merit, and we will vigorously defend our company as we have successfully defended against more than 40 other financial crisis-related cases. Doug Peterson will then discuss the ongoing changes that we have made and will continue to make to ensure the highest quality ratings. And at the end of the call, I will make a few summary remarks and then open it up for questions.", "So let's begin. In September of 2011, we introduced our Growth and Value Plan. Today, we are pleased to discuss the many achievements of this plan. There were 4 principal components of the Growth and Value Plan. First, I told you that we would transform McGraw-Hill from a holding company into 2 focused industry-leading stand-alone operating companies: McGraw-Hill Financial, focused on global capital and commodity and commercial market; and McGraw-Hill Education, focused on educational services and digital learning.", "For McGraw-Hill Education, we found a more attractive path forward for our shareowners in the form of a sale to Apollo Global Management for $2.5 billion. All of the government approvals have been received and Apollo is securing their financing, and we expect the deal to close in the first quarter.", "Second, we discussed stepping up our focus on reducing costs and committed to reducing a run rate cost by at least $100 million. Today, we're proud to announce that we have achieved $175 million in yearly savings. The principal components of the savings come from redesigning the employee benefits plans, including a freeze of the U.S. benefit plan; select headcount restructurings of approximately 670 employees within McGraw-Hill Financial and approximately 10% of the McGraw-Hill Education workforce; and the migration of numerous accounting, IT and human resource work streams to world-class partners. While McGraw-Hill Financial will end up with some stranded costs, we estimate that approximately 1/3 of the savings will be realized by McGraw-Hill Financial after taking into account these additional stranded costs.", "Third, we committed to accelerating the pace of capital return to shareholders. Here, again, we delivered on our commitment. During 2011 and 2012, we spent $1.8 billion and repurchased 41.5 million shares. And importantly, we plan to continue our share repurchase activity in 2013, and Jack Callahan will discuss that in just a moment. We also returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Along with our normal quarterly dividend, we distributed a special dividend of $2.50 per share in December of 2012 or approximately $700 million. Most recently, we increased our regular quarterly dividend by about 10%.", "And lastly, we committed to investing for growth. Earlier this year, we formed the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture. With some of the most widely followed and trusted brands in the index space, we believe this joint venture will prove to be of great value not only to our customers, but also to our shareholders.", "In addition, during 2012, the company acquired QuantHouse, R2 Financial Technologies and Credit Market Analysis Limited to bolster our capabilities within S&P Capital IQ. We acquired Coalition Development Ltd. to add high-end analytics to CRISIL, that's our credit rating agency in India; and Kingsman SA, providing Platts with a springboard for growth into global agricultural commodity markets.", "Okay. Now turning to the business results. McGraw-Hill Financial delivered for the full year in 2012 13% revenue growth, 24% adjusted operating profit and 32% adjusted earnings per share growth. Our operating leverage and share repurchases amplified the EPS.", "Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ended an already solid year with a strong fourth quarter. Revenue for this segment grew 34% with a 46% increase in domestic revenue and a 23% increase in international revenue. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 63% and corresponding operating margin increased 750 basis points to more than 43%. Continued low interest rates, the tightest spreads of the year, concerns about the fiscal cliff and a surge in special dividends all contributed to a very strong quarter of debt issuance.", "For the full year 2012, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services delivered double-digit growth for both revenue and adjusted operating profit. This was the second best worldwide corporate and government issuance year on record at $4.5 trillion and U.S. structured issuance increased more than 50%.", "This chart shows a steady progression of increased issuance in the United States and, while a bit more erratic, a similar trend in Europe. The sequential fourth quarter increase in U.S. issuance was predominantly due to low treasury yields, low spreads, ample liquidity and an abundance of dividend recapitalization deals.", "Let me turn over to S&P Capital IQ. Beginning this quarter, S&P Capital IQ -- and beginning this quarter, S&P Capital IQ and S&P Dow Jones Indices will reported -- be reported as separate lines of businesses and we're going to do this to give investors added transparency into the growth and value creation for both businesses.", "So let me start with the S&P Dow Jones Indices. In the fourth quarter, organic revenue increased 5% and the addition of Dow Jones Index revenue brought total revenue to $110 million. The principal driver of the organic revenue growth was a 28% increase in assets under management and exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices to $402 billion. Including the assets under management linked to Dow Jones Indices, assets under management increased 27% to $466 billion. Partly offsetting this growth was a decline in average daily volumes from major exchange-traded derivatives and over-the-counter derivative activity of almost 20%. While the joint venture realized $67 million of adjusted operating profit, $50 million is retained by the company as 25 -- 27% of the profits are forwarded to our partners.", "You can see the full year figures on this slide as well. We are encouraged by the prospects for 2013. Through November, investors pulled $119 billion from actively managed U.S. stock funds in 2012, the biggest yearly outflow since 2008, and that's according to the latest data from Morningstar. Industry exchange-traded fund inflows reached a record $191 billion in 2012, and of course that's surpassing $169 billion flow in 2008. We believe this strong trend of increased index investing will continue.", "For Capital IQ, in the fourth quarter, S&P Capital IQ delivered top line growth of 8%, of which 5% was organic.", "Two key offerings, S&P Capital IQ within Desktop Solutions and Global Data Solutions within Enterprise Solutions, delivered double-digit revenue growth. These results were offset somewhat by declines in revenue from equity research and the continued planned migration away from the TheMarkets.com. Both S&P Capital IQ and RatingsXpress delivered mid- to high-single digit subscriber growth. RatingsXpress is now available on express feed. This will enable customers to receive updates every 15 minutes instead of only once or twice during the day.", "Adjusted operating profit decreased 1% and there was a modest decline in the adjusted operating margins as the segment integrates and develops newly acquired technology and products from R2, QuantHouse and CMA into new S&P Capital IQ offerings.", "For the full year, S&P Capital IQ revenue increased 9%, of which 7% was organic, and adjusted operating profit increased 6%. Through the first 6 months of the year, adjusted operating profit increased 19%. But due to the acquisitions and the associated investment, profitability declined in the second half.", "We have made great progress developing these new technologies. By the end of the first quarter, we expect QuantLINK to be able to deliver low latency data from every major exchange in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition, we anticipate rolling out our new portfolio of risk analytics product and that would be in the second quarter.", "Let me shift now to the Commodities & Commercial market segment. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 9% with international revenue up 21%. The leverage of this business is very evident as adjusted operating profits increased 27% and the margin increased 300 basis points to 22.7%. Platts, J.D. Power and Aviation Week drove fourth quarter revenue growth and offset declines in McGraw-Hill Construction. Margins, while up year-over-year, were down sequentially due to the Kingsman acquisition and technology investments in new products and capabilities.", "For the full year, Commodities & Commercial grew 9% and adjusted operating profit grew 40%. Both Platts and J.D. Power delivered record revenue. And with the explosive growth that Platts has provided and the investor attention that it's received this year, I don't think I can continue to call it our hidden gem.", "Okay, let's hold it there, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, for additional detail on the financials, and he will also be going into the outlook for 2013. Jack?", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to discuss 3 topics. First, now that Education has moved to discontinued operations, I want to baseline our McGraw-Hill Financial results, including cash flow and our strong balance sheet position, which now form the starting point for future performance. Second, I will detail the onetime charges that were essential to separate and stand up the 2 companies. This will help investors better evaluate the underlying performance of McGraw-Hill Financial. And lastly, I will provide our guidance and outlook for 2013 across our 4 lines of business and for other selected financial items that are foundational to the future performance of McGraw-Hill Financial.", "Let me begin by comparing our previously consolidated McGraw-Hill Companies results, which includes McGraw-Hill Education, to our new continuing business, McGraw-Hill Financial. As you can see from the slide, McGraw-Hill Financial has achieved a 2010 to 2012 revenue CAGR of 11%, almost 3x higher growth compared to The McGraw-Hill Companies. This growth is based largely on capital and commodity market participants who value the benchmarks, analytics and independent insights that McGraw-Hill Financial provides. Reflecting the stronger revenue growth, McGraw-Hill Financial has delivered 2010-2012 adjusted earnings per share CAGR of 20%, a growth rate over 50% higher when compared to our historical performance pre-separation.", "It has taken a tremendous effort across the organization to establish 2 separate industry-leading companies.", "Now we turn our focus across McGraw-Hill Financial to provide market participants with valuable and essential services and to target more pronounced growth for both our shareholders and employees.", "Let me review full year results. McGraw-Hill Financial revenue grew 13% to $4.45 billion and adjusted segment operating profit growth grew 21%, with margins increasing 230 basis points to 35.7%. The margin expansion was driven by the benefits realized from our cost reduction initiatives and positive sales mix. Adjusted unallocated expense grew 2% as an increase in incentives offset tight cost management. These unallocated expenses include approximately $20 million to $25 million of stranded costs due to the divestiture of McGraw-Hill Education.", "The tax rate declined 130 basis points while noncontrolling interests grew $33 million, both primarily due to the impact of the S&P Dow Jones joint venture.", "For the year, adjusted net income from continuing operations grew 24%, while adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations grew even faster with 32% growth to $2.75.", "Share count dropped from 304 million shares to 285 million shares due to our share repurchase program.", "Overall, 2012 was a strong base year for McGraw-Hill Financial and one on which we plan to build for 2013.", "Now I will discuss the more recent fourth quarter results. McGraw-Hill Financial delivered excellent growth, well ahead of full year results with a 22% increase in revenue and a 45% increase in adjusted segment operating profit. As Terry mentioned, Standard & Poor's Ratings led the growth, benefiting from the strong debt issuance trends, especially when compared to the modest market activity of a year ago.", "Adjusted unallocated expense grew 7%, primarily due to increased incentive compensation due to the strong overall operating results.", "Our tax rate declined 150 basis points versus prior year primarily due to the impact of the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture. Offsetting this decline was a $17 million increase in noncontrolling interests, again largely representing CME's share of the joint venture profits.", "Adjusted net income grew 52% while adjusted earnings per share grew 56% to $0.72. Overall, a solid finish to a strong year.", "Now let me just take a moment to run through the onetime charges, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. McGraw-Hill Financial incurred a net $25 million in onetime charges in the fourth quarter and $174 million for the full year. Excluding the $52 million noncash benefit from a change in vacation policy, the onetime costs were $77 million in the fourth quarter and $226 million for the full year. Going forward, Growth and Value Plan costs and related restructuring actions are anticipated to ramp down over the first half of 2013.", "With regard to discontinued operations, McGraw-Hill Education incurred onetime cash charges of $61 million and a $497 million intangible impairment at School Education, which we indicated we would incur in November of 2012 when we announced we had signed an agreement to sell McGraw-Hill Education to Apollo. There was also a benefit from the company-wide change in vacation policy in the discontinued operations.", "Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Free cash flow, before the payment of the regular dividend, was $626 million in 2012. The decline of $183 million versus last year was entirely driven by the Growth and Value Plan expenses and a $150 million pension contribution made in the fourth quarter of 2012. We finished the year with $761 million in cash and short-term investments and over $1.2 billion in debt, $800 million long term and $457 million short term. The short-term debt consists of commercial paper, which will be paid down with the proceeds from McGraw-Hill Education.", "Overall, we have an exceptionally strong balance sheet, and we intend to maintain it going forward to both build the business, and as appropriate, return cash to shareholders.", "Now let me turn to 2013 guidance. As a reminder, our guidance is based on 2012 adjusted results from continuing operations. First, the lines of business. We expect S&P Ratings to grow high single digits, both top and bottom line, reflecting the continued favorable issuance environment. Given the strong finish this year, we obviously expect the comparisons to 2012 will become more challenging in the second half of 2013.", "For S&P Capital IQ, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth, but relatively flat profits given continued investments. We do anticipate profit growth in the back half of the year as the first half of the year is likely to be below year ago as we cycle through acquisitions, particularly QuantHouse, and targeted technology investments.", "For S&P Dow Jones Indices, we expect approximately 20% top and bottom line growth, benefiting from the full-year benefit of the joint venture. We expect organic growth to be in the mid-single digits, although results are always a bit of a challenge to predict given the ongoing volatility in the market.", "For Commodities & Commercial, we expect high-single-digit revenue growth with continued margin expansion targeting low-double-digit profit growth.", "Taken in total, we expect high-single-digit revenue and segment operating profit growth for McGraw-Hill Financial.", "Let me provide additional detail on selected financial items. Unallocated expense, which was $202 million in 2012, should decline by $10 million to $15 million in 2013 although this line can be impacted by swings in incentive compensation. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $35 million to $40 million versus $81 million in 2012. This decline reflects the paydown of $400 million and 5 3/8% senior notes in November of 2012 and the anticipated paydown of our existing short-term debt once the funds from the sale of McGraw-Hill Education are received. We will also earn interest on the $250 million of the 8.5% senior unsecured notes, which will be received as part of the sale of McGraw-Hill Education to Apollo.", "We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 35% in 2013, 100 basis points decline from 2012, reflecting a full year's benefit of the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture and other ongoing tax planning initiatives. We expect noncontrolling interests to be $90 million to $100 million versus $52 million in 2012, largely due to the full-year impact of the joint venture. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $125 million, and free cash flow should continue to be strong and is expected to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million before the payment of the basic dividend.", "Summing up. We expect another strong year in 2013 with revenue growth in the high-single digits and earnings per share of $3.10 to $3.20, approximately 15% growth. Please note, our guidance does include the impact of continued share repurchase. Once we receive the proceeds from the sale of Education, we anticipate resuming our share repurchase program subject to market conditions. As a reminder, 16.9 million shares remain in our current share repurchase authorization.", "Now let me turn the call back over to Terry.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thanks, Jack. And as you heard from Jack's review, 2012 was just a terrific year for McGraw-Hill Financial. We continue to generate substantial amounts of cash, and our 2013 guidance paints a picture of continued growth.", "Okay, with that, let me now ask Ken Vittor, he's McGraw-Hill's General Counsel, to address the recent legal developments and how we plan to defend our company against the civil complaint that we just received last week from the Department of Justice. Ken?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Thank you, Terry. I want to describe the legal actions that were brought last week by the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice, as well as the number of cases filed just after the DOJ announcement by State Attorneys General. As Terry said at the beginning of the call, the company does not believe the cases have legal or factual merit, and we intend to defend the company vigorously as we have successfully defended against more than 40 other financial crisis-related cases.", "Last Monday, February 4, the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit against The McGraw-Hill Companies and Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC in federal court in California. No other companies are named as defendants in the case nor are there any individuals who have been named as defendants. The case was brought under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, known as the FIRREA statute. This is a federal statute that permits the Department of Justice to seek civil penalties if it can establish that violations occurred of a number of other statutes and that the violations affected a federally insured financial institution.", "In this case, the government is alleging that violations of the mail fraud, wire fraud and bank fraud statutes occurred and that they affected financial institutions, including Western Corporate Federal Credit Union, known as WesCorp; Citibank; and Bank of America. The government alleges that the company violated these statutes when it issued its forward-looking rating opinions concerning creditworthiness or confirmed those opinions of 33 collateralized debt obligations, known as CDOs, in 2007. The government claims that in preparing its ratings, S&P knowingly failed fully to take into account risks associated with residential mortgage-backed securities, known as RMBS, that were being used as collateral for the CDOs.", "The government also claims in its lawsuit that S&P statements about its independence and objectivity were false because during the years 2004 to 2007, S&P allegedly made adjustments or delayed adjustments to the models it used to rate RMBS and CDOs in order to preserve market share at the expense of analytical accuracy. The government says that it is seeking more than $5 billion in penalties. This figure is based on losses that were allegedly suffered by federally insured financial institutions that purchased CDOs rated by S&P in 2007. The complaint includes specifics regarding only about $500 million of the $5 billion the government is seeking. The government has not explained where the other $4.5 billion in alleged losses come from.", "The revenues S&P earned in connection with the CDOs identified in the complaint were less than $15 million. About half of the par value of the CDOs identified in the complaint relates to losses that allegedly affected Citibank and Bank of America after purchasing CDOs that they, or their affiliates, had underwritten or arranged. The penalties that the government is seeking in this case are based on its position that they are not required to show that the losses were proximately caused by S&P's rating opinions.", "The government cannot recover any penalty, of course, unless it first proves that a violation of one of the statutes occurred. S&P believes that to do this, the government is required to prove that S&P rating committee did not believe the ratings that S&P gave to the CDOs at the time these rating opinions were issued; that S&P assigned those ratings with the intent to defraud the investors, which purchased those CDOs; and that S&P's rating opinions affected a federally insured financial institution.", "As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the company intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously. We believe that the complete record does not support the government's theory. S&P did not make changes to its model that it believed were not analytically justified nor could S&P refuse to make changes that had been determined to be analytically justified by a committee. The culture at S&P has always been characterized by vigorous debate and robust analysis. Although there may have been opinions within the company, even very strongly held opinions, that did not carry the day, this is not evidence of fraud.", "The government's claim that S&P did not fully take into account the risk of RMBS that were going into CDOs in 2007 is also, we believe, a hindsight criticism of S&P's rating opinions during this turbulent time, which we don't think can support a fraud claim. The complaint details information about deteriorating residential mortgages that S&P had available to it in February, March, April, May, June and July of 2007. This data, by the way, about the rate at which residential mortgages were becoming delinquent, is the same data that was available to the rest of the market and to the government. It is the same data that the Federal Open Market Committee was reviewing during 2007 in the transcripts that were made public a few weeks ago.", "What the complaint leaves out is all of the work being done by S&P in each of those months to understand that data and to make good-faith judgments about what it might mean for the security that S&P rated. In fact, S&P reviewed this data every month and developed more stressful tests to help it update its opinion of any RMBS that was exposed to these delinquent mortgages. As a result, S&P took an increasing number of negative rating actions, CreditWatch actions and downgrades in February, March, April, May, June and July 2007, even before its large-scale rating actions in mid-July. These negative rating actions had a direct and automatic impact on S&P's CDO ratings. If the RMBS that was put on CreditWatch were downgraded within a CDO or was being considered for a new CDO, S&P's CDO rating took that negative status into account and required additional protection for the CDO.", "Unfortunately, these actions turned out to be insufficient in anticipating the great speed, depth and duration of the housing crisis that ultimately came to pass. But the company does not believe the government can prove that this failure, common to nearly everyone at the time, was the product of intentional misconduct by anyone at S&P.", "Significantly, the government's complaint also ignores the fact that all of the CDOs that it identifies received a virtually identical rating from at least one other rating agency.", "The company has publicly responded to the government complaint in 2 press releases last week. These press releases and additional information about the government's case is also available on S&P's website.", "Following the announcement of the DOJ lawsuit, 13 additional states and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits against McGraw-Hill and S&P. These losses generally follow the pattern of the lawsuits that were already pending in Connecticut, Illinois and Mississippi, although there are some differences among them. One state, California, is suing for losses incurred by 2 state pension funds under a statute, the California False Claims Act, that potentially allows for treble damages. The lawsuits in Connecticut and Mississippi were brought against both S&P and Moody's. It is possible that additional states will file similar lawsuits.", "Generally speaking, these cases are being brought under each state's consumer protection law and focus on S&P's statements regarding the independence and objectivity of its ratings practices.", "The company has been vigorously defending these lawsuits. It is the company's position that its statements about objectivity and independence cannot be the basis for a claim of deception.", "The company has recently received a very favorable ruling on this issue from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently dismissed a civil lawsuit brought by the Ohio Attorney General against S&P, Moody's and Fitch arising from its pension fund's purchase of RMBS rated by the 3 rating agencies. In short, we believe that we have strong defenses in the DOJ and the state lawsuits and expect to prevail.", "Now let me turn the call back to Terry.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay, thanks, Ken, and we can follow up on that. At this point, though, I'm going to turn it over to Doug Peterson. Doug is the President of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, and Doug is going to provide a review of the action S&P has taken to strengthen the ratings process since the financial crisis began in 2007, which is an ongoing and continuous process as markets change. So, Doug?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Thank you, Terry. I appreciate the opportunity to be here this morning. It's been nearly 18 months since I joined Standard & Poor's as President. This follows a 25-year career with Citibank where I most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of Citibank N.A. Over my career at Citi, I worked with S&P in various ways and was impressed by the rigor, knowledge and professionalism of S&P analysts. Since joining S&P, I have developed an even greater appreciation of the tremendous talent we have in our organization. Obviously, we are facing a significant legal challenge, but I'm confident that this team of professionals will not let it distract them from the task at hand. They are an extremely committed group who care about the quality of the ratings they provide and are continually focused on how they can do their jobs even better.", "Today, I'd like to talk with you about both the past and the future. It's important for you to know the many changes that have taken place at S&P and what's in store going forward. To begin, let me say that we have taken to heart the lessons learned from the financial crisis and made extensive changes that reinforce the integrity, independence and performance of our ratings. We brought in new leadership, instituted new governance and enhanced our risk management.", "Long before the financial crisis, we had in place policies and procedures to manage potential conflicts of interest, including a separation of analytical and commercial activities and a ban on analysts from participating in fee negotiations. An analyst's compensation has never been based on the volume of securities they rate or the type of ratings they give out.", "Since 2008, we have taken many steps to enhance our ability to provide independent, high-quality ratings. They can be summarized under 4 headings. First, we reinforced our analytical independence by rotating analysts assigned to a particular issuer and by enhancing analyst training on issuer interactions.", "Second, we updated our methodologies and models. We reassessed the principles underlying the way we rate debt. Based on what we learned, we changed the way we rate almost every type of security that was affected by the financial crisis. For all mortgage-related securities, we significantly increased the credit enhancement required to achieve a AAA rating and, in general, have made it more difficult for securities to achieve high ratings. We also strengthened our risk management by instituting a model validation process independent of any commercial considerations, and we brought in a new Chief Risk Officer.", "Third, we enhanced our global connectivity on interpreting and responding to credit conditions. Specifically, we established what we call Credit Conditions Committees around the world to identify and monitor risks to the interconnected global credit systems across all asset classes.", "Lastly, we bolstered our governance, compliance and risk functions. We strengthened our governance structure to meet the requirements of the newly instituted regulatory regimes in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world. In doing so, we increased staffing across all independent control functions. All told, S&P invested approximately $400 million in the systems, governance, analytics and the methodologies we used to rate securities.", "One topic that we have given a great deal of thought to is our business model, in which the issuer pays for the rating. Along with many others, we have studied the different model options. We believe the issuer pay model is not just best for our business, but also best for the market. It is the only business model that provides a level playing field in terms of disclosure, and transparency is critical to well-functioning markets. Anyone can go to our website and see how we rate a company, country or security free of charge. That's not the case with the subscriber model, which allows only those who pay to see a rating and promote selective disclosure.", "We have learned many valuable lessons from the regrettable fact that we did not anticipate the 34% collapse in U.S. housing prices, and we continue to find ways to improve our ratings and our business. Toward that end, 3 months after I joined S&P, we created a new organizational structure to enable us to better focus on 3 priorities to drive growth and consistency around the globe.", "The first is ratings excellence. We strive to differentiate S&P by being the premier source of global benchmarks and research that help our customers identify, measure and manage credit risk. The second is service excellence. We're sharpening our focus on investors and other market participants by enhancing the way we serve and respond to them. And lastly, we're delivering with discipline. We're executing with operational excellence through the efficient use of our resources and an even stronger commitment to quality, control and compliance.", "To support these 3 priorities, we realigned several areas and brought in a new leadership to strengthen the management team. These include Don Howard, who joined us last June as S&P's Chief Risk Officer, a newly created role. Don brings years of experience of management in a variety of financial institutions around the globe.", "To improve our thought leadership in macroeconomic forecasting, we welcomed Paul Sheard as S&P's Chief Global Economist. Paul is an internationally known economist, thinker and author.", "To strengthen the management oversight of our analytical units, we appointed Paul Coughlin as Head of Global Analytics to ensure that we have common policies, processes and platforms around the world. In addition, Paul assumed worldwide responsibility for our structured finance business.", "As we look forward, we see an even greater role for independent rating agencies to sustain global economic growth. Banks are deleveraging and rebuilding their balance sheets while also complying with new regulatory requirements. That means the debt capital markets are going to have to provide more of the funding for public and private sector growth. Emerging market countries are developing credit cultures in order to finance schools, roads, energy and hospitals where our ratings facilitate access to more investors, and the outlook for both new issuance and refinancing is positive. Overall, these are favorable trends for the global economy and for our business.", "Standard & Poor's has a long history of serving markets and investors. We trace our origins back to 1860 when Henry Varnum Poor published a book called The History of Railroads and Canals in the United States. His goal was to help investors better understand the securities they were buying. While we always have to work through challenges, we see excellent opportunities in our business by continuing to serve markets and investors. We look forward to discussing these opportunities with you in the days ahead.", "And with that, I will pass it back to Terry.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. Thanks, Doug. And, Doug, in your last point, in talking about some of the infrastructure, between now and 2030, we're going to have to raise, worldwide, some-$70 trillion in infrastructure financing, which is largely going to be coming from the capital markets and bringing a lot of enhancements. So it's very exciting on that part.", "Okay. Before we go to questions, let me just make a few summary remarks. First, McGraw-Hill Financial had a very strong year: 13% revenue growth, 32% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Second, our new guidance demonstrates our expectation for continued growth in 2013. And third, we delivered tremendous value through the execution of the Growth and Value Plan, which included the sale of McGraw-Hill Education, which, again, closed in the first quarter; the achievement of $175 million of cost reductions; the distribution of $3.1 billion through share repurchases and dividends; and the investment in numerous acquisitions to add to the future growth of the company. Simply put, 2012 was an outstanding year, and we look forward to continuing that progress in 2013.", "As we also -- as we head into 2013, we have heard that we're confronted with new litigation. We have put the best people on the case to defend the interests of our customers and our shareholders. And rest assured, we will vigorously defend against these erroneous claims.", "And with that, we will now take your questions. So let me turn back over to Chip, and, Chip, will you provide everyone with dial-in instructions?", "Robert S. Merritt", "Sure, Terry. Just a couple of instructions. [Operator Instructions] And now, we'll take your first question. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "This question comes from William Bird with Lazard.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk about the amount of buybacks assumed in the outlook and also whether a component of it is accelerated.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Go ahead, Jack.", "John F. Callahan", "Bill, right now, we're just affirming that, today, share repurchase is part of the 2013 program. In terms of the specific amounts, we want to retain some flexibility as the year transpires. Your question about will we consider it an accelerated action, that's a possibility, but we haven't made any definitive conclusion on that. But again, we're not -- we don't intend to be back into the market until we actually receive the proceeds from Education, which will be towards the end of the first quarter. But we'll give you more of a complete update as we get through the year.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And as a follow-on, would you be willing to add leverage to buy back more stock?", "John F. Callahan", "I don't really feel a need to do that over the near term, Bill, right now, but I certainly understand the opportunity from a longer-term point of view.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. And, Bill, the cash generation capability is so strong that we think that even in -- if we go to an accelerated position, that we'd be in pretty good shape for that. But again, we'll wait for the proceeds in March, and we'll go from there. But share repurchase is going to be a very important activity for us in 2013.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And could you share what the next steps are in the DOJ process?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Let me ask Ken to do that. Ken?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Yes. There will be a schedule established by which we will be required to respond to the complaint, and that will be probably in the next 60 to 90 days.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "First, just a question on the legal side. In terms of all the states that are teaming up together in many ways to -- for the lawsuit, can you maybe help us understand what the difference is between what happened in Ohio, which you noted obviously went in favor of all the rating agencies, and Connecticut, which is leading, I guess, the coalition here and their specific case, I guess, is heading to trial next year. So I just wanted to understand what the difference there between Ohio and the rest of these guys are now.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Yes. I'd be happy to do that. The Ohio case related to investments made by pension funds, and they were suing for their alleged losses, hundreds of millions of dollars of alleged losses. And both the District Court and the Court of Appeals in the Sixth Circuit dismissed those cases for a variety of legal reasons. The state Attorney General cases that we are now addressing and that some that have already been brought by Connecticut and other states are not brought on behalf of investors, except in one case, which we can talk about, the California case. Generally, these deal with consumer deception claims, that consumers in each of these states were allegedly deceived by representations made by S&P, and in some case, other rating agencies, that they were independent, that they were objective in arriving at their rating. So these are different cases. These are deception cases brought, based on statements about independence and objectivity. The Ohio case you referred to was relating to investment losses brought by various pension investors.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Then -- I guess then related to Connecticut, can you just explain I guess -- I guess it's been 2 years or so since the case has been ongoing, and now they've been sent to trial. Can you help us understand what the decision was to send it to trial? Like it seems like you guys disagree clearly.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Yes. There was a threshold ruling or rulings on motions to dismiss, and so the case is now in the next phase. There's no decision on the merits in that case. We're just in the next phase, which involves discovery and elements leading up to whether there will be another motion to try to dismiss the case. So there's no decision on the merits in that case. There were preliminary decisions on dismissal motions.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just one question on the guidance. In the Indices section, the plus 20%, I guess, revenue growth you guys guided to, seems like it's a little light than the $500 million you had noted when you first made the acquisition. Am I reading that right, and maybe why so?", "John F. Callahan", "Yes, Manav. It's probably a little bit lighter relative to the initial story. I just think some of the market activity that we've seen, particularly relative to volatility in the third or fourth quarter has -- is not quite as robust as we had seen in the back half of '11 into '12. So it's probably a bit, but again, we're being conservative about our outlook there again, because this is so hard to predict, the volatility in the marketplace there. But we still -- we're still very, very excited about how those 2 businesses have come together, and we're really looking forward to accelerated growth over the long term.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. And, Manav, it's a little early on, but one of the things I was talking about is the switch from outflows to inflows from actively managed equity funds into index fund. It's a trend that's not only taking place here domestically but worldwide, and we see tremendous uplift in terms of volumes on this one. One of the reasons that we wanted to break out S&P Dow Jones Indices so that you could see those numbers, and we'll keep those in front of us as we go forward, is so that you can see not only the growth, but the value creation in those. And we're very, very excited about this business.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got it. And then last question, just to understand, obviously, in terms of use of cash going forward. Just on your M&A strategy, should we be expecting more sort of tuck-ins like we've seen at Cap IQ and then, I guess, Kingsman at C&C? Or I guess can you maybe just help us understand your pipeline and maybe appetite for larger deals?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, again, the 4 uses of cash, we are focused on dividend and share repurchases. Both of those, they're no change, and we're going to be very active in both. In terms of transactions and organic growth, we like to focus more on the organic growth, and that's why we break it out. And so what we are looking for is more specific capabilities in terms of transactions that can help some of our platforms in -- and some of our data and analytic platforms in our businesses. So to that extent, tuck-ins is probably a good word. But what we're looking for is added skills and capabilities to enhance the platforms that we have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So 2 questions for Ken. Ken, I was hoping you might give us a little more color in terms of the process and time line on the DOJ case, beyond the response to the complaint in the next 60 days. And then secondly, on the state cases, can they be addressed on a global basis, or do you have to address them one at a time?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Well, on the DOJ, as I said, we will be required to respond to the complaint sometime within the next 90 days. And depending on what happens at that stage, then there will either be motion practice or discovery. And we intend to defend this case vigorously, so we will be pursuing all relevant discovery to defend against these claims of fraud against the company. As to the states, it's still early days. We will be exploring whether there's a possibility of coordinating with respect to some discovery activity, so that witnesses can testify once for several state proceedings, but it's early days so that has not yet been resolved.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And what -- how about just in terms of -- as we think about the time line around DOJ, would this be potentially going to trial in 2014?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "It's hard to predict because we're still at the outset of scheduling and determining how much discovery will be necessary and what motion practice will be necessary. But I think 2 to 3 years would be a reasonable estimate, if not more, depending on how those various stages of litigation go and the calendar of the court.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And on the fundamental front, Terry, the company has posted very impressive margin improvement in the Commodity & Commercial in the Cap IQ index business in the last couple of years, and the guidance implies some further upside. How do we think about the next couple of years? Are we approaching target levels in terms of margin? How meaningful is there room for further upside?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, again, I think that for McGraw-Hill Financial, there's a couple of things. The first one is revenue growth. We see very, very strong revenue growth here. And with that kind of capability, we think that from an expense standpoint, that if we can manage that very efficiently, that we could get higher operating profits and, therefore, margin expansion. So I wouldn't put targets at this point. I am more focused on the revenue growth generation. And again, I think that one of the things that we've been breaking out and we've been very successful at is the organic part. And so our own creativity and ingenuity is at the forefront, and so we're pushing aggressively on that. But I see margin expansion.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, great. And one thing I forgot to ask, Ken, the -- on the California case, to the extent that, that -- superficially, looks like the Ohio case, what's distinct about it?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Well, it'll be governed by California law. It does raise an interesting question, though, because it does allege losses for CalPERS, which are the same losses that we are defending a lawsuit against but brought by CalPERS. So an initial procedural question will be we're in 2 courts with respect to the same claimed losses, one brought by the California Attorney General and the other brought by CalPERS. So that will need to be addressed as we defend the case. But the short answer to your question is it's different law. State law governs each state action. And the Ohio case was in a federal court as well, so we're dealing with California state law and that will be what law is applied to the claims in that case.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "And the state Attorney General cases are all under state law?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "That's correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.", "Craig Huber", "A couple of legal questions, please. Can you update us on the New York Attorney General? What's going on there, potentially, and update us on the Martin Act part of it as well, please?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Well, as you may know, we entered into an agreement with the New York Attorney General back in 2008, and we are in full compliance with that agreement. And that is the current status. We are in frequent dialogue with all of law enforcement agencies across the country and respond to requests for information. But with respect to that agreement, which is a confidential agreement, we are in full compliance with that agreement.", "Craig Huber", "So does that mean then with the New York Attorney General that they cannot file a case against S&P McGraw-Hill?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "I really can't speak to the agreement, because it's a confidential agreement.", "Craig Huber", "Okay. And then on the Department of Justice lawsuit against you guys, why do you think that they're singling out S&P here and not Fitch and Moody's?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "We can't speculate on the Department of Justice's motivations in deciding to sue Standard & Poor's and no other entity in connection with this lawsuit. The facts are that, as I indicated in my remarks, our ratings, the S&P Ratings for the CDOs that issue in this lawsuit, are identical to the ratings issued by other rating agencies. So we don't have an explanation, and you'll have to ask the Department of Justice as to the motivation. For us, the question is less the why as in the how. How will the Department of Justice prove a fraud claim against S&P's analyst for arriving at ratings through a committee process that are identical to the ratings issued independently by other rating agencies? So that, to us, is the burden that we don't believe the Department of Justice can sustain. So as to the why, that's for the Department of Justice to answer. The how is the question we are addressing, how will they prove the case of fraud against S&P Ratings when the ratings that were arrived at through a committee process were identical to ratings issued by other rating agencies who are not parties to this lawsuit.", "Craig Huber", "Then on the fundamentals, please, Terry, the $60 million or so cost savings you took out your Financial services operation last year gets to about 1/3 of the $175 million. I mean, that's roughly about 2% of your cost base excluding Education for 2012. Do you think you have more to go of ripping out costs over the next couple of years here?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Definitely, definitely. I mean, again, we're in the early stages -- maybe for Jack, not such early stages. But we're in the early stages of standing up McGraw-Hill Financial. And again, as I was saying to Peter, again, we're focused now with McGraw-Hill Financial on the top line. We believe that we have terrific upside in terms of revenue growth. And if that's right and we manage those expense bases very, very carefully, I think that we can get the margin improvement. So yes, I think that we were conservative when we said that we thought we could get $100 million of cost savings, and we had to get into it. And as we did get into it, we found more opportunities and we were able to get up to $175 million. So yes, I think that there is more to come.", "Craig Huber", "So can you put us a number around that, I mean, sort of looking for maybe another $50 million annualized to rip out of the business?", "John F. Callahan", "No. It's just -- Craig, it's a little premature right now to do that. Look, we're going to let the dust settle and get separation behind the standup McGraw-Hill Financial, but we completely recognize -- well, the first priority is going to be driving top line growth that we now have sort of our productivity phase to more focus on McGraw-Hill Financial. And we'll be back to update you more on the specific initiatives and the benefits of that program as we go through the year.", "Craig Huber", "And then one last minor housekeeping question. What is your plans for pricing for S&P Ratings for this new year and Capital IQ?", "John F. Callahan", "For Cap IQ?", "Craig Huber", "And for S&P Ratings as well?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, in this -- I don't think there's anything unusual about the pricing...", "Craig Huber", "Are you expecting to bring it up -- take it up by roughly, say, 4 to 5 percentage points this year, like you've done in the past?", "John F. Callahan", "I think we're probably in the range of 3% to 4%, which is generally in line with a lot of the -- but let's face it, the biggest part of the cost structure is people. You're looking at sort of -- between merit and health care benefits, you probably have an inherent inflation of around that -- inflation around that same level. So right now, we're sort of in that 3% to 4%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Raymond James.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A question for you on Capital IQ. I just wanted to comment that the mid- to high-single-digit sub growth, I think, is pretty impressive in this environment, and I wanted to ask what's driving that growth. Share gains, new firm formation? If you could talk little bit about that.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, there's a couple of things. One, with the acquisitions that we have gone after, R2, QuantHouse, CMA, what we're doing is expanding the customer base and expanding the skill set in terms of the platform. So you're getting growth in terms of customer retention, and you're getting some market share because of the new capabilities on that. Again, it's not just acquisition. It's also the organic component of being able to understand customer drives and needs and to be able to satisfy. If we can do that without transactions, so be it. If we can do it faster through a transaction, we will on that part. But the attention is on those skill sets.", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "One other question I've been getting frequently is one about legal costs in terms of -- to try to get a sense for what were costs in 2012, what's being built into the budget in 2013 in terms of legal costs and are we seeing an uptick in 2013, because we're heading into what's typically more expensive in terms of discovery and trial phases. Your thoughts on that.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, first of all, let me ask Jack to handle that. But first of all, again, the suits that we have received from the 2007 period, as Ken was saying, 41 of these suits, representing hundreds of billions of alleged damages, have been dismissed or voluntarily withdrawn. The problem, Bill, is that we do everything at the federal level. And when there's so much litigation out there that it takes 2 years, 2.5 years, to get before a federal judge, in most of the cases with these suits, they were dealt with almost the same day that the judge seen them, in terms of being dismissed. So we feel very good about the 41 suits that have been dismissed on all that part. But in terms of legal expense, they just haven't gone forward. So they just sort of sit in waiting on this part. Now again, in terms of -- and again, these suits aren't going to trial on that part. So that's good and that's where the costs build up. But, Jack, do you want to...", "John F. Callahan", "Well, just -- well, it's not our practice to specifically disclose legal expense. However, I would say that it's not an insignificant line item in our income statement right now. We do recognize that perhaps there could be some pressure on that expense going forward into '13. But we consider that both in our overall guidance and our margin expectations for ratings next year. So I think we'd like to leave at this point in time that we can manage it, but we'll update you as appropriate, if necessary, as we go through the year", "William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Very helpful. And then one last question on the legal side. I know that the focus of the discussion so far really has been on defense of the case. And I wanted to just ask the question, a theoretical question, that's popped up from time to time about a potential settlement. And the question is, are there any restrictions, potentially, on structuring such a settlement? How would such a settlement theoretically be structured? If you could talk about some of the options there based on some of the previous precedents you've seen.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Well, we are always open to a reasonable settlement. And in fact, S&P, in the past, has reached reasonable settlements in cases such as the Orange County case and the case brought by Connecticut with respect to municipal finance ratings. So -- and other cases. So we are open to reasonable settlement and discussing reasonable settlements. That will vary from case to case. So the answer is if there's a reasonable settlement opportunity made available to us in any case, we are open to discuss it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Reynolds with Jefferies.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I wondered if I could ask a question on the Education business, please. I guess it would be fair to say the closure, the completion of the trade sale has -- have slipped somewhat. Could you just perhaps shed some light on why that has happened?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "No, I think it's just the normal process. And in terms of Apollo, they first had to go out and get their credit ratings. They've been completing that process, and now they're securing the financing aspect of it. And there was some desire for some more audited results, and so it took a little bit of slippage. But as Jack was saying, we're looking for a first quarter event here and maybe a little sooner, who knows. But everything is on track. And so, again, it's maybe a little bit longer, a few weeks, but everything's on track.", "John F. Callahan", "Yes, Dave. Just technically, it was just a pragmatic determination to go off the fourth quarter numbers, not the third quarter numbers. So there's the audit. So once that's together, I suspect everything will move forward.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And if I could just slip a follow-in -- on in there then. So I've obviously worked through as much of the press release today as I can. But in terms of any indication of how the Education business fared in the fourth quarter, how was business?", "John F. Callahan", "It was a challenging finish to the year. The top line was down. It was down around the 10%, 11%, in line with where our sort of full year results were. But -- and particularly, it was more challenged in the Higher Ed section.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And perhaps -- and just one final question. I had a question which has cropped up with a number of investors, I think. I guess we are clearly not as close to you are -- as close to the credit rating agency business model as you are. In terms of looking forward, do you believe or do you sense that the DOJ lawsuit has any impact whatsoever on your competitive position within the marketplace, or is it an irrelevance?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, actually, we had this discussion yesterday, and Doug is, as you know, he's very close to our clients. And the comment has been that there has been no impact. In fact, there's growing appreciation for S&P's positions on it. Given the capital flows that are going to be required, the capital demand on that part, there's a broadening need in all quadrants, whether it be structured, government, corporates. And Doug feels quite good. You want to add anything, Doug?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Let me just add that, as you know, last year, the global markets, especially in the fixed income area for governments, for financial institutions and both investment grade and non-investment grade was up over 18%, 29% in the U.S. Terry mentioned earlier that there's a very big backlog globally of financial needs as banks deleverage, as countries develop their infrastructure in the emerging markets. We showed a slide earlier that the European markets are still heavily bank-funded. So we see that the demand and the relevance of ratings and research continues to be very high. We have built excellent controls, governance and ways to ensure that our global insights are shared across all of our teams. And in the last week, we have received very supportive comments from our issuers and from investors about the type of quality of research we produce. So we're still moving forward. Our team is dedicated. They're committed, and we're continuing to support the market.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. Thanks, Doug. The capital demand side of all of this, David, is stunning. The nonfinancial corporate securities market, you're seeing huge refundings, as well as new monies. India alone has got to do about $1 trillion of infrastructure financing over the next 5 years and hence, our CRISIL operation in India. I mean, it's a very robust picture, and it's following the capital demand needs.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Ed Atorino with Benchmark.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Ed, if you can hear us, we can talk offline as well. So if you're having trouble getting through, we can talk whenever you need.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenters' slides is available now for downloading from www.mcgraw-hill.com. A replay of this call, including the Q&A session, will be available in about 2 hours.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for The McGraw-Hill Companies. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2013 earnings call. We apologize for any technical difficulties you may have had this morning. If you're still not seeing the slides, please refresh your screen. I'm told that, that will get you through.", "Presenting on this morning's call are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Ken Vittor, our General Counsel.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our results. We trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mcgraw-hill.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results also reflect the classification of McGraw-Hill Education as a discontinued operation.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 512-3151 subsequent to this call.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III. Terry?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thank you, Chip, and good morning, everyone. And obviously, thanks for being with us, and welcome to today's conference call. Today, we report the first quarter earnings of our first year as a new company, McGraw-Hill Financial. By the way, approval of our new name is anticipated at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders tomorrow. The new name characterizes our unique set of businesses. McGraw-Hill Financial is a company that, since its founding in 1888, has continuously responded with innovative new products to satisfy the evolving needs of the marketplace.", "Along with our new name, we will be introducing a new ticker symbol on May 14 and that is MHFI and our stock will continue to trade, obviously, on the New York Stock Exchange. And to celebrate this symbolic change, we'll be ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on the 14th.", "McGraw-Hill Financial is a company that provides essential intelligence to the markets it serves. Our vision is to be the foremost provider of ratings, benchmarks, analytics in the global capital and commodity markets. We will promote sustainable growth by bringing transparency and independent insights to the global capital and commodity markets.", "We are fortunate to have assembled through our own innovation, as well as through various acquisitions, a unique set of the businesses. We have iconic brands and leading market positions in growing markets around the world. We are experts in creating and monetizing benchmarks such as the S&P 500, the Dated Brent oil price, the J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction Award, and of course, an S&P credit rating. Our benchmarks are integral to our customers' commerce, and unlike many other businesses, have remarkable perpetuity. These businesses require minimal capital investment while generating substantial cash flow. And we, as stewards of the shareholders, have demonstrated our commitment to maximizing shareholder value through thoughtful deployment of that cash towards targeted acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and so forth.", "We are excited about our new company and are eager to launch it to the financial world. To that end, we will be launching a new branding campaign in the fall to inform the markets about McGraw-Hill Financial, and as this slide depicts, one of the posters that will be prominently displayed as part of that campaign.", "Okay. Let me now turn to the financial performance during the first quarter. Our full year 2013 guidance called for high single-digit revenue growth and approximately 15% diluted adjusted EPS growth. However, during the first quarter, we delivered 14% revenue growth and 29% diluted adjusted EPS growth up to $0.80 per share. While we are clearly off to a solid start, keep in mind that comparisons will become a bit more difficult because in each quarter of 2012, we delivered sequential increases in revenue and diluted earnings per share. But we're very pleased with the start to this year.", "On this slide, these 2 pie charts should help put into perspective the revenues and the operating contribution of each of our business segments. Not surprisingly, Standard & Poor's Rating Services is our largest segment with each of the remaining 3 contributing a comparable level of operating profit. After a strong performance in 2012, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services is off to a great start in 2013. Revenue for the segment grew 20%, setting a new record for a first quarter. Segment operating profit increased 39%, and correspondingly, the operating margin increased more than 600 basis points to 46%. With inherent uncertainty regarding continued favorable issuance volume and mix, as well as additional compliance spending necessary to comply with the final CRA3 regulations, the 46% margin will likely moderate in the upcoming quarters.", "This chart shows a relatively steady progression of increased issuance in the United States and a similar trend in Europe over the past 4 quarters. While first quarter 2013 U.S. issuance was down slightly, sequentially the mix was much more favorable with a 31% increase in high yield and a 16% decrease in investment grade. In addition, U.S. structured issuance increased in the quarter, driven by upbeat collateralized loan obligation, or CLO, and the commercial mortgage-backed securities issuance. This is a promising as securitization is a great sign that capital is being deployed into the economy and obviously it's creating the growth and consumer demand and some of the jobs that we're all looking at. And we are cautiously watching the CLO market to see if this growth will persist. We also are focusing in on was it merely a rush to get issuance to market before the final FDIC rules take effect that could require banks to incur higher deposit insurance premiums for their holdings of CLO. But we'll see more of that as we go forward.", "As for the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, improving economic conditions, stabilizing delinquency rates and tighter spreads have increased attractiveness of this market. In Europe, covered bond issuance decreased 51% as a result of credit market weakness also bank deleveraging and the impact of ECB's 3-year long-term refinancing operations. Non-transaction revenue grew 9% and was driven primarily by an increase in the equity -- I mean, entity credit ratings as new companies came to market. Transaction revenue grew 36% and was driven primarily by increased issuance of high-yield corporates, corporate mortgage-backed securities, commercial loan obligations as well as bank loan ratings.", "At this point, let me give you a look at the litigation picture and an update. As you know, there has been considerable activity on several fronts recently. With regard to the Abu Dhabi case, a case involving claims related to investments in the Cheyne SIV, structured investment vehicle, that was set to go to trial in the federal court in New York on May 13, the company has settled the case. In addition, the King County case involving claims relating to investments in the Rhinebridge SIV has also been settled. As such, we will be disclosing in our Form 10-Q that the company has settled these 2 cases for a total of approximately $77 million. There was no admission of liability or wrongdoing made in connection with any of these settlements.", "Separately, on April 22, the company responded to the Department of Justice complaint with a motion to dismiss the entire complaint because corporate statements referring to independence and objectivity are not actionable under federal law. And this was determined by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a case involving the very same statements. In addition, the complaint does not include facts showing that Standard & Poor's did not believe its CDO ratings, collateralized debt obligation ratings, when it issued them nor that it had a specific intent to defraud CDO investors. The Department of Justice now has the opportunity to respond to our motion, and the arguments of both sides will be heard by the judge later in 2013. Additional information is available on all of these situations at www.standardandpoors.com/response.", "In handling the State Attorney General's actions, the company removed all of the State Attorneys General actions, except California, from state to federal court and asked the federal panel on multidistrict litigation, known as JPML, to transfer them before a single federal court for all pre-trial proceedings. Oral argument has been scheduled by the JPML to be held on May 30. Seven State Attorneys  General cases have been stayed pending the decision by JPML on our motion for consolidation and the company has filed motions asking courts in other states to do the same. In North Carolina, the federal court has denied the stay motion, but has not remanded the case to state court. And a federal court has granted the Connecticut State Attorney General's remand motion.", "And finally, we have a solid track record, obviously, of defending the company and will continue to do so and aggressively. You can see the details of this track record on this slide, and we continue to believe we have strong factual and legal defenses in all pending litigations.", "Let me now review our S&P Dow Jones Indices business. In the first quarter, organic revenue increased 9% to $86 million and the addition of the Dow Jones Index revenue brought total revenue to $115 million. The principal driver of the organic revenue growth was a 26% increase in assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Indices, which reached more than $450 billion. Including the assets under management linked to Dow Jones Indexes, assets under management surpassed $0.5 trillion for the first time, reaching $525 billion at the end of the quarter. Trading volume of exchange-traded derivatives increased double digits, led by higher daily contact volumes at the Chicago Board Options Exchange for the S&P 500 Index Options and the CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX. Revenue declines in mutual funds and modest data subscription growth tempered revenue growth. While the joint venture realized $67 million of adjusting operating profit, $49 million is retained by our company as 27% of the profits are forwarded to our partners.", "The world's first and largest exchange-traded fund, the SPDR S&P 500, trading with a symbol SPY, reached its 20th anniversary, quite a milestone. Launched in January of 1993 with just $6.5 million in assets, the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund is now the world's largest exchange-traded fund with more than $130 billion in assets under management and the most traded exchange-traded fund with an average daily volume of 144 million shares, providing outstanding liquidity to institutional investors.", "We see great value in forming partnerships with companies that can help us broaden our reach, our scope, our scale. The S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture is a great example. We are pleased that after only 9 months since its formation, the integration of the 2 companies is substantially complete.", "Another partner is the CBOE, a firm which we recently celebrated its 40th anniversary. We recently amended our license agreement with them to extend exclusive rights to certain security options such as the SPX, the most active U.S. index option, as well as the VIX to 2032.", "And finally, we entered into a new partnership with the oldest exchange in Asia, the 136-year-old Bombay Stock Exchange, commonly referred to as BSE, to calculate, disseminate and license the widely followed suite of BSE indices. The partnership brings together BSE's closely watched India index Suite, which includes the SENSEX with the S&P Dow Jones Indices' 115 years of experience in publishing uncompromised global benchmark. A few partnerships, and I mean few partnerships, bring together over 250 years of experience.", "Okay. Now let's move onto the S&P Capital IQ. In the first quarter, this business delivered top line growth of 5%, of which 3% was organic. Two key offerings, S&P Capital IQ Desktop Solutions and RatingsXpress, led the revenue growth. These results were offset somewhat by declines in revenue from equity research. S&P Capital IQ Desktop Solutions had a 10% increase in its number of issuers, and RatingsXpress delivered high single-digit subscriber growth. Last quarter, we told you that RatingsXpress is now available on Xpressfeed. This has been well received and we are winning new business due to the upgraded Xpressfeed platform. Operating profit decreased 9% and there was a decline in the operating margin as the segment integrates and develops newly acquired technology and products from R2, QuantHouse and CMA into various new product offerings.", "I'd like to briefly preview 3 new capabilities launched this past quarter. S&P Capital IQ is known for the breadth and the depth of this data. We extended this capability with the launch of proprietary fundamental data for roughly 260,000 additional privately held Western European companies bringing global coverage to 500,000. The data is as complete as public company data and includes industry classification. So for example, when a client executes a data search, the answer will be populated with both public and private company information. Leveraging the capabilities we acquired with QuantHouse, we launched a consolidated real time data feed to complete -- to compete in this $2 billion real-time market. This new capability addresses industry demand for differentiated, low latency data at different speeds. Further leveraging the QuantHouse acquisition, we launched the Alpha Factor Library. Built from the industry's first Global Point-In-Time database, the Alpha Factor Library is an advanced web-based market analysis and research tool that is updated daily to provide statistical profiles, definitions and ongoing performance for hundreds of quantitative stock selection signals.", "With that, now let me turn to the Commodities & Commercial Markets segment. Revenue grew slightly in the first quarter at 1%. Operating profit decreased 2%, resulting in a 90 basis point decrease in the operating margin. Platts continued to deliver steady growth with a 10% increase in revenue. This growth was primarily the result of growth in petroleum subscriptions. In addition, royalty revenue from petroleum derivative trading increased more than 25% and petrochemical product subscription delivered high single-digit growth. In an effort to improve our product offering, Platts is upgrading its price reporting capabilities by creating a system that will better handle compliance needs and includes new real time news capabilities.", "In the global commodities market, continued volatility has increased demand for transparency and that is exactly why Platts introduced its electronic editorial platform to facilitate price discovery in the iron ore spot market. Platts is helping to facilitate transparency and efficiency by clearly showing the bids, offers and other information in the iron ore market. The information collected from Platts Editorial Window, or eWindow, has further enhanced the speed and efficiency of the Platts price assessment process, helping to transform the iron ore market from a long-term annual pricing system to a flexible spot market.", "Commercial Market revenue decreased 8% in the first quarter. J.D. Power and Associates faced a difficult comparison to record results in the first quarter of 2012 as well as reduced licensing from recent award recipients. However, there were some offset at J.D. Power with revenue growth in China. McGraw-Hill Construction declined as difficult market conditions have continued to impact revenue there. On more promising notes, J.D. Power continues to grow its business in Asia and now derives approximately 30% of its revenue from Asia. Also, McGraw-Hill Construction launched 3 new products, Dodge BidPro, Dodge BuildShare and Dodge SpecShare, within the last 2 years. These products now represent 18% of McGraw-Hill Construction annualized contract value.", "Now, that concludes my review of the company's result in the first quarter. And as we started off and as we were saying, we have a new name, we have a new ticker and we have a new brand identity yet our history of integrity and ingenuity preserves for 125 years. The common thread of our company has been the integrity and ingenuity of our employees. From the Industrial Revolution to today, they have delivered essential intelligence that customers and markets can trust.", "As we look ahead, our long-term growth prospects are excellent because of the people, culture and capabilities of this company and the powerful enduring trends in our markets.", "Okay. With that, now, let me turn the call over to Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer, for additional detail on those financials and then we'll be back for any questions or comments that you may have. Jack?", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Terry, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. This morning, I want to briefly discuss several items on our performance and outlook for 2013. First, I want to recap key financial metrics in the quarter. Second, I will detail the onetime costs that were incurred during the quarter. And lastly, I will provide some additional detail related to the balance sheet and our 2013 free cash flow guidance.", "As Terry just discussed, in the first quarter of our first year as McGraw-Hill Financial, we are off to a terrific start. Revenue grew 14% to $1.18 billion and adjusted operating profits grew 28%, driven primarily by the strong results in Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, the impact of the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture and the benefits realized from our cost-reduction initiatives. For example, adjusted unallocated expense decreased 2% in part due to our recent cost-reduction efforts. As a reminder, these unallocated expenses include approximately $20 million to $25 million of stranded costs due to the divestiture of McGraw-Hill Education. Overall, the margin expansion was significant as consolidated operating profit margins increased almost 4 points to approaching 34%.", "The tax rate declined approximately 250 basis points to 35% while noncontrolling interests grew $16 million, both primarily due to the impact of the S&P Dow Jones joint venture. The tax rate also benefited from certain ongoing tax planning activities.", "Adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share both grew 29%. The share count of 284 million shares did not change materially as the 5.9 million shares repurchased in 2012 were largely offset by record stock option exercises last year. All in all, a strong start to the year.", "Now let me take a moment to run through the onetime costs we have excluded from adjusted earnings. McGraw-Hill Financial incurred $44 million in onetime Growth and Value Plan costs related to the separation activities of McGraw-Hill Education. These expenses primarily involved a shift to a new payroll provider, the closure of a data center and a separation of a human resource service center. Note that approximately 1/2 of these costs were noncash. Over the balance of the year, we anticipate that the remaining Growth and Value Plan cash costs will be approximately $20 million to $25 million. All in all, the onetime costs in separation are winding down.", "In addition, the company incurred approximately $77 million of legal settlement costs associated with Abu Dhabi and King County cases. While the costs were reflected in the first quarter income statement, they will not appear in the cash flow statement until the second quarter.", "Now I want to provide detail on several large cash-related items that occurred during the first quarter. Upon closing the sale of McGraw-Hill Education, we received the net proceeds of $2.2 billion. This includes gross proceeds of $2.4 billion less approximately $200 million of closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital true-ups. Since there was a sizable gain on the sale, approximately $300 million of taxes are due but have not yet been paid. In total, net proceeds were approximately $1.9 billion, which is consistent with the estimates we provided previously. Upon receipt of the cash, we immediately took 2 actions: first, we repaid approximately $450 million of commercial paper that was originally issued in the fourth quarter to fund the $700 million special dividend; secondly, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction. As of the end of the quarter, we had an exceptional balance sheet with $1.9 billion of cash and only $800 million of long-term debt. Our overall debt is now reduced by 1/3. We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet going forward to both build the business, and as appropriate, return cash to shareholders.", "I do want to review the impact of the accelerated share repurchase transaction. As it was executed in late March, the shares received had little impact on shares outstanding during the first quarter. The transaction will reduce diluted average shares outstanding in the second quarter by approximately 8.6 million shares. In addition, when the ASR is concluded, we will receive a modest number of additional shares. Fully diluted share count in the second quarter should be approximately 276 million shares, although it could be impacted a bit by ongoing option exercise activity.", "Now I want to provide additional detail to clarify our 2013 free cash flow guidance. There were 3 key items that due to their timing will reduce 2013 free cash flow. First, while we took numerous Growth and Value Plan restructuring charges in 2012, not all of the cash was paid out in 2012. We estimate that approximately $100 million will be paid out during 2013. Second, because of Hurricane Sandy, the IRS allowed fourth quarter estimated tax payments that are normally made in December to be paid in February. This payment was approximately $130 million and was paid in the first quarter. Third, incentive compensation is expensed in the current year and paid out in March of the following year. Since 2012 performance was well above 2011, the cash paid out in March 2013 was approximately $70 million greater than 2012. Again, these incentive payments were made in the first quarter. Collectively, these 3 items reduced our 2013 free cash flow by approximately $300 million. After the impact of these items, our operating cash flow guidance remains $650 million to $700 million.", "Summing up, we are off to a solid start to the year. We are maintaining our existing earnings per share guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 despite the loss of interest income as a result of the elimination of the $250 million 8.5% note from the sale of McGraw-Hill Education, which was included in our initial outlook. Let me remind you that the overlaps over the balance of the year become increasingly more difficult due to a very strong second half of 2012. Overall, we anticipate solid top and bottom line growth for the full year. Our balance sheet is exceptional and continues to provide us with considerable flexibility to enhance the value of McGraw-Hill Financial going forward. The first year of McGraw-Hill Financial looks promising.", "With that, now let me turn the call back over to Terry.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thanks, Jack. And again, we're obviously pleased with the start of 2013 and the first quarter earnings with revenues up 14% and EPS from continuing operations up 29% to $0.80. We're very pleased with how the businesses are performing, and we're making also a very considerable progress on the legal front.", "Okay. With that said, let's open the call now to your questions or comments, and let me ask Chip Merritt to take charge of that part. Chip?", "Robert S. Merritt", "All right, Terry. [Operator Instructions] And now operator, we will take the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A couple of questions. So first, on the Ratings side, obviously the 600 basis point margin improvement, could you maybe just run through some of the drivers of that? I mean, was a big part of that just sort of the CMBS revenues that you didn't have last year?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, Manav, that's exactly right. I mean, the big thing on the Ratings side is, besides the general issuance, part of it has been on the structured finance side. In terms of some of the high-yield issuance, some of the CLO, collateralized loan obligations, some of the commercial mortgage-backed security market, it was the structured finance side that really drove that part of it. And again, with U.S. issuance, corporate issuance, a little bit down and also in Europe, it was the structured finance side that really carried the day.", "John F. Callahan", "And I would just add that it was very strong cost management performance with costs growing well behind revenues, in part driven by some of last year's cost initiatives.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the Platts side of the business, maybe you can help us understand if there's some seasonality about the trends. It seems like total growth has obviously been decelerating now and was just curious what sort of commentary you can provide there. And also if there was any contribution at all this quarter from the Kingsman acquisition?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. First of all, Platts is a really very consistent, steady performer. Revenues were up 10% here. And again, what we're doing is expanding the product offering platform. We were talking about the iron ore market, but again, both in terms of oil, petrochemicals and the like, the pricing assessment and price discovery business we're up to providing some 12,000 pricing assessments and benchmarks a day and that's fueling spot markets literally all around the world. On Kingsman, obviously, we're expanding the portfolio in terms of the commodity side of it, and the sugar platform is one that's only getting stronger. So we're very, very pleased with where Platts is and how it's going. But it's, again, it's something that we'll keep in front of us all year long. But as we expand the platform base to more commodities, we're going to be focusing on the price assessment capability there.", "John F. Callahan", "The Kingsman acquisition specifically added about 150 basis points to the growth at Platts. So the organic growth continues to be quite strong, high-single digits. And now that, that business is approaching $1 billion, that's becoming quite a considerable business [indiscernible]", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And just last question. On the Indices side, you talked about the integration being complete. Is the potential cost takeout sort of already reflected in the margin this quarter or should we be expecting to see improvements from the levels here?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, you know us. I mean, we always want to try and improve upon anything and everything. But no, from a cost standpoint and the integration standpoint, you can consider at this point the integration that we were undertaking is complete.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.", "Craig Huber", "My first question, if I could ask. Last quarter, you guys provided detailed guidance by segment for operating profit growth and revenue growth. I was wondering if any of that changed in your guidance model given that you are keeping your EPS guidance the same?", "John F. Callahan", "Craig, at this point in time, I wouldn't -- it's only -- only have one quarter behind us right now. So I'd probably stay with our existing guidance by segment. Admittedly, maybe there's a bit more risk relative to some of the projections in Commodity & Commercial given some of the tough overlaps that particularly the Commercial business had in Q1 and then maybe a tad of upside in Ratings. But right now, I think that general -- the guidance we gave I think we'd stick with that.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. And again, as Jack is saying, Craig, it's one quarter. And we're very pleased with that one quarter, but again, we will see as we go forward. And again, in 2012, as we were saying, sequentially, the -- each quarter got a little stronger in 2012. So we're going to have to watch the comparisons there. But obviously, a very strong start to the year.", "Craig Huber", "And my next question, please. Can you talk a little bit fuller about why your organic revenue growth in S&P Capital IQ only grew 3% in the quarter, please?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Again, it has more to do with the integration of the acquisitions and we're very pleased with the capabilities they're bringing us. But again, in terms of R2, QuantHouse, CMA, again it's extending and expanding our product base and that is very, very important to us at this point. We will look forward more to the second half of this year for contribution from that. But at this point, it's been a development of the product base. There's also, I mean, from a marketplace standpoint, it's a little bit of a weaker marketplace. You're seeing a fair number of layoffs on the financial markets side in all of that and so we're being impacted a little bit from that standpoint. But more importantly to us is expanding and developing the product platform. That will benefit us big time later on.", "Craig Huber", "And also, Terry, if you could just -- your second quarter sort of outlook internally for S&P Ratings transaction revenues, given the backlog you're looking at and we've seen the first month here, could you just talk about the puts and takes, how it's maybe changing better or worse versus first quarter trends?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, and here, I mean, you really got to take a look at overall economic conditions. One of the things that we're seeing is by sovereigns, in particular, is an awful lot of emphasis on infrastructure financing and that should benefit us and we're going to need to see that new issuance continue. But again, we're benefiting right now from the resurgence of a structured finance market, especially in the high-yield area, bank loan ratings, CLOs and so forth. And that portends well because that means capital is being deployed, which is going to be very, very helpful to overall growth. But what we want to see pick up is we want to see more of the traditional corporate issuance, corporate securities, continue. And again, remember over the next 5 years, we're looking at some $46 trillion globally of new monies and refundings in that area and that's been a little quiet at this point. So we want to see a pickup on that side. But other than that, we want to really just focus in on general economic conditions and how capital is being employed. And right now, it's in some of the high-yield area rather than some of the more traditional areas.", "John F. Callahan", "And Craig, our guidance assumes pretty good growth in Q2 on the transaction side, but it does slow considerably kind of given the overlaps that we see in the back half of the year and also it's hard to look ahead that far, so -- but just keep in mind, the overlaps will get more challenging as we get deeper into the second half of the year.", "Craig Huber", "Understood. If I could just squeeze in one here on the legal front here. Can you update us real quick -- maybe I missed this -- the number of lawsuits you have still outstanding? And then also, Terry, can you just talk briefly about the dynamics behind the legal settlement you guys just announced for Abu Dhabi?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. I mean, again, I mean, the legal situation overall has -- it takes time, for one. We do everything in the federal courts and anytime you pick up a suit, it takes almost 2 years to get before a judge. One of the nice things that we've benefited from is that 42 lawsuits have been dismissed or dropped almost immediately once it gets before a federal judge. And so we're pleased with that part of the record in all of that. But it just takes time. But we've got a very, very good track record on this and for good reason on this part. As part of the Abu Dhabi case and the King County situation, look, we were faced with going to trial on May 13 here in New York. And we looked at the situation, the case on the merits did not hold up. We felt very good about our position on this thing. And that's why it led to a very reasonable situation where, from a practical business standpoint, we decided to settle it and make it go away. And we've said all along that in situations, we're not against a settlement, but it's got to be a reasonable situation and we'll continue to work on that basis. But yes, we're very pleased that those have gone away now and it lightens the burden. Let me ask Ken Vittor, General Counsel. Ken, do you want to add anything to that?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "We look at every case on its own and we made a judgment on a variety of -- using a variety of factors that it was in the best interest of the company, our employees and our shareholders to settle the Abu Dhabi and the King County cases.", "Craig Huber", "How many lawsuits do you have still outstanding, please? I'll let you go.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Approximately 2 dozen.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from William Bird with Lazard Capital Markets.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Jack, I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little more, you touched on your expectation for continued strength in transaction-based issuance. Just was wondering if maybe you and Terry could comment on the ratings pipeline. And then secondly, was wondering if you could talk just a bit about additional avenues for cost efficiency. You mentioned that $20 million to $25 million of stranded costs. Is that something that you can get out over time?", "John F. Callahan", "Let me comment first on sort of the issuance outlook. Just to reaffirm, I think looking for the first half of the year for 2013, I think it's going to be quite good. I don't know if Q2 is going to be as good as Q1, but I think it's still going to continue to be good, in part driven kind of what activity looked like last year. I think, we are, on the other hand, a bit more -- look, we do have some challenging overlaps, particularly as we get to the back half of Q3 and certainly in the fourth quarter. So we had extraordinarily robust activity, particularly in Q4 of last year. So I just think we're trying to be mindful of that overlap ahead of us. But for right now, I think we feel good about issuance and it's also nice to see us doing better -- or expanding our reach in places of structured finance where maybe we were not participating to the degree that we are now. So in balance, feel very good about the progress that we're making.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, and Bill, as we were saying, the story in the first quarter is really on the structured finance side. And it's the high-yield market, bank loan ratings, CLOs, all that, CMBS that really fared well. We want to see more of the traditional corporate security market issuance start to come back. There's also another one that we need to keep an eye on and that's Europe. Europe is obviously, in the aggregate, in recession and all that. We need to see some pickup coming out of Europe. Europe is a bit flat right now and we want to see a little bit more resurgence there.", "John F. Callahan", "And Bill, in answer to your second question on cost, our guidance for this year does include some continued benefits from some of the cost actions that we have and are continuing to make. But we recognize longer term going to 2014 that we do believe that there's some additional cost opportunities and we're working on parts of that program. I do think we can get at some of these stranded cost issues. But it'll just take a bit of time to kind of work through that. So you should anticipate our continued focus on productivity going forward.", "William G. Bird - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And then separately, a question for Ken. How do you see the timeline on both the DOJ case and the CalPERS case as you kind of look ahead?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Well, the DOJ case, as you know, we moved to dismiss the entire complaint on April 22. The parties will exchange briefs, the government gets to respond and then we get to reply. Oral argument has not been scheduled, but I anticipate it will take place sometime in the next several months. And then the timing of the case will be dictated by what happens as a result of the judge's ruling on our motion to dismiss. The CalPERS case has been going on for several years now and is currently on appeal on our dismissal motion under the anti-SLAPP statute. So it's hard to judge what the timeline will be on that until that appeal is resolved.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Terry, the margin performance obviously at S&P has been very impressive and I understand there's incremental regulatory costs coming in. But I'm just wondering how you think about sustainable levels of margin in this business? And specifically, I'm wondering if recovery in the structured finance business could be a driver of margin upside potentially near term or over the next couple of years?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes -- no, no, no. We were obviously very pleased with the margin contribution in the first quarter for S&P Rating. As Jack said, there was a very defined cost improvement initiative that was undertaken that helped. But also, as you said, it was structured finance. And again, when you start talking about some of the high-yield bank loan ratings, CLOs, all of those kind of thing, they're going to participate at a higher margin level in all of that. So I was very pleased to see that. I think that 46% is a great number, but it might moderate a little bit from that. I mean, I think that's a little above where we anticipated. And as we see more traditional corporate issuance and hopefully Europe corporate issuance pick up, it'll be at a little bit of a lower-margin level. And so I would see the number coming off a little bit. But it's still going to be -- our anticipation it's going to be a pretty good number for the year.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I was actually, Terry, more interested over the next couple of years -- just the thought that if structured finance, which is still at a relatively low level, continues to recover, would that imply that there is still upside in margins over the next couple of years? And just what the appropriate level of margin for that business might be?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, I mean I would be guessing a little bit on this one. I think right now, Peter, that the fact that we saw this resurgence in the structured finance area is very good because we weren't anticipating it to the extent that it came through. But it also, again, as we were saying, it really speaks well overall for the economy and especially here in the States that money is being deployed into a number of projects that are going to lead to more growth and hopefully jobs and all that. So it speaks well to some of our situation. We want to see that obviously also benefit the European market. By the way, the other one, Peter, that you mentioned was on the regulatory side. Again, that's an ongoing process and we deal with numerous regulators around the world and we'll continue on that part. But right now, I don't see that having a overburden to the margin levels. And at this point, I would say that somewhere in the mid-40s, early 40s, somewhere around there, if you're looking out over a couple of years that we'd be able to maintain that. But let's see what structured does for the rest of the year. And also, let's see where the resurgence in some of the corporate security markets is.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the regulatory side, can you just give us a little snapshot of the major things we should be watching? In particular, I'm wondering on the Franken issue what probabilities you're putting on that being implemented and how significant you think that might be to the business?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, as you know, on May 14 -- May 14, right, Ken?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "That's correct.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "On May 14, there's a rating agency roundtable in Washington, and I'm sure the Franken Amendment is going to get some attention and all of those kind of things. I see overall -- by the way, our relationship with the SEC has to be a very, very good one and we work very hard in making sure of that. We are as interested as anyone is in terms of strengthening the process of our ratings and all of those kinds of things and want the highest quality that we possibly can. Doug Peterson, our President of S&P Ratings, will be at that roundtable meeting and will express exactly our attitude towards how to continue to improve and build on and so forth. But at this point, it will be a steady process and everybody can weigh in, but we have the most vested interest in making sure that process improvement is at the highest level.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then last thing, can you just remind me, Terry or Jack, the non-transaction component of revenues within S&P, how much visibility is there on that looking out over the next year, let's say? And I'm asking this in the context of given how strong new issuance was last year, I'm wondering if that gives you better visibility in terms of the non-transaction revenues then going over the balance of this year?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, what may help that a little bit going forward is we've had a -- in some cases, while we've been growing the non-transaction part of the business in places, we've also had some falloff in parts of -- from some of the legacy issuance going back a little bit. And that leaky bucket part of that on the non-transaction side appears to be moderating. So obviously, we were very, very pleased with this non-transaction growth that we had in Q1. I don't anticipate that level of high growth for the balance of the year. However, we do anticipate it to be quite strong relative to what we saw recently. And I do think that may be a bit more stable as we start to get out into 2014. It's a little bit too early to be providing too much precise guidance in that area. But I think we feel a little bit more bullish about that than maybe we did a year ago.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Reynolds with Jefferies.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Covering McGraw-Hill is often -- calls on a variety of skills and being a financial as well as a legal expert seems to be the order of the day. I'm not supposed to ask you any questions you can't answer, but I was wondering whether you could perhaps provide some color with regard to how you approach the strength of your balance sheet and any potential liabilities arising going forward from settlements or other legal events? How do you manage that level of uncertainty, I guess?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, first of all, and again I'll let Ken address sort of the legal outlook aspect of this. I mean this is a number of years, like 5.5 going on 6, since the financial crisis and overall things are beginning to moderate a little bit. Again, on legal suits, 42 have been dropped or dismissed. As Ken mentioned, you still have about 2 dozen cases that need to get before a judge and all of those kind of things. So we feel pretty good on that standpoint. I think the message that we're sending is that we're very excited about these businesses and we're doing well and we're off to a good start in 2013. And we're investing in those businesses. And when we got into December of last year, the $700 million special dividend was a sign that, I mean, you're not hoarding cash or setting up reserves and all of those kind of things. We're running the business to run the businesses. We were very pleased with the $500 million accelerated share repurchase that we announced recently and we'll see as the year progresses on that part. But no, I mean, nobody likes to get sued and all of these things, but we'll deal with it. And we'll deal with it because of the merits and the facts that are in our favor in all of that. But no, we're not -- from a balance sheet standpoint, how you deploy capital is a big question between and -- acquisitions, organic growth, dividend, share repurchases, we have been very mindful of all of those and that's where we're going to keep our focus. And we'll see in terms of share repurchase what more we might be able to do and the like. But at this point, our actions are all straight up and straightforward.", "John F. Callahan", "Look, we have -- we're running this -- we're going to manage this balance sheet like we're running and building this business. So we're lucky enough we have a fair amount of cash. We have a tremendous amount of debt flexibility in our balance sheet. And the reality is, with the margins, the return on invested capital we have in our businesses, we're going to continue to generate a lot of cash. So I think we're pretty confident that we have a lot of flexibility to deal with any of the opportunities or issues that we have in the coming years ahead.", "Operator", "We'll now take our final question from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.", "Craig Huber", "I have a follow-up question on this DOJ case. Are you guys aware at all of how the SEC -- have they involved much in this DOJ case, do you know?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "No, they are not a party to the DOJ case.", "Craig Huber", "They're not involved in the background or anything as much as you're aware -- is that what you're saying?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "I can't speak to what the DOJ and the SEC are talking about, but they are not a plaintiff or a party or a participant in the DOJ case.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "No, and just the opposite. Just like the rating agency roundtable of the 14th of May, that -- the SEC is our regulator and it's our responsibility to do everything we possibly can to make that process smooth and that's exactly what we're going to do. And from a DOJ standpoint, as Ken said, we have very strongly gone back to our judge and made a motion to dismiss the entire suit in all of that and we'll see where that goes.", "Craig Huber", "My  follow-up question to that, if I could, is you guys are much better aware of this than I am. But in the U.S., as you know, the SEC for years has been trying to open up the level of competition in the credit ratings business in the U.S. as has the regulators over in Europe for a number of years. Can you just talk about potentially the inconsistency perhaps if the DOJ got its way with this $5-billion-plus lawsuit, and it went to that extreme, $5-billion-plus, that extreme and it actually crippled S&P in the marketplace, that how that would potentially consolidate more of that business, if you will, around Moody's and Fitch. If your company really got crippled on that, it would actually hurt the level of competition. Can you just maybe talk about that level of inconsistency, please?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, again, in terms of motivations, you're going to have to ask them why. What we have done and worked very hard on is the how. How can you bring this kind of case the way you can? And the conversations that we had before they filed it with them was all talking about facts and figures about why they're wrong in all of that. But other than that, motivation is up in the air why they thought they could bring it against one or whatever. Okay, Craig.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call.

That's M-H-F-I for McGraw Hill Financial, Inc.com and click on the link for the third quarter earnings webcast.

Thank you for joining us for McGraw Hill Financial's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Harold McGraw III, Chairman, President and CEO; Doug Peterson, President and CEO Designate; and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Ken Vittor, our General Counsel.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our results. I trust you all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com. In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted financial information.

We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors. And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 512-3151 subsequent to this call.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Harold McGraw III. Terry?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thanks, Chip, and good morning, everyone. And let me quickly begin this morning by saying just how pleased we all are with the effort and the care that Chip Merritt demonstrates each and every day. And for those of you who have followed us for quite some time, you'll remember the great Don Rubin. Well, Chip is in that category now, and that's pretty high praise. So thanks for all that you're doing, Chip. And again, thanks for all of you for being with us this morning, and welcome to today's conference call.", "I'd like to begin this call by summarizing the highlights that we will cover today. First and very importantly, after a very successful transition, Doug Peterson will become our President and CEO on November 1. We increased our investment also in CRISIL, India's largest rating agency. And that's up to 67.8%, a fine use of some of our x U.S. cash. Also the sale of Aviation Week was completed. We delivered several records during the third quarter, both S&P Capital IQ and S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered record quarterly revenue. And Commodities & Commercial Markets reported a record adjusted operating margin.", "Despite difficult comparisons and lower issuance than the third quarter last year, Standard & Poor's Rating Services grew its revenue 8% and its adjusted operating profit at 5%. The company repurchased 5.7 million shares during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 15 million shares. We reported 13% diluted adjusted EPS growth despite challenging year-over-year debt issuance comparisons. And lastly, as part of Jack Callahan's financial discussion, we will share our newly increased 2013 EPS guidance, guidance that has now been increased 2 quarters in a row.", "We recently launched a brand awareness advertising campaign. And the purpose is to generate greater awareness among customers, the financial community, regulators and the media about the McGraw Hill Financial brand. The primary message is that we have combined the leading brands and ratings, benchmarks and analytics to become the world's foremost provider of financial intelligence. This is an example of one of the posters. COMBINED WE ARE is the theme that permeates this campaign.", "Okay. Let's turn now to the financial performance during the third quarter. Revenue increased 7%, adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 33.2% and diluted earnings per share grew 13%. Standard & Poor's Dow Jones Indices delivered the strongest revenue growth. But both Commodities & Commercial Markets and S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered the greatest adjusted operating profit growth of 24% and 23%, respectively. A reduction in shares outstanding from our continuing share repurchases has also contributed to the EPS increase. And these 2 pie charts should help put into perspective the revenue and operating earnings contribution of each of our business segments. Each of our segments is a major contributor to both revenue and operating profit.", "We'd like to keep you current on various litigation matters, but there is not a great deal new to report at this time. 33 cases have been dismissed outright, and that's no change from last quarter. 2 additional dismissals by lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts, bringing the total to 13 dismissals. And 10 cases have been voluntarily withdrawn. That leaves us with just a few dozen nongovernmental cases that remain outstanding. Efforts by the plaintiff in the Reese stock drop litigation to reopen this dismissed case have been denied. And by the way, in the court's decision, it's stated and I'll quote this, \"At bottom, the fact remains that plaintiffs have not convinced the court that it should alter its conclusion that Standard & Poor's statements about the integrity and independence of its ratings are not specific enough to amount to a guarantee that its ratings were made without regard to profits, market share or client feedback.\" In the Department of Justice case, we are awaiting the supplemental disclosure from the plaintiff relating to the claims. In the consolidated states case, we're awaiting on a ruling on the state's motion to remand the case back to the state. And only one new case, the New Jersey state case, has been filed since the second quarter earnings call.", "With that, let me turn to the individual businesses, and I'll start with the S&P Dow Jones Indices. Beginning this quarter, all data is now comparable as we have lapped the anniversary of the joint venture formation. In the third quarter, revenue increased 14% to a quarterly record of $124 million. The principal driver of the revenue growth was a 29% increase in quarter-ending assets under management in exchange-traded funds linked to our indices, which reached more than $585 billion. The continued rise in equity prices of approximately 14% and strong fund inflows of approximately 13% drove third quarter consecutive -- third consecutive quarterly record for assets under management, again in exchange-traded funds linked to the S&P Dow Jones Indices. It's important to note that the revenue impact is not as pronounced as the growth in assets under management as the basis points charged are not always linear with asset growth.", "With equity prices near record levels, investors increasingly utilized derivatives that are based upon our indices, such as the S&P 500 Index Options, or the SPX, and the CBOE Volatility Index, or the VIX, to hedge their positions. Volume at the Chicago Board Options Exchange for the SPX and VIX increased 18% and 26% respectively during the quarter. While the joint venture realized $80 million of adjusted operating profit, $58 million is retained by the company as 20% of the profit is forwarded to our partner, the CME. What is truly remarkable is that the entire incremental revenue of $15 million dropped to operating profit. That is just a testimony to what a fabulous, fabulous business this is. During the third quarter, we created 26 new indices and 10 new exchange-traded funds based on our indices that were launched. These new indices help us continue to diversify and grow this important business.", "With that, let me move on to S&P Capital IQ. In the third quarter, this business delivered quarterly revenue with top line growth of 3%. Excluding the lost revenue from ongoing portfolio rationalization of several small products, organic growth was approximately 5%. This was the highest quarterly revenue for the segment. Adjusted operating profit returned to growth with an increase of 10%. Last quarter, we highlighted the 4 key categories that make up the segment. 3 of these, Desktop Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Ratings IP delivered a mid-single-digit revenue growth, while the fourth, Proprietary Research, reported a mid-single-digit decline in revenue.", "While we have made meaningful investments in S&P Capital IQ over the last year, we have also continued to fine-tune the portfolio. Most recently, we completed the sale of Financial Communications and are exploring options for Funds Management Research Europe, or FMR Europe, an independent qualitative research service that provides assessments of fund manager investment process and operational consistency. We expect that as the portfolio progresses, this will become a higher-margin, faster-growing business segment.", "We'd like to highlight new product launches whenever we can, and Capital IQ had yet another. During the quarter, Enterprise Solutions leveraged QuantHouse technology to create Events Driven Alerts. Now Events Driven Alerts is a new offering that delivers S&P Capital IQ's most valuable indicators in a low-latency, machine-readable data form. These alerts contain credit rating actions, including upgrades, downgrades, CreditWatch announcements and credit outlook changes. While this is not likely to be a major revenue generator, we cite this today as an example of how S&P Capital IQ worked with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services to leverage new technology to create this offering. And we will see even more of this kind of collaboration and coordination across business units in the same time periods ahead. We're very proud of this. We call it the power of one, working together smart and focused.", "With that, let me turn to the Commodities & Commercial Markets segment. Revenue grew 7% in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the sale of Aviation Week, which closed on August 1, organic revenue increased 10%. Platts delivered double-digit revenue growth, while mid-single-digit growth at J.D. Power offset softness at McGraw Hill Construction. Adjusted operating profit increased 24%, resulting in record adjusted operating margin of 32.3%. Similar to our index business, the conversion of revenue to operating margin was remarkable here. $16 million of incremental revenue resulted in $15 million of incremental operating profit.", "In Commodities, Platts recorded a 17% increase in revenue. Growth in petroleum product subscriptions continued to be the primary driver of this double-digit growth. In addition, licensing revenue from petroleum derivative trading increased more than 90% as volatile oil prices increased trading activity. Metals and agricultural product subscriptions delivered double-digit revenue growth, while petrochemicals and power and gas revenue reported single-digit revenue increases.", "Building on our recent acquisition of Kingsman, Platts launched Platts Market Data-Sugar, a user-friendly means of receiving the latest historical sugar price assessments from Platts/Kingsman. It provides prices for all of the major sugar markets worldwide with over 30 Kingsman price assessments and over 30 third-party assessments published daily for most commonly traded grades and locations.", "While sugar has been the latest commodity that we have been developing, in June of 2011, we moved more deeply into the iron ore market with the acquisition of Steel Business Briefing. Historically, iron ore prices were established during the annual negotiation among the world's largest iron ore miners and steel producers. By 2008, large gaps have emerged between spot markets and the annual contracts. This volatility created the need for benchmarks from an independent pricing agency. Much of the world's iron ore is now based upon Platts benchmark pricing, and we're very proud of that. The need for benchmark pricing has evolved from physical prices to derivative prices as market participants have a need to hedge their positions. Now this chart depicts monthly iron ore derivative activity. And I might add that more than 99% of the activity settles against The Steel Index, one of our primary iron ore benchmarks.", "There is a great article that describes the changes to the iron ore market that have taken place. And the link to that article is at the bottom of this slide. I hope you have a chance to take a look at it. We think that the evolution of pricing that is taking place in iron ore is instructive for other commodities as well.", "Commercial Markets revenue decreased 4% in the third quarter. Excluding the sale of Aviation Week, organic growth was 1%. We anticipate that McGraw Hill Construction's revenue decline may be nearing an end as new data and analytic products, along with an increase in the U.S. commercial construction starts, bode well for the business. Historically, we have not spent much time discussing McGraw Hill Construction business, so I thought today that I'd take a few moments to do exactly that.", "Now according to economic research from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, the U.S. commercial real estate sector continues to slowly recover from its worst slump obviously in decades. Construction starts in the commercial sector are on track to jump 15% this year. And while there is a long way to go to make up for the 58% plunge from 2007 to 2010, when the country was mired in the Great Recession, the recent increase is very encouraging. During the recession, McGraw Hill Construction streamlined its operations, eliminated low-margin legacy print products and publishing assets, gaining operational efficiencies without sacrificing quality. At the same time, the business invested in its Dodge analytics business to be solidly positioned for a market rebound. This investment produced new database-driven analytic products, like Dodge SpecShare, MarketShare and BuildShare that support the business premium market position. Today and most importantly, approximately 75% of the revenue of the business is from data and analytics, very similar to the rest of the company. Simultaneously, the business took the difficult steps to dramatically reduce costs. In fact, its contribution to earnings has improved as decreases in costs have outpaced the rebalancing of the portfolio.", "Shifting now to J.D. Power. The auto business in China and the telecommunications business in Canada delivered the strongest revenue growth. Economic growth and growing consumer demand have led to the rapid expansion of the domestic Chinese automotive industry, and consequently, strong demand for J.D. Power's analysis and insight into consumer preferences and behaviors. This chart shows global light vehicle sales from 2006 to projected 2020. The most telling data on this chart is that approximately 1/2 of the growth is expected to come from China. And J.D. Power is well positioned in China to participate in this growth.", "Okay. So that concludes a relatively quick review of the business units and their achievements in the quarter, and we're very proud of those. And we mentioned a little bit of the results in terms of the S&P Ratings Services. But let me turn that over now to get a little bit more detail on that from Doug Peterson to handle that. And as I previously mentioned, we are all very pleased and thrilled to be introducing Doug Peterson, not only as President of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services but as our next President and CEO as of November 1.", "So with that, Doug, over to you.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Thank you, Terry, and good morning, all. We noted on our last earnings call that comparisons for the Standard & Poor's Ratings Services segment would become much more difficult in the second half of 2013. And you can see that in the reported numbers.", "Revenue for the segment, however, grew 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased 5%. The corresponding adjusted margin decreased 120 basis points to 42%. While third quarter expenses decreased sequentially, year-over-year, they increased approximately 10%, primarily due to technology-related investment, modest increases in marketing and compliance expenditures. However, headcount remained relatively unchanged year-over-year.", "We were able to increase both revenue and profit despite issuance that actually decreased year-over-year. The increase in revenue was not driven by issuance but rather by increased bank loan ratings, entity credit ratings and rating evaluation services. Bank loan ratings were particularly strong, increasing 73%, driven by a tripling in Europe, primarily as a result of the refinancing of existing bridge loans, maturing debt and recapitalizations. In the near term, we expect the levels of issuance to be impacted by the continuing market reaction to the U.S. debt ceiling, Federal Reserve tapering and interest rate levels overall.", "You'll see that non-transaction revenue grew 9%, driven by increased entity credit ratings and ratings evaluation services. Despite a decrease in issuance, transaction revenues increased 6% as a result of a 73% increase in bank loan ratings. As you see in the table, international gains exceeded domestic gains. This was driven by 16% growth in our European revenues, driven primarily by corporate activity despite a drop in corporate issuance overall. These charts also show third quarter year-over-year issuance decreases in both United States and Europe of 3% and 18% respectively.", "In the U.S., corporate issuance was flat and public issuance was down 19% as municipal issuers shied away from the markets after Detroit's bankruptcy. Structured issuance was strong in the CMBS sector, up 47%, RMBS up 26% and CDOs, predominantly CLOs that were up 88%, albeit all of these were off smaller bases. And these offset the weaknesses in the larger ABS market, which dropped 14% overall.", "In Europe, corporate issuance decreased 20%, but high-yield issuance increased 82%. This was due to record low spreads and diversification of funding from banks. Structured issuance decreased 9% due primarily to the ECB's long-term refinancing offering, known as the LTRO, and its impact on covered bonds.", "Since this will be Terry's last earnings conference call, we thought it only appropriate to highlight a few of the major accomplishments that have taken place under his leadership. Terry became CEO April 29, 1998. In his first letter to shareholders, he wrote, \"Our commitment to our shareholders is to increase shareholder value by serving our markets aggressively and ethically and, like our customers, striving to reach our full potential.\" Since 1998, the company has delivered a total return of approximately 300% versus only 97% for the S&P 500. The company returned more than $13 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And the company continued yearly increases to a dividend that began in 1937 and has been increased every single year since 1973.", "But more importantly, under Terry's leadership, he has transformed the company. In 1998, the company was predominantly a collection of publishing assets. Financial Services represented only 31% of the $3.7 billion annual revenue and the operating margin was 18.5%. During the last 15 years, the company has divested the publishing assets to others who can make the most with those businesses. And it has reshaped the Financial Services segment into the leading portfolio of brands we have today, a portfolio with an adjusted operating margin that has more than doubled since 1998 and a portfolio that provides essential intelligence. That's essential intelligence through leading ratings, benchmarks and analytics to its customers.", "While Terry is stepping down as President and CEO, he will remain as Chairman of the Board, providing his guidance and insights to me and the rest of the management team. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Terry. And thank you, all.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thank you, Doug, and thank you for the kind words. The bottom line is very simple that McGraw Hill Financial is a very, very special place with very special people, who are dedicated to making a very, very positive impact in the markets that we serve. And clearly, as Chairman of the Board, I look forward to continuing to work with Doug and the management team and the rest of the board to continue to build this great company.", "So with that, let me turn the call now over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, for additional details on the third quarter full year and on our financials. Jack?", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Terry. This morning, I want to briefly close out this call with the discussion of several items on our performance and our outlook for the balance of 2013. First, I want to recap key financial results in the quarter. Second, I will review recent changes to the portfolio and the associated onetime items, largely gains that were incurred during the quarter. Third, I will provide updates on the balance sheet, year-to-date free cash flow and share repurchase activity. And finally, I will comment on the increase to our 2013 earnings per share guidance.", "As expected, third quarter comparisons proved more challenging than the first half, but we were able to deliver another solid quarter of growth. Revenue grew 7% to $1.19 billion with organic revenue growing 8%, excluding the sale of Aviation Week, which occurred during the quarter, and the divestiture and selected product closures at S&P Capital IQ. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 11%, driven primarily by the strong results at S&P Dow Jones Indices and Commodities & Commercial Markets. In addition, I would note that S&P Capital IQ returned to profit growth in the quarter. Adjusted unallocated expense increased 10%, primarily due to an increase in excess office space. Overall, the margin expansion was significant as the consolidated adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 33.2% despite a modest decline in year-on-year margin performance in S&P Ratings, our largest and most profitable business unit.", "The tax rate came in at our guidance level of 35%. This was an increase of 160 basis points from the third quarter of 2012. The third quarter a year ago was low due to the impact of S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture that was created that quarter. Adjusted net income from continuing operations increased 11%. And the impact of the share repurchase program can be seen in relatively faster growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share at 13% as average diluted shares outstanding declined approximately 2% to 278.8 million shares. The ending basic share count was 270.6 million, down 2.5%. Overall, another strong quarter demonstrating the strength and breadth of our portfolio.", "There were a number of changes to our portfolio during the quarter. As Terry mentioned earlier, the company did invest $214 million to increase its ownership of CRISIL from approximately 53% to 68%. CRISIL has earned approximately $185 million in revenues during the last 12 months. It has a leading position in India, a broad product line serving global customers and is an essential partner working closely with the S&P Ratings business. Our previous CRISIL investments have delivered tremendous returns, and we are pleased to be able to increase our ownership even further. S&P Dow Jones Indices and the Bombay Stock Exchange completed the formation of Asia Index Private Limited, a 50-50 joint venture. It is hoped that the new company will raise the profile of SENSEX and other S&P Bombay Stock Exchange indices as S&P Dow Jones Indices looks to further extend its South Asia growth.", "During the quarter, the company also divested Aviation Week and Financial Communications. Financial Communications is a small, noncore asset that was within the S&P CapIQ segment. CRISIL also exited its equity investment in India Index Services and Products Ltd. As a result, there were a number of onetime items that need to be adjusted to better evaluate the ongoing performance of the business.", "In our adjusted earnings, we are excluding a $16 million gain on the sale of India Index Services, an $11 million gain on the sale of Aviation Week, a $3 million loss on the sale of Financial Communications and we are also excluding $10 million of Growth and Value Plan costs, which have largely wound down. There was also some limited restructuring actions. In total, we excluded a net gain of $11 million.", "We continue to maintain an exceptionally strong balance sheet. As of the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and approximately $800 million of long-term debt. Going forward, this strong balance sheet positions us to continue to make investments like CRISIL that are targeted at building the business and, as appropriate, sustaining our share repurchase program.", "Our free cash flow during the first 9 months of 2013 was $388 million. As we discussed previously, there were 2 large items that have negatively impacted year-to-date results. First, because of Hurricane Sandy, the IRS allowed fourth quarter estimated tax payments that are normally paid in December to be paid in February. This payment was approximately $130 million and was paid in the first quarter. The second item was a $77 million payment associated with a legal settlement that was also included in our first quarter 2013 results. Including the impact of these items, our free cash flow guidance remains $650 million to $700 million for the full year.", "Now let me update you on our share repurchase activity. During the third quarter, approximately 5.7 million shares were repurchased. So far, in 2013, we have spent $850 million and have repurchased 15 million shares at an average price of $56.70. Approximately 1.9 million shares remain under our existing share repurchase authorization, and we anticipate in completing this authorization before the end of the year. Of note, this 50 million share authorization was approved by the Board of Directors in mid-2011.", "So summing up, we have delivered excellent year-to-date results with 12% revenue growth and 24% adjusted earnings per share growth. And we continue to fine-tune the product portfolio as evidenced by activity during the quarter. Now looking forward, we know that year-on-year comparisons in the fourth quarter will be challenging, particularly for Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. And as we have seen in the last few weeks, markets remain somewhat volatile. Nevertheless, we are on pace for a strong full year results and are raising our 2013 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance from a range of $3.15 to $3.25 per share to $3.25 to $3.30 per share, up $0.05 on the high end of the range.", "So now with 3 quarters of the year in, we are on pace for a terrific first year for McGraw Hill Financial. And today, we have delivered a great last quarter for Terry McGraw as President and CEO. With that, let me now turn the call back over to Terry.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Thanks, Jack. And again, we are well on our way to delivering excellent 2013 results. And as Jack said, we have raised our EPS guidance for the second time in as many quarters and are harnessing the earnings power of our leading brands by providing essential intelligence to our customers. And we're obviously very proud of this record and a lot more to come.", "So thank you, all, for being with us on the call. And now let me turn it back to Chip Merritt, who will provide instructions for the question-and-answer session. Chip?", "Robert S. Merritt", "Thanks, Terry. Just a couple of instructions to our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just starting, I guess, on the Ratings business real quick. I think, Doug, you did a decent job of running through some of the items that impacted the margin, which surprised a little bit with the decline. But can you just maybe go back and just parse out what exactly that was that you would call necessary investments that might have been onetime or what really -- if all of this is ongoing? Basically, the question I'm asking is how does this impact the margin outlook or the operating leverage going forward?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Yes, let me start, then I'm going to hand it over to Jack. So we -- see, first of all, as you noticed, compared to sequential, we were able to decrease our expenses sequentially quarter-on-quarter, although you see an increase year-on-year. The year-on-year increase is primarily driven, as I mentioned, by a combination of technology expenses. We are increasing our modernization of our workflow processes, our publishing, as well as compliance and control systems to always modernize and update and have continuous improvement in our businesses. In addition, as I mentioned, we've had some other increase in compliance expenses, which is partially headcount and partially related to those systems. We see on the top line as well a -- what you saw was a decrease significantly in corporate issuance across the globe. But we were able to make up for that and continue to see growth compared to last year at the top line based off of very strong bank loan ratings, ratings evaluation services and other areas that are allowing us to diversify our business processes and continue to maintain relevance in the credit markets. For the fourth quarter, I'm going to ask Jack to provide a little bit more update on what we're seeing there.", "John F. Callahan", "And I would just add that the third quarter was our lowest revenue quarter of the year. And so I -- some of these expenses have been feathered in during the course of the year. Moving forward into the fourth quarter, it's going to be a tough overlap for the Ratings business in the fourth quarter. We just had a spectacular finish to 2012. But that all being said, on the expense side, we do not anticipate expense growth of this magnitude at all as we go into the fourth quarter as the overlaps also change there. So we're -- we just acknowledge the tough overlap in the quarter on the top line and to remain diligent in managing expense growth as we go into the balance of the year to prepare for next.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. Does that do it, Alex?", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I think that was very helpful. Maybe just, Doug, if I may ask you another question. And I appreciate that you still have a couple of weeks until you really take over as CEO. But obviously, the last time we heard from you was on the last earnings call 3 months ago. And I assume that since then, in preparation to get ready for the new job, you've met with all the business leaders more and more. So as you've done that, any early indications of things that surprised you over the last few months, maybe any sort of items that you see where you can accelerate integration, work on the margin profile for the business? Anything on that end yet?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, you almost answered the question in the question itself. But let me tell you, first of all, I'm really thrilled by this opportunity and thank Terry and the board for the opportunity to take this on. The biggest surprise I've had is that I continue to be really overwhelmed and amazed by the quality of our brands, the quality of our people, the commitment to markets and our customers. And it's premature for me to give you any specific answers. But I do want to reiterate something that I've said before, which is in Terry's letter to the shareholders in 1998, he reiterated a commitment to the shareholders to increase shareholder value, to serve the markets aggressively and ethically. And I look forward to continuing with that legacy and that approach and, in particular, focusing on our customers and our people.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "All right. I guess, I'll stay tuned for bigger updates next quarter then. Very briefly, just lastly on Platts, and maybe you've talked about it in the past. But obviously, the growth is just outstanding right now. But one of the things, in particular, on the energy side, we hear more and more large banks exiting, energy trading businesses' funds shutting down. It doesn't seem to be impacting you today. But do you think the addressable market in that area could make an impact? And if so, any sort of box you can put around that?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, Alex, this is Terry. I wouldn't put a box around anything with Platts on that one. One of the things that we've able to do is really expand upon the whole commodity base. And one of the things that we reported here was some of the continuing initiatives that are going on both in terms of sugar, iron ore and the like. And we will be continuing to adding commodities and broadening out that base in terms of price discovery and price assessment. Again with spot markets cropping up all over the world, again the ability to have prices that can solve the gap between long-term annual contracts and spot market activity is exactly what we're about, and that's what we're benefiting from.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the ratings agency. I know that early in the year, you actually gave some guidance for what you expected the actual segment to grow that would be embedded in the updated EPS guidance. I was wondering if you had any update to that. I think it was previously high single-digits. Any color on kind of how you think we should be thinking about of this fourth quarter dip versus maybe going into 2014 would be helpful.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Well, okay. Andre, first of all, welcome to the team, and I know this is new for you. And we're delighted that you're with us. Let me turn it over to Jack here, and we can go through the guidance for you.", "John F. Callahan", "Andre, I think that your point is a fair one. We initially did give full year guidance of high single-digit for both revenue and profit growth. On a full year basis, kind of given the very strong results that we've had so far this year, I think we would see revenue growth for the year to be in the low-teens and operating profit growth to be in the mid-teens for right now. I'd like to shy away from quarter-specific guidance, but I think that thinking shows that -- and obviously, we're having a very good year and ahead of what we initially had given guidance on back in the first quarter.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay, Andre?", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful. And then I guess, for my follow-up, on capital allocation priorities going forward, you've clearly highlighted a willingness to return a fair amount of capital to shareholders. Should we expect kind of more of the same in terms of run rate and just assume that you're probably not going to take much of a deviation from that until some of the litigation and other matters unfold? Or I guess, this would be more for Doug, if there's anything that we could see, call the change in that before we get some regulatory clarity.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes, Andre. Again, this is Terry. I mean, if history is anything prologue, again in terms of all of the 4 commitments for capital allocation, we've been very strong in terms of increasing the dividend every year for quite some time and also in having a very active share repurchase program. We are also going to be, as we have, in terms of talking about investments and acquisitions and the like, both on the transaction and on the organic side, have focused on that as well. But without making any predictions about what tomorrow brings, share repurchase has been a very important part of our capital allocation program. And I expect that to continue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Arthur with Evercore.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Yes. First, Doug, great summary of the Terry McGraw years. Congrats to everyone, great accomplishment. Just on the numbers, and this is really more, I guess, for Jack. You've noted a couple of times in the call the leverage you got outside of the ratings industry in the quarter. I mean, for instance, Capital IQ costs were almost flat year-over-year, and they've been up quite a bit in the first half. So you are investing in new products. So I'm just kind of curious as to what was behind really the terrific cost performance in all the non-Ratings segments in the quarter and how you're kind of weighing that against new product investment. And then secondly, it's been pretty quiet on the EU investigation of the oil market, trading market in Europe. Any updates there and how it pertains to Platts would be appreciated.", "John F. Callahan", "It's Jack. Why don't I take the margin point? Doug, I think your point that we did get great margin leverage across the balance of the portfolio outside of Ratings, I'll give you just a little color on each. First of all, in terms of S&P Capital IQ, our level of investment in new products really kicked up in the third quarter a year ago. And so that step-up in investments has been lapped to some degree. And so it's a little bit more of a steady-state going forward. We did see going into this year that we hope that we'd return to profit growth by the end of the year. We were pleased to see it in the third quarter. On index, the flow-through was tremendous, as Terry noted in his comments. And I think we're still benefiting there from some of the merger benefits of putting Dow Jones and S&P together, which I think was just wonderful for the margins in that business. And within Commodities & Commercial, it's prudent cost management for J.D. Power and Construction. But we're also getting the very strong growth we're seeing at Platts that comes in at a modestly higher margin that, from an overall mix, really contributes to the tremendous performance that particular business put up in the quarter.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. And again, in terms of all of our businesses, clearly, given the relevance that they play, regulatory setups are going to be very important. One of the things that we have done and Doug has supported and beefed up in a big way is the entire risk compliance and regulatory side. Platts is going to get a lot of attention in a lot of different ways, not just Europe. But let me ask Ken Vittor, as General Counsel, to comment specifically on Europe for Platts.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "There really has been no significant new developments in the EU investigation. We continue to cooperate with the EU in helping them to understand how that market works and how Platts works within the markets. So there are no significant developments on that front.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "And first, Terry, thanks for a great run. You've set the bar high here obviously for Doug. So I assume he's targeting the same outperformance, 3x the...", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Thank you for that, Peter, but Doug's up to it.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Absolutely. We'll expect no less. So in terms of the S&P business, I was hoping, Doug, maybe you could give us just a bit more color in terms of what you're seeing in the fourth quarter. I understand October started slow. But can you just talk a little bit in terms of what you're seeing on backlog of issuance? And in particular, I'm interested in what you're seeing in the Structured Finance market in terms of trends there, which seems to be showing some signs of life and how you're feeling about market share trends, in particular?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "What we are seeing right now on the overall markets are continued volatility and choppiness. We have seen an increase in issuance recently. And what I mentioned in the fourth quarter, there had been a decrease in some of the other traditional ABS markets. We've recently seen the U.S. banks, in particular, given their access to capital and their need to diversify and interest in diversifying funding sources, returning to the credit card and auto loan securitization markets. CMBS has been particularly strong, although our market share in the CMBS area, we've been focusing on using our criteria, which is very transparent and has a focus on the quality of the assets. So despite some of the surge of the CMBS market, our market share has not been that high, it's in the 30% range, but higher than it has been a year ago. So overall, we're seeing corporate issuance a little bit slower and, as I said, choppy after the government slowdown. Many of the issuers and banks that we've been speaking with are looking carefully at the interest rate environment, which means that on the one hand, you've got people cautious about entering markets, and on the other hand, in particularly high-yield corporate issuance, picking up to continue to take advantage of the very interesting and attractive markets. In Europe, we continue to see the deleveraging of the bank environment overall, which means that the capital markets are strong. Corporate issuance, despite dropping the third quarter, continues to see high-yield issuance and smaller global corporates in Europe are tapping the capital markets. So without giving any specific guidance for the fourth quarter, we do know that we have a tough overlap from last year and we are watching the pipelines very closely. And as we said, the beginning of the month was quite choppy because of the U.S. government shutdown.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's helpful. And thinking ahead, the comp obviously is going to be fairly tough going into '14, given how strong this year has been. I'm wondering if you're thinking preliminarily at least that the signs of life in Structured Finance, some of the good things you're seeing out of Europe, maybe the pricing action you're taking, is that going to be sufficient, do you think, to continue to sustain revenue growth for S&P in the first part of next year?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "I don't have a full-blown projection for the first half of next year. But I would tell you that we are carefully targeting our investments and our expenses to match what we expect to see in the markets. We have certain expenses we can flex one way or the other, depending on what we see. But as you heard earlier in the call and you can see in our numbers, we have also undertaken a plan to find other sources of revenue, one of those being the bank loan ratings product, which we had identified last year as an area that we wanted to target specifically. We knew that having bank loan ratings would allow banks to have more liquidity for their loans. It also makes those loans easier to put into securitizations and CLOs. And so we're finding ways, whether it's Europe with the deleveraging taking place in the bank loan markets in Europe, as well as our growth in Asia, which doesn't hit the bottom line as much. But we see that as a very critical long-term area for us to continue to grow. So we will be responsive to what we see in the markets with our products and services. We continually try to find other areas that we can grow and leverage our expertise and our knowledge. At the same time, we're also ensuring that we are flexible on expenses. As I mentioned earlier, despite some of the investments in technology and compliance-related expenses, as you know, the CRA3 came into effect, which meant that we had some people that were working very hard to meet all of those compliance areas there. We've been able to provide service to all of our clients to the markets without appreciable increase in headcount. So as I said, we will be watching the markets carefully and we will be very, very cognizant of our expense base and flex, where possible.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.", "Craig Huber", "I guess, a few questions. First, can you talk about your margin outlook long term here for the Ratings business? And I ask this partly in the context, do you think you could over time close the margin gap relative to the ratings [ph] in your Ratings business?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, I'm going to give you a first part of the answer, and then hand it over also to Jack, who studied this very carefully. First of all, we've been targeting our margins in the mid-40% range as our operating margin. This is the target that we've been consistently looking at. We believe that there's a combination of, on the revenue side, diversification of revenues as we've mentioned with things like bank loan ratings, regional and geographical expansion and ensuring that we are covering all the relevant markets, where capital markets activities are increasing. So we're focused heavily on the top line growth, and in addition to that, on the bottom line. But on the other hand, we're going to continue to operate at a very high level of quality, of assurance with our compliance requirements around the globe. And we want to make sure that we have the best quality of delivery of our services, of our publishing and our data and other types of standards. So we're targeting a level of margins in the mid-40% range. And that's really quite important for us. Let me hand it over to Jack.", "John F. Callahan", "Yes. I don't have a lot to add, though. I mean, I think, building on your point earlier about the tight management of expense, particularly around headcount, that we have to be very diligent the way we add cost to this business, kind of given the volatility that we have in the top line. And just as note, the revenue for this business, for the Ratings business in the third quarter is the lowest we've seen now in 4 quarters, and so it does -- when you have a little bit of that volatility in the top line, we do tend to have a little bit of compression in margins. And I think that's manageable. And we will pace any investments we make in the technology and/or compliance-related activities as tight as we can, given the near-term outlook that we have on the market.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "I think that's well said, Jack. Craig, anything else?", "Craig Huber", "Yes, I do have a follow-up there and a couple other questions, please. But just [indiscernible] Can you just hit on, though, why do you think your margins are lower in your S&P Ratings business than Moody's? And then also, can somebody just give us a further update on the DOJ case, please?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Jack and I have looked carefully at Moody's margins. And we think there are couple of reasons. One of them has to do with the inclusion of CRISIL in our Ratings segment. CRISIL has a slightly different business mix. It is a combination of an Indian rating agency. They also provide outsourcing services, or if you want to call it, in-sourcing, where they do an excellent quality of support work and analytical and data input work for the Ratings business. And then they have a third business line, which is global analytical research that they support investment banks and insurance companies around the globe with their analytical processes. CRISIL operates at a lower margin. And that's one of the factors, which, if you look at, is about 120 to 150 basis points differential in the margin between Moody's and S&P. Another key differential is the level of market share and penetration in the Structured Finance business. And as you know, in 2011 and 2012, S&P had withdrawn for a period of time from the CMBS market and was operating at a much lower penetration of the CMBS market. So there was a significant difference in the revenue levels in the CMBS area, which was another 250 to 300 basis points differential in the Moody's margin between theirs and ours. And additionally, there was another level of difference that we believe that we operate in a slightly different business model with some of our regional offices and the infrastructure that we think is very important to support our businesses, to be responsive to the regulators and local constituencies. We don't know what the difference is of the margin there, but it's critical for us to have a strong global franchise and we invest in that because it gives us presence in the market and allows us to support our activities. So that's really something that we see as 3 of the key different components in our margin differential. And I'll hand it over to Ken to give us an update on the DOJ.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. And Craig, Terry. Just on those 3 points that Doug mentioned, that first one is very, very important. As you know, this is a very global business, and we're all over the world. But the Indian market is going to be a spectacular market for us. And we started early on with the development of our relationship with CRISIL. And we couldn't be more pleased the way how this has turned out. And now that we're up to 68%, and we'll continue to focus on this, so we're very excited about what that business is going to mean to us on that one. Ken, do you want to make a quick comment on DOJ?", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Sure. We are in an initial discovery period in the DOJ case during which the government is required to identify with specificity those securities that they will be litigating on in the case and which S&P will be required to defend. So we will know -- and the deadline for that specification by the government is November 18. We will know on that date precisely what securities are at issue in the case, precisely what ratings are being challenged by the DOJ so that we can then go ahead and aggressively defend each of those ratings. At the same time, S&P is engaged in a very broad discovery effort on the government to discover those documents and those witnesses that bear on a variety of our defenses. So for example, we are asking the government to provide us with all documents supporting all of the government official statements about the housing market during the relevant period because those statements were exactly the same as S&P's statements about the housing market. So we are interested in learning from the government's files what were the documents and supporting information that led to Bernanke and Paulson and Geithner and others speaking about the economy in the same way that S&P spoke about the economy. So those document requests are out there. The next status conference will be held on the schedule on December 16 by Judge Carter in California. And at that point, the next phase of the case will be scheduled.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask about Capital IQ. I think last quarter, you had talked about some optimism that growth might start to pick up late this year and into next year based on some of the new products, and hopefully, a better environment, I guess. I just wanted to get an updated sentiment on that and the response to some of the new products.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. Well, Tim, first of all, again it's a work in progress. And as we broke out the 4 categories that make up S&P Capital IQ last time, we have shown strength in all 3 of those areas. The fourth area in terms of proprietary solutions, we have been making some acquisition and development efforts there. And this had to do with the QuantHouse technology. And so we would expect going forward that, again, this is going to be a higher-margin, higher-growth business. And we wish to continue to do that. And by the way, Tim, for you as well, welcome on board. It's nice to have your representation with us.", "John F. Callahan", "And Tim, let me just add. It's Jack. Look, it's a tough competitive marketplace for those products. We recognize that. But I think the overall growth rate is being impacted because we have closed down a couple of smaller businesses. We exited Financial Communications. So that will be a drag of 1 point or so of the growth kind of going forward under it. But underneath that, the core CapIQ business, some of the Ratings IP businesses are, as we mentioned earlier, have been growing more in sort of mid -- a little bit stronger. And we remain a little bit more optimistic as we get deeper in leveraging the innovation that's just now coming into the marketplace.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Does the end market or the health of the demand feel any better? There's some view that the improving stock market and so forth should drive a healthier customer base for that. But I guess, we don't see it yet in the numbers. Are there any signs of it as you hear commentary?", "John F. Callahan", "Maybe a little bit. Maybe some segments doing better than others. So investment banking, maybe a bit more challenged than investment management, maybe a little bit stronger. So it's not -- maybe plateau-ing the play will be maybe the best way to say it for right now.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one -- the other question, McGraw Hill Construction. You talked about you're starting to see some data points that give you a little bit more optimism. But I guess, are you seeing signs of that in the business activity itself? Or is it more external, just kind of the overall trends in commercial construction volumes that you're pointing to there?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "No. It's both, Tim. One, as we see more recovery in the real estate sector, we'll benefit from that. But also as we discussed, there's been some changes to the portfolio as well. And we look for this business to be very much like many of our businesses, largely focused on data analytics and benchmarks. So no, no, no, we see improvement both in terms of the market and we see improvements also in terms of the construction of the portfolio.", "John F. Callahan", "Yes. Just by its building book of business, we do anticipate from a revenue point of view this year to be the sort of the low mark. And we anticipate beginning to return to revenue growth as we enter into next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James.", "Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. First, on the share count. So you guys bought back 5.7 million shares during the quarter, but your share count was actually up a little bit sequentially. What was going on there? Was it a timing issue? Or was there a lot of share issuance? Can you kind of give a little bit of color there?", "John F. Callahan", "I think it's a question of 2 things. One, there was -- there continues to be a fair amount of option exercise. It's not quite as heavy as last year, but there has been some of that. Also, too, just from the calculation of the fully diluted share count with the increase in the stock price, there's a little bit of an impact. We'll have to -- those are [indiscernible]. And also there was a vesting of an earlier performance share grant that I think also had an impact on a sequential basis.", "Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "All right, that's helpful. And then my second question. So there were a couple of high-profile articles during the quarter kind of accusing you guys of ratings shopping. Can you just talk a little bit about your protocols and procedures to make sure that ratings shopping doesn't take place and maybe just provide a response to those articles?", "Robert S. Merritt", "This is Chip. Just one clarification, both basic and diluted were down sequentially from the second quarter.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "So let me mention that what's really critical here is that our analysis and our ratings are based off of very hard-working independent team of analysts and credit experts that we call our criteria or basically it's our methodology that we define and work on for different products. And since the financial crisis, we have undertaken a thorough review of every single set of criteria that we have across the entire organization to incorporate the lessons learned from the financial crisis. We've updated our models. We've reviewed our models. These are done by a team of experts, as I said, that are independent from the ratings process itself. The first set of criteria that were changed in the organization related to those that had the largest and highest impact from the financial crisis, and that meant RMBS and CMBS. That was followed by other types of structured products, and then banks and insurance companies. And recently, we have undertaken a review as well of public finance and are now just launching a review of corporates, which is at the back end of all of this. So our criteria team puts out into the market for review and review and comments our criteria. We then take it back. We apply it to the markets. And what we then have is a set of products and services that we go to the market on with our ratings. Now in particular, there were a couple of critical articles on CMBS and RMBS. Our CMBS and RMBS, both of our criteria, they focus on the quality of the assets and the transaction and the long-term cash flows that are generated by those assets. And as you've seen deals that were at a higher-quality end of the spectrum, we have been more likely to be included on those deals. When the pricing or there's more aggressive underwriting or optimistic expectations for financial performance, we have not been rating on those deals. We are working very closely with the markets and have different proposals that we're looking at related to ratings shopping. These look at potentially modifications to the 17g-5. I know I'm getting a little bit too technical there, but ways to modify transparency and more information being provided to the markets. But basically, let me go back to where I began. We have a very high quality set of people that focus on the quality of our criteria. It's developed independently, and then it's applied by our analysts also independently. And we see what we get in the quality of the assets and we call it as we see it.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Patrick, this is Chip. I shouldn't have chimed in. I was wrong. Basic was down, diluted was up. Apologize for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Berg [ph] from FBR [ph].", "Unknown Analyst", "First, Terry, congratulations, really nice to see you go out on top. I was wondering if you could just talk about how much of the $1.6 billion of cash is in the U.S. And Doug, just at a high level, how do you think about acquisitions and how the role they'll play in your strategy?", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Okay. First of all, thanks, Bill [ph]. And you've been with us for a long time and we really appreciate your coverage as well. But thanks on that. Let me go over to cash with Jack, and then we'll go to Doug with acquisitions.", "John F. Callahan", "Of the $1.6 billion in cash, a little less than $1 billion is offshore right now, just roughly.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "And on acquisitions, as we've mentioned earlier in this call, we want to have a very well articulated in [ph] a plan for capital, which is defined and worked closely with the board. That would include a combination of investments in organic growth, in investments in acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. So it's premature for me to give you any guidance on that yet. And sometime next year, Jack and I will be working with Terry and the board on giving you more guidance on what direction we see on those. But I think all 4 of those are critical ways for us to think about our capital. And as I said earlier, we want to continue with programs that do provide adequate returns for our shareholders.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. And Bill [ph], as you know, in all 4 quadrants of dividends, share repurchase, organic and transaction, we have been active in varying degrees, dependent upon portfolio considerations and the like on that one. But to date, we've had a very strong dividend and share repurchase program. We look forward to continuing that. But obviously, we also are looking at the areas for other kinds of growth in terms of organic and transaction. But it's obviously always a balance.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from David Reynolds from Jefferies.", "David Reynolds - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I wonder if I could just explore Capital IQ a little bit more with you, please. Proprietary Research obviously is showing a revenue decline in the quarter. Perhaps you could just give us a little more color on how material that is within the Capital IQ division and perhaps in a more normalized environment, where you would see the revenue profile and the margin dynamic of that business.", "John F. Callahan", "David, just generally -- and there's even a few different businesses within our research portfolio, but it's roughly 10% of the overall mix. There are some components of it that are showing some nice growth. There are some others more that have been a little bit more challenged. So it is the smallest segment, but it has been a big a bit of a drag. And we recognize that. And we are looking at a variety of ways in trying to think about how to shore that up as we move forward as we get ready for next year.", "Harold Whittlesey McGraw", "Yes. And the whole game plan on this, David, has been that we're going to continue to work the portfolio in all 4 quadrants that we put out there in terms of sectors. And we're looking at this being a much faster-growing business and a higher-margin. [indiscernible] investments through the QuantHouse technology on the proprietary solutions. And we expect that to be behind us. And next year ought to be continued improvement on that.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call.

That's MHFI for McGraw Hill Financial, Inc.com, and click on the link for the fourth quarter earnings webcast. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for McGraw Hill Financial. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us for McGraw Hill Financial's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Ken Vittor, our General Counsel. This morning, we issued a news release with our results. I trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we've provided adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-K, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "I would also like to call your attention to a recent European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of McGraw Hill Financial should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and, potentially, the company. We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 512-3151 subsequent to this call.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Thanks, Chip, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin this call this morning by summarizing the highlights of what was a truly momentous year for the company. We completed the sale of McGraw-Hill Education in March, probably the most significant change to the portfolio that we could've made. In addition, we sold Aviation Week in August as we continued to prune the portfolio of publishing assets. We launched McGraw Hill Financial with a new name and a new ticker symbol to signify the extraordinary changes taking place at the company. We increased our investment in CRISIL to roughly 68%. CRISIL has proven to be a well-run growth company, and this was an excellent use of non-U.S. cash.", "We achieved record revenue from continuing operations and record adjusted diluted EPS for the year, highlighting what a tremendous portfolio of assets this company possesses. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, S&P Dow Jones Indices and S&P Capital IQ all delivered very strong revenue growth. The company continued its strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders with $1.3 billion in dividends and share repurchases. After exhausting the previous share repurchase authorization, the company announced a new 50 million share repurchase authorization. As you know, Terry McGraw retired as President and CEO after having led this company and served its shareholders so commendably for the past 15 years. Terry, what a tremendous achievement.", "As you can see from this slide, earlier this year, we completed the Growth and Value Plan that was announced in 2011. We believe this plan proved to be a considerable success. After shedding over $2 billion of revenue, predominantly from the sale of McGraw-Hill Education, we are a vastly more profitable company with considerably higher adjusted operating margins and lower capital expenditure needs. More importantly, we unlocked value for our shareholders, who've enjoyed a total shareholder return of 140% over the last 2 years.", "Now let's turn to our financial performance during the quarter and for the full year 2013. Revenue increased 10% for the year. Adjusted operating profit increased 16%, resulting in a 180-basis-point improvement in margin, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 21%. Fourth quarter revenue tied second quarter revenue as the highest of the year. However, revenue only increased 2% versus the strong fourth quarter of 2012. Impacting the profitability of the quarter was a $26 million noncash impairment charge in S&P Dow Jones Indices and a full year adjusted tax rate that was lower than anticipated. Jack will elaborate on these and all of our financials momentarily.", "With that, let me turn to the individual business segments, and I'll start with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. The fourth quarter in 2013, while down versus the very strong fourth quarter of 2012, was the second-best of 2013. The operating profit decline in the fourth quarter was due to both lower revenue, as well as a 4% increase in costs. For the entire year, revenue increased 12%, adjusted operating profit increased 15% and the adjusted operating margin increased 120 basis points to 43.7%. That's the second year in a row the margin has improved by more than 100 basis points.", "Nontransaction growth, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year, was driven by increased entity credit rating activity, particularly in Europe. In fact, during the fourth quarter, we added more than 60 new clients in EMEA. In addition, fourth quarter nontransaction revenue increased due to strength in CRISIL's Coalition and Irevna analytical businesses. While fourth quarter transaction revenue increased sequentially, it decreased from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to a decline in U.S. corporate issuance, particularly high-yield issuance. For the full year 2013, transaction revenue benefited from both healthy issuance and a 42 increase -- 42% increase in bank loan ratings. With an 8% increase in international revenue, fourth quarter international revenue reached 50% of total revenue. This is the highest international percentage since the fourth quarter of 2008, and is an encouraging sign as the European economy continues to recover. High-yield European corporates drove the outsized international growth for both the fourth quarter and 2013.", "During the quarter, U.S. corporate and public issuance were down 18% and 19%, respectively, driven by the government shutdown, interest rate volatility and economic uncertainty. Recall that issuance in the fourth quarter of 2012 was particularly strong, with a rush to market due to the looming fiscal cliff and upcoming presidential election. Conversely, in the fourth quarter of 2013, October issuance was significantly impacted by the government shutdown and the debt ceiling crisis. Structured issuance in the U.S. was flat, with strength in commercial mortgage-backed securities, which increased 35%, offset by weakness in residential mortgage-backed securities, which decreased 43%, and CDOs, predominantly collateral loan obligations, which decreased 15%.", "During the quarter, European corporate issuance was flat, with weak investment-grade issuance offset by very strong high yield, which increased by 71%. Improved economic conditions drove a structured issuance increase of 25% due primarily to strength in asset-backed securities and covered bonds. European high-yield issuance was benefiting from an improved European economic environment, investors' appetite for yield and an increase in the number of companies turning to capital markets for the first time. As for 2014, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services published its expectations for corporate new issuance to grow modestly in 2014 at of a rate between flat and 6% higher.", "Now let me update you on our litigation matters. 3 additional cases were dismissed in the quarter, bringing the total to 36 cases dismissed outright. One case was withdrawn since we last reported earnings. There are now 11 cases that have been voluntarily withdrawn and 13 dismissals by lower courts that have been affirmed by higher courts. That leaves us with a few non-dozen [ph] government cases that remain outstanding. In the Department of Justice case, we are in discovery and the next hearing is scheduled for March 11. In the consolidated states cases, we are awaiting a ruling on the states' motion to remand the cases back to the states.", "One new Constant Proportion Debt Obligation case has been filed in the Netherlands, and a notification has been received of a potential claim from an Italian prosecutor at Corte dei Conti since the company's third quarter earnings call. In the Italian matter, the prosecutor's potential claim of EUR 234 billion would allege, in essence, that by downgrading Italy's sovereign rating, S&P \"interfered in the institutional independence of Italy as a sovereign state, which caused serious damage to its economic credibility and international creditworthiness.\" If any such claim were to be made in the future, we believe it will be frivolous and without merit.", "S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered the largest revenue growth of any segment during the quarter, delivering 18% growth. This growth was primarily driven by increased licensing fees from ETF customer based on AUMs and from exchanges based on increased derivative trading volume. During the quarter, adjusted operating profit decreased due to a $26 million noncash impairment charge associated with an intangible asset acquired through the formation of our S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture. Notwithstanding this noncash charge, costs in the quarter were up primarily due to increased royalty payments, marketing and incentives. By the way, S&P Dow Jones Indices' recently marketing campaign was focused on increasing brand awareness, which in turn supports our customers. Over 10,000 viewers watched over 2,750 hours of our advertising campaign videos.", "For the full year, organic revenue increased 12% and adjusted operating profit increased 19%, despite the noncash charge. In each quarter of 2013, we established a new record of AUMs and exchange-traded funds linked to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Year-end AUMs increased 43% to $686 billion from the end of 2012. Importantly, roughly 1/3 of the AUM increase was a result of new inflows into these passively-managed ETFs.", "We continue to listen to the marketplace and create innovative new indices. During the quarter, 14 new ETFs based upon our indices were launched, providing opportunities for future growth from these new products. Fourth quarter licensing revenue from derivative trading increased. This was primarily due to SPX and VIX trading volumes, which increased 11% and 19%, respectively. At the end of the quarter, the company made the final payment to acquire the intellectual property for the S&P GSCI, eliminating future royalty payments. The S&P GSCI is the first major investable commodity index. The index includes the most liquid commodity futures and provides diversification with low correlations to other asset classes.", "With that, let me now move on to S&P Capital IQ. In the fourth quarter, this business delivered quarterly revenue with top line growth of 4%. Excluding the lost revenue from ongoing portfolio rationalization of several small products, organic growth was approximately 5%. Adjusted operating profit increased for the second straight quarter, although the margin was down slightly. For the full year, revenue increased 4% as we continue to build new products and new data sets. However, operating profit decreased for the year.", "It's worth noting that for both the quarter and full year 2013, Desktop Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Ratings IP all delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth, while Proprietary Research revenue declined middle-single digits. During the quarter, we sold the first Portfolio Risk solution with a 5-year contract. This product offers next-generation risk and scenario analytics to traders, portfolio managers and risk managers for pricing, hedging and capital management of multiasset class portfolios. This is one of several new desktop analytics and capabilities scheduled for launch throughout 2014.", "While there are many areas of S&P Capital IQ where we have been investing, there are other areas we have shut down or divested. This quarter, we continued to fine-tune the portfolio by shutting down Funds Management Research Europe. This was an independent qualitative research service that provided assessments of fund manager investment processes. As a result, we expect that both revenue and adjusted operating profit will increase in 2014. Robust equity markets, new product launches and increased customer compliance requirements also point to improvement in 2014.", "With that, now let me turn to the Commodities & Commercial Markets segment. Revenues grew 2% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the sale of Aviation Week, organic revenue increased 7%. Platts delivered double-digit revenue growth and J.D. Power delivered high-single-digit growth. This was partially offset by softness in McGraw Hill Construction. For the full year, revenue grew 4% with organic revenue increasing 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 41%, resulting in record quarterly adjusted operating profit of $84 million. In Commodities, Platts achieved a 10% increase in revenue for the quarter and a 13% increase for the year. Platts' revenue has doubled in the last 5 years, with 2013 revenue setting a new annual record. During the quarter, subscriptions for Metals & Agriculture and Petrochemical products grew faster than Petroleum, driving double-digit growth. In addition, licensing from revenue from Petroleum derivative trading increased more than 30%, as volatile oil prices increased trading activity.", "In Commercial Markets, revenue decreased 6% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the year. Excluding the sale of Aviation Week, organic growth increased 4% in the quarter and was flat for the year. J.D. Power delivered a second year of strong growth in the quarter and for the full year, driven by the auto business in China and license revenue from customer advertising. Furthermore, the decline in Construction revenue moderated compared to recent years as our new product launches gained traction and the U.S. construction industry recovers.", "Summing up, 2013 was a great year. We completed the highly successful Growth and Value Plan and launched our new company, McGraw Hill Financial. We achieved records in revenue from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS. Importantly, we expect to deliver an even better 2014. Today, we introduce 2014 guidance of mid-single-digit revenue growth and diluted EPS of $3.75 to $3.85 per share, representing growth in the mid-teens.", "During my first few months, we have made a number of changes to improve our management structure and drive growth, performance and productivity. We have appointed Neeraj Sahai as President of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. He brings the right skill set to lead our largest business. We've added Larry Neal, the head of Platts, and Alex Matturri, the head of S&P Dow Jones Indices, to our executive committee. Many of you already know Larry and Alex, who are excellent managers. In addition, Larry will be relocating to London, which is the global hub of our Platts business.", "Following these moves, Glenn Goldberg, President of Commodities & Commercial Markets, has decided to leave the company to pursue other career opportunities. Glenn is a seasoned professional, who has had great success running our Commodities & Commercial segment. We thank Glenn for all of the tremendous contributions he's made during his 23 years with the company. We've also added the S&P Chief Risk Officer and Chief Economist to the executive committee. The entire company will now benefit from their insights and expertise.", "In addition, we initiated a consolidation of our real estate footprint, including the decision to move our company headquarters to 55 Water Street in New York. Finally, on March 18, we will host an Investor Day in New York. I will provide additional detail on our strategy, and each of our business leaders will provide greater insights into our growth plans.", "So with that, let me turn the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, for additional details on the fourth quarter and full year. Jack?", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Doug. And good morning to everyone joining us on the call. This morning, I want to briefly discuss several items related to our 2013 performance and outlook for 2014. First, I want to recap key consolidated financial results in the quarter and for the full year. Second, I will review recent cost-reduction actions taken to streamline the organization and to reduce our real estate footprint. These actions did result in onetime costs, which are identified as adjustments to earnings. Third, I'll provide updates on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And finally, I will provide additional color on our 2014 guidance.", "In our first year as McGraw Hill Financial, we delivered very strong financial results. Revenue grew 10%, approaching $4.9 billion, with organic revenue growing 9%, excluding the impact of 6 months of the Dow Jones Indices business, the sale of Aviation Week and product closures at S&P Capital IQ. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 14%, driven by the strong results at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, S&P Dow Jones Indices and Commodities & Commercial Markets. In addition, I would note that S&P Capital IQ returned to profit growth in the last 2 quarters of the year. Adjusted unallocated expense was essentially flat for the year and the adjusted tax rate decreased 200 basis points, 100 basis points lower than our projected adjusted rate of 35%. This result was primarily due to an increased proportion of income from international markets and progress on several tax planning initiatives. Overall, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21% to $3.33 per share, a great result for the company.", "As expected, fourth quarter comparisons were the most challenging of the year, but we were able to deliver another solid quarter of growth. Revenue grew 2% to $1.25 billion, matching the second quarter as the 2 strongest quarters of the year. Organic revenue grew 3%, excluding the sale of Aviation Week and product closures at S&P Capital IQ. Adjusted segment operating profit decreased 3%, driven primarily by the $26 million noncash impairment charge at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Adjusted unallocated expense decreased 7%. And the lower fourth quarter tax rate is the catch-up that brings our full year adjusted effective tax rate to 34%. Adjusted net income from continuing operations increased 9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12%. The relatively faster growth was the result of a 2% decrease in the average diluted shares outstanding to 278 million shares. The year-end basic share count was 270.4 million, down 3%. Overall, a solid quarter, given the tough comparisons, and a good finish to the year.", "There were several onetime charges during the quarter associated with cost reduction and efficiency actions as we worked to drive productivity across McGraw Hill Financial. We are excluding a $28 million restructuring charge primarily related to severance, as we took actions to streamline Commodities & Commercial, S&P Ratings and Capital IQ. There was a $36 million noncash impairment charge related to the pending sale of a data center, driven by a strategic shift to leverage the scale and capability of world-class IT partners, and a $13 million charge associated with several lease terminations, as we reduced our real estate footprint in several major U.S. cities, in part driven by recent divestitures and the shutdown of specific product lines at S&P Capital IQ. Note that we do not have any Growth and Value Plan costs, largely professional and consulting fees, to support separation during the quarter, as that plan was completed earlier in the year.", "Lastly, as Doug mentioned, the company has decided to exit its Midtown New York City office. In order to do so, a payment of approximately $60 million was necessary as consideration for early termination of a lease which ran to 2020. There was no P&L impact for this item, as it was offset by deferred gains from the previous sale of equity in the building by the company.", "We continue to maintain an exceptionally strong balance sheet. As of the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments, of which about $700 million was domestic cash. We continue to have approximately $800 million of long-term debt. Going forward, this strong balance sheet positions us to continue to make investments that strengthen the business and, as appropriate, sustain our share repurchase program. Our free cash flow during 2013 was $624 million.", "There were several large items that have negatively impacted results. As we've discussed before, because of Hurricane Sandy, the IRS allowed fourth quarter estimated tax payments that are normally paid in December to be paid in February. This payment was approximately $130 million and was paid in the first quarter of 2013. The second item was the $77 million payment associated with the legal settlement that was also included in our first quarter 2013 results. And third, as I just discussed, an approximately $60 million payment was made in the fourth quarter in consideration for the early lease termination of our Midtown location. With these large items behind us, combined with sustained growth anticipated this year, we anticipate approaching $1 billion of free cash flow in 2014.", "Let me now update you on our return of capital activity. During the fourth quarter, approximately 1.9 million shares were repurchased, which completed the existing 50-million-share authorization approved by the Board of Directors in mid-2011. For all of 2013, we have spent $989 million and repurchased 16.9 million shares at an average price of $58.52. In December, the company announced a new $50 million share -- 50 million share repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors. We do anticipate selectively continuing share repurchase activity in 2014, subject to market conditions. In addition, the company paid out $308 million in dividends, bringing the total return of capital in 2013 to almost $1.3 billion. Demonstrating McGraw Hill Financial's steadfast commitment to the dividend, just last week, the company announced that it had increased it for the 41st consecutive year. The 7.1% increase brings the annual payout to $1.20 per share.", "Now I'd like to provide additional color on our 2014 guidance. At this point, we are targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2014. Over the longer term, we believe the company has the potential to deliver high-single-digit revenue growth. However, after delivering 13% and 10% during the last 2 years, we believe it is prudent to guide to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2014. And as a reminder, the impact of the divestiture of Aviation Week and the shutdown of several smaller product lines at S&P CapIQ reduces our year-on-year growth rate by approximately 1 point. We are targeting flat unallocated expense and sustained margin expansion with at least a 100-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. We believe that the effective tax rate achieved in 2013 is sustainable and we are targeting a 34% tax rate again in 2014. On the bottom line, the adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance is $3.75 to $3.85 per share. From a cash perspective, we anticipate investing approximately $125 million in capital expenditures and approaching $1 billion in free cash flow.", "In closing, for 2013, we have delivered excellent results with 10% revenue growth and 21% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. We anticipate delivering continued growth in 2014, as long-term secular drivers of growth remain in place. That said, market volatility could impact results. Nevertheless, we anticipate mid-single-digit revenue growth, mid-teen adjusted diluted earnings per share growth and approximately $1 billion of free cash flow.", "And as a reminder, we will be hosting an Investor Day on March 18 at the New York Hilton Midtown. This will be an opportunity for investors to learn more about the company and meet the leaders of each of our businesses. Reach out to Chip Merritt if you have not already received additional details. We hope to see you there. With that, let me turn the call over to Chip Merritt.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Thank you, Jack. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Could you maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about M&A? There are a couple of assets out on the market. Maybe give us a sense of how aggressive you want to pursue M&A. Given there's still some legal risk out there, how do you think about balancing that with keeping cash on the books, as well as maybe levering up the balance sheet to go after some of those assets?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, I think it's the same answer we would've given you last year or the year before. In any M&A situation, we would look at it in a very disciplined way to be sure that if there was an opportunity that we would have the conviction that we were going to build shareholder value, and particularly now with the very strong balance sheet that we have. We'll selectively look at assets from time to time. But again, we'll be very disciplined, and I think we have the flexibility in the balance sheet to both build the business and address any other balance sheet considerations that may be out there.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "And let me add, this is Doug, that we would very carefully look at price, return, fit. We're not going to just run around and try to look at every single deal that pops up. And it's very important for us to continue with the strategy we've put in place and the type of fit that it creates for our portfolio. And we would highly unlikely be doing anything transformational.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great. And just a follow-up question. You highlighted new cost takeout opportunities, streamlining of some of the management structure, reducing the real estate footprint. Could you give us a sense of how the cost takeout flows through your numbers over time? I know in your guidance, you talked about 100 bps adjusted operating margin expansion. Is the new cost takeout opportunity you're talking about and highlighting something that comes over the next few years? Or how should we think about the ramp-up of the new cost takeout?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, there's -- some of the restructuring actions that we've taken in the fourth quarter will have some impact on 2014. There's probably approximately 2 points of profit growth built into those actions. Now on the real estate footprint, that has more longer-term benefits. While for example, while we are exiting our Midtown location, we will not be leaving that location until the end of 2015. So those benefits of real estate will feather in over a longer period of time. And we'll also anticipate discussing some of the longer-term product[ph] opportunities in a bit more depth when we get together for our Investor Day in March.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from William Bird with FBR.", "William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Could you talk a little bit about what the guidance assumes for stock buybacks? And separately, what does the go-forward cost profile look like for Indices? You highlighted a couple of reasons why the costs were up and a benefit that sounds like it will accrue going forward from the final payment on GSCI.", "John F. Callahan", "On share repurchases, I think if you look at -- we obviously have been very diligent in that area for the last few years. The board has approved another 50-million-share authorization. We do anticipate continuing that activity into this year. At this point in time, we don't want to be overly specific in terms of a target for right now. There is some benefit in our guidance, and we'll update you as we go through the year, depending on overall market conditions.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Let me add that at the March meeting or our investor meeting, we would like to give you some more details about our thinking and our algorithm for capital planning of our allocation between investing in the businesses. We have a very exciting growth story. We want to be able to provide you with that and how we're allocating capital to growth, to acquisitions, to dividends and to stock buybacks. So that will be one of the themes we'll address in more depth in March.", "John F. Callahan", "In terms of the -- your question about the expenses in growth for Indices, look, Indices had a great year. It had a tremendous year, and we look to have another good year of growth as we go into next year. There's nothing on a full year basis that at this point we'd meaningfully say that would significantly change the very high margins that we have in that business. And obviously, there's always going to be a bit of market volatility, depending on what's going on, in terms of overall equity capital flows.", "William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And then just at a higher level, could you talk about just the S&P pipeline and what you're seeing kind of in terms of issuance trend?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Yes, the issuance trend, as you know, in the last quarter of the year was a shift from the U.S. to Europe, generally speaking. In Europe, corporates have been -- and again, the investment-grade corporates in Europe were actually a little bit slow, with the capital markets being driven by mid-market and smaller blue chips in Europe as they need to go to market as banks were reevaluating the size of their portfolio and their capital positions. So we're seeing the continuation of that same trend. And then on the Structured Finance business, you're seeing some resurgence in RMBS, while the CMBS market has had a little bit of volatility but also looks pretty flat compared to last year. The CDO market, in particular CLOs, have also been quite volatile. It's really only been about a month into the year, but we are looking carefully at the pipeline. And at least for the near term, we're expecting a similar pipeline towards what we saw at the end of the year last year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.", "Craig Huber", "My first question is can you just update us on your thoughts for price increases throughout the portfolio for 2014, please?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, this is, for us, one of the core areas of analysis in business-by-business to understand our customer penetration, opportunities we have in areas of people that are already not customers, and part of that analysis is also price increases. In general, we are projecting price increases across the portfolio in the 3% to 4% range. Some of those have already started to take effect. Others of them are peppered throughout the year. But our general expectation is 3% to 4% across the portfolio, although clearly, we're looking to see where we can tweak that and take advantage the most. But clearly, another aspect of that is high-quality customer service or sales processes, et cetera. And that's one of the things we're spending a lot of time looking at.", "Craig Huber", "And also within your Ratings business, can you just talk about the all-important nontransaction line, a little bit further what happened in the fourth quarter? It was a very good result there. But where your expectation is that's embedded in your guidance for 2014? And I have a follow-up.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Yes. So in the nontransaction line, in addition to the approach we have to pricing, which allows us to have certain aspects, less volatility, we also include in there some of the revenues from CRISIL businesses. Irevna and Coalition are 2 that are doing very well. As banks, insurance companies and others in the financial service markets are looking to having productivity and streamlining, as well as much more higher-end analytics, they turn to those companies. So the subscription revenue from those also gets built into that nontransaction revenue. So we have a pretty good outlook on those areas, continued analytics there. And we do think that in the direct Ratings business, we will also benefit from the relationships we have and continue driving issuers towards this subscription, nonsubscription model for Ratings. So we're actually watching that line quite carefully, expecting that it will be flat to growing throughout the year.", "John F. Callahan", "In general, I think the nontransaction line should -- our current anticipation is to grow largely in line with the overall guidance for the total company of mid-single digits for right now.", "Craig Huber", "And then I know it's hard to forecast this, but the transaction line within S&P Ratings, what is your thought? You have some forecast, obviously, internally on that for 2014, your EPS guidance. What are you sort of thinking right now?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, the guidance that we've been giving, which is the mid-single-digits for the entire growth, is similar to where we come out. It's a whole blend of what we see going on in the corporate markets. I mentioned earlier that there's a trend towards -- if you look at the last quarter and what we're seeing in January, corporate[ph] finance and sovereigns have been lower. You've seen higher European high yield and mid-markets going to the markets. So there's really a story that it's hard to tell for the whole year so far. But we do see covered bond issuance, RMBS, others that are motoring along pretty well. So that's why we're continuing at a blended basis to stick to the 0 to 6% for the entire portfolio.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Jack, can you give us any incremental color on your expectations for margins by segment in 2014? I'm asking specifically if we should anticipate the S&P Ratings business as relatively flat. And if so, where do the margin increases come from?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, Peter, I don't, at this point in time, for today at least, want to get overly precise on a business-by-business basis. That all being said, we are pointing to overall consolidated margin expansion across the portfolio of at least 100 basis points. And I will say that in each of the businesses, our expectation is that each business will contribute to that. And Ratings, just kind of given its size and magnitude, we are pointing to some sustained margin increase in that business. And we'll probably have a little bit more detail for you when we get together in March.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "And can you give us any quantification in terms of the savings associated with some of these initiatives you've taken recently and some of the incremental initiatives you plan for next year?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, as I mentioned earlier, some of the restructuring actions that we have taken in the fourth quarter here will -- should deliver approximately 2 points of all-in operating profit growth as we go into 2014. And some of the longer-term real estate actions that we've taken, we have some more work to do to really fully impact the full economic cost, but should add to lower our cost footprint as we go into '15 and '16 beyond.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "But does that mean that the corporate expense side, corporate overhead item could actually be down a little bit potentially in the out-years?", "John F. Callahan", "In the out-years. Right now, we will call it flat for next year. But it is a place where we'd look to continue to sustain some year-on-year reductions once we get past '14.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And last thing, any comment on the litigation costs and regulatory costs, whether that is an incremental expense in '14 or maybe that's a benefit to you in '14?", "John F. Callahan", "For right now, I would view both those costs as largely flat going into next year. That's been sort of our assumption overall going into '14.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And actually, one more last question, please. For Doug, just your thoughts on the competitive dynamics in the Ratings business. There's a lot of noise always about new players in the market. So anything interesting you're seeing from that perspective?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, as you see, the markets have continued to move around in terms of what are the different areas that are active right now. Clearly, in the U.S. Structured Finance markets, there's a very competitive market with some niche players that have started to gain traction. And so that's actually very quite welcome by the issuers and by regulators and others to see that competitive market. On a global scale, however, there's only a few truly global players. And around the world, we see other players coming into the market. But we do think that in addition to the competition keeping everybody on their toes and showing that they have high-quality analytics, it's also part of the opportunity set that people see out there as the capital markets actually increase. So the size of the markets overall, we expect in the longer run will continue to grow as you see bank disintermediation, you see infrastructure projects requiring longer-term capital, you see aging populations and the requirements that are put on governments to actually finance their health care programs, their social security programs, again infrastructure. We look at the long-term trends and feel that there is space for a robust analytical community, including ratings. And so we do see more competition, and we're up to that challenge and feel that it actually keeps everybody on their toes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I just want to first ask about Capital IQ. You talked about selling one new -- or having one new customer sign up for the new product. I guess, how does that compare to what you would expect? And I guess, how does that reflect the general reaction to clients to some of the new products you've been rolling out?", "John F. Callahan", "Obviously, it's still very, very early days. So we're still introducing the new product's capabilities to customers, so we're pleased to have one relationship in place. But we view it as very early days in an area where we're going to continue to build out throughout '14 and into next. So far, so good is how I think -- would be our point but a lot more work ahead of us.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "And there's a very robust pipeline of new products and services that have excellent analytical tools, as well as the interfaces are compelling. And these have a long lead time on sales. These are the types of products that we're working with sophisticated organizations and sophisticated buyers. So in addition to our development and beta testing, we're using that as an opportunity to get ahead of this long lead on the sales cycle. But this is clearly areas where we will be providing ongoing updates on the rollout and how these products are doing.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Given the sales cycle, is it more likely that it's '15 or '16 before you really see the growth rate of that segment improve from some of the new product rollouts, though? So I guess, can you see an impact for this year?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, I think it depends a little bit. I think in some of the areas, the investments, for example, what we're doing in terms of exchange level of latency information, I think we'll get some sustained growth as we go through this year. I think some of the Portfolio Risk products, a bit of growth this year but probably feather in more back in '15 and beyond. So I think it depends a little bit by which product line we're really focusing on right now.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then last question, just on Platts. So with some of the regulatory stuff that came up earlier this year, is there any developments or news on that front?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "There's no new news on that front, so nothing to report on Platts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Arthur with Evercore.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. Jack, on Exhibit 5, where you provide the adjustments, the non-GAAP adjustments by segment, you did not add back the impairment charge seemingly in the Indices business. So I guess, my question is, had you done that, are we talking about the $50 million going to $76 million adjusted in terms of op profit for Indices? And then what would the minority interest look like if that had flowed through? Or does the minority interest reflect that?", "John F. Callahan", "Let me first comment on why we did not call it out as an adjustment. We have taken an approach to be very pure or just be very clear about what we're going to call an adjustment to earnings. And it really related -- everything we have identified over the last few years has really been about what was necessary to separate McGraw Hill Financial from McGraw-Hill Education and/or a cost relative to driving productivity to basically restructure our cost structure. In this case, this is different. And therefore, we did not call it out as an adjustment to income. That all being said, we have isolated it, so each investor can view it as they would like. But you're exactly right, if that $26 million charge, that would be -- it could be added back, and that certainly is probably a better judge of the ongoing performance of the business. And if that had flowed all the way to the bottom line, that would have added about another $0.04 of earnings per share to the bottom line, because it would then -- we have the tax effect, the $26 million, and then it's our share of 73% of that posttax impact. So it's about $0.04.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Great. And that's very helpful. And then on the legal front, I mean, I'm curious on your comment about there's ongoing discovery with the DOJ case, because my understanding was that the hearing on the 11th in March was really to kind of come to an agreement on exactly the scope of the case from the government's point of view, which then would allow for a better definition in terms of discovery. But I didn't think you were really at the point where you knew what the scope of the case was. So I guess, the question is what are you hoping to accomplish at the March 11 meeting?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "I'm going to ask Ken Vittor to answer that question, since he can give us more precise details.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Thanks, Doug. Yes, there is a hearing on March 11. That hearing is addressing the motion to compel that we filed to compel the government to provide us with documents relating to 3 categories that relate to our defenses in the case. There are numerous other categories and other defenses, where the government has provided us and will be continuing to provide us with documents. So there is discovery going on, even as we speak, in those areas where the government has not resisted production of documents and where there are witnesses. So while the discovery goes on, there are these 3 categories of documents, which the government has objected to, which we have filed a motion to compel. At the March 11 hearing, the judge will hear our motion to compel, review the government's response to our motion to compel, and then either at the hearing or afterwards, will issue a ruling determining whether we will be given access to the documents, which so far have been denied to us. So there is discovery going on while we have the motion to compel on the 3 categories that have been objected to.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just to focus a little bit on the C&C businesses, clearly it seems like Platts continues its momentum and should grow in the double-digit, as it has been. But could you maybe help us understand some of the dynamics with J.D. Power and then the Construction asset as well, what your outlook is for those 2 businesses?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Let me start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Jack. J.D. Power is a business that has done a great job of focusing on core analytics and products which are delivering value to their customers on their -- one of the key ones is the Initial Quality survey. They also have another key product, PIN data. And as the auto market in the U.S., which is one of their large markets, has recovered, they've seen benefits from that. In addition, they have a very strong position in China, which is a very high-growth auto market. And the company has been diversifying into other essential consumer areas, such as bank products, insurance products, cell phones, et cetera. So J.D. Power has a broad platform of analytics for consumer experience. And they're growing and expanding and looking, in particular, at international opportunities. Construction has, over the last 3 years, done a fantastic job to reposition the business in light of a very difficult secular construction market and real estate -- U.S. commercial real estate market. They have repositioned the business and looked very carefully at their cost base, which they've managed incredibly tightly, and also repositioned towards new analytical and products which are allowing them to provide forward-looking information analytics and forecasts on the construction market. So they're able to start selling those products. The business is really starting back. As we mentioned earlier, they've had a quarter which was difficult. But compared to where they've been, it's definitely on the upswing. Let me ask Jack to give a few more comments on those.", "John F. Callahan", "Just on J.D. Power, I would just simply add that the year we had this year in 2013 was an all-time record year for J.D. Power. And we are continuing to benefit from not just good growth in North America, but also the very strong position we have across Asia Pacific, which is now about 30% of the business. And we do anticipate another record year in 2014 and sustained growth. On Construction, in terms of 2014, we do -- we are targeting sort of a transition year. We are looking for the business and we've seen this evidence, particularly as we've gone through the fourth quarter, that the business is turning the corner. And we are projecting modest growth for that business as we go into next year. And I think based -- building on Doug's comments, the team has done a fantastic job of really kind of changing the product. It's much more digital and analytic today than where it was many years ago. And we believe it's well positioned for, as it turns the corner, for growth moving forward.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just on the entire division just in terms of margins, I mean, it seems like for the last 3 quarters at least, you guys have ran around that 32% rate. Is that a good base to start off for what the full year should look like? And then obviously, the incremental revenue obviously should have high margins of the business. Is that a fair way to think about it?", "John F. Callahan", "I think if you were to kind of look at some projected modest growth off the full year margins of 2013, I think we can continue to show some modest improvement off this base.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then one last one for me, and maybe it sounds like we'll get a lot more of this color on the upcoming Investor Day. But you've highlighted before in Capital IQ, certain areas that you're looking to rationalize, divest, et cetera. I was just wondering if across the portfolio of McGraw Hill Financial, based on maybe Doug's initial strategic review, if there were any other sort of areas that you've highlighted that could potentially be in that camp, where it's not core to, I guess, the financial umbrella here?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, you're right. This is something we will talk more about in March. But the way I think of it right now is that, that's a lot less important than taking advantage of the portfolio of brands and products and capabilities and, in particular, the talent that we have to grow the business. And that will be our main focus. We'll talk about that along the way. Clearly, with any type of growth, you want to prune unnecessary activities or unnecessary businesses. But the core of what we've done, after the separation of the publishing and education business, is to really have a growth machine now that we will be looking at to employ across the globe with new products, with new product segments, with new markets. And that will be the main focus. But as you mentioned, along the way, there probably are capabilities and assets here and there that we'll need to prune.", "Operator", "We'll now take our final question from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I may have missed a portion of the call, so I apologize if you're repeating yourself. But I was first wondering, any color you can give on expectations for growth in the Indices business, given we may -- probably won't see what we saw again in 2013 in the index, but you could see some equity AUM benefit from a rising interest rate environment. And the second half of that would be any thoughts on new product development going forward relative to what you've done in the last couple of years?", "John F. Callahan", "I mean, look, Indices just had a fantastic year, fantastic year. I would say for right now, I mean, our outlook for Indices as we go into next year, it's probably very much in line with our overall company guidance of mid-single-digit revenue growth. But obviously, there's going to be some volatility based on capital flows in that. But that's sort of the going-in assumption for right now. And the team is always at work with our major customers, trying to develop new products. And that's just part of our everyday operation for right now.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And I guess, a similar question about Platts. I know you talked a bit about J.D. Power and Construction. How much of the growth should we expect to be from the core energy customer versus that you've made a lot of progress that you highlighted in the press release, from Metals & Agriculture and some of the other products? And how should we think about what's going on in the emerging markets and the ability to continue to push that outlook[ph] going forward?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Again, I think that you saw that in the progress that's already starting to come through on the numbers of diversification into Petrochemicals, into other metals and mining and energy, nonpetroleum energy. This is part of the growth model of Platts is to diversify into other commodity segments. And this is one of the opportunities that we will outline more fully in March, because it's a very exciting one as you see the need for transparency and benchmarks that can be used in a way that will help growth and investment around the globe. So we're very, very pleased with the progress that Platts has already made. They've got a proven track record now of diversifying away from just Petroleum. That doesn't mean that Petroleum isn't also a very high-growth field, given what's happening with frac-ing and nontraditional methods of extracting oil and gas around the globe. So there's a lot of activity in Petroleum and Petrochemicals and in metals and mining and other commodities that -- we're very excited about this opportunity.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call.

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. All participants are in a listen-only mode. We will open the conference to question-and-answer after the presentation and instructions will follow at that time.", "To access the webcast and slides, go to www.mhfi.com for [www.mcgraw-hill.com] and click on the link for the first quarter earnings webcast. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for McGraw Hill Financials. Sir, you may begin.", "Chip Merritt", "Thank you and good morning. Thanks all online for joining us for McGraw Hill Financial's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer, also joining us is Ken Vittor, our General Counsel.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our results. I trust you have all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's.", "This earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

Any investor who has who expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of McGraw Hill Financial's should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors and we will ask the question from the media to be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at 212-512-3151 subsequent to this call.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Doug Peterson", "Thanks, Chip, and good morning. It was great to have a chance to meet with many of you during our recent Investor Day, and we thank you for your participation and feedback on the event. Most of the key messages we delivered on Investor Day, are focused on creating growth and driving performance. Setting annual growth goals and maintain disciplined capital allocation, more actively managing businesses, completing our portfolio rationalization and driving productivity savings are all part of this focus.", "The year is off to a solid start, despite the decrease [reported] increases in both, revenue and earnings for the quarter. Platts and S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered double-digit revenue growth, driving the overall MHFI growth in the quarter. During Investor Day, we spoke about our global footprint and the opportunities we see for international growth and during the first quarter international revenue growth of 7% was more than twice that of domestic growth.", "During the quarter, we reported free cash flow $85 million and returned $246 million in dividends and share repurchases, which continues to demonstrate our commitment to returning capital to shareholders.", "If we look at the financial performance during the quarter, revenue increased 5% year-on-year and 6% from organic growth. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%. We achieved a 100-basis point improvement in the operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS increased 12%. The strength of our portfolio is clearly evident this quarter. Weak issuance hindered the growth at S&P rating services, but S&P Dow Jones Indices in commodities and commercial markets delivered double-digit operating profit increases. This chart shows how our non-ratings businesses comprised 48% of operating profit, up from 41% a year ago. S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts once only small parts of our portfolio have grown into major contributors.", "Now let me turn to the individual business segments, and I will start with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. During the quarter, revenue increased 1%, operating profit decreased 4% and the operating margin decreased 220 basis points to 42.2%. As is widely understood the marketplace bond issuance was erratic during the quarter, but overall it was weak.", "Bank loan ratings on the other hand continued to show considerable strength. The increase in expense is due to investments in human capital in areas of businesses where we are seeing increasing volumes as well as in data and technology. You will note that the methodology for allocating unallocated expenses has changed for every business unit and you will see that on the upcoming charts and Jack will discuss this in a moment.", "You will see on this next slide that non-transaction growth in the quarter, which in aggregate to 9% was driven by annual fees, which increased by 6%. In addition, Rating Evaluation Service revenue increased 33% as the Europe, Middle East; Africa region realized record revenue in this category due to increased merger and acquisition activity.", "Lastly strengthened CRISIL's Coalition analytical businesses also contributed. Transaction revenue from bond ratings and structured finance and corporate decreased as a result of lower bond issuance levels. Global bond issuance, including sovereigns, excluding on a par basis decreased 10%, however the number of issues was down 27%. Because of the tiered pricing associated with larger deals, our total revenue was negatively impacted bank loan ratings remained at bright spot, however with total revenue increasing 19%.", "Consistent with 2013 trends, international growth continued to outpace domestic activity. International revenue increased 6% driven by record high-yield issuance in Europe, influenced by bank disintermediation. In both, the United States and Europe, the first quarter will be the most difficult bond issuance comparison we faced all year.", "As you'll see in the graphics on this chart, during the quarter U.S. corporate and public finance issuance decreased 5% and 26%, respectively. Importantly, U.S. high yield issuance declined 38%. You will recall that in the first quarter of 2013, high-yield issuance was at a record level.", "Conversely in Europe, we saw record high-yield issuance which increased 29%. In fact, this is one of the few times in European high-yield issuance exceeded that of the U.S. While we are encouraged by the trends in Europe, structured finance issuance remains anemic. Fortunately, the problems of weak issuance and lack of liquidity and capital flows are starting to be noticed by regulators.", "In a six-page report published earlier this month, the European Central Bank and The Bank of England noted that regulation may be undermining Europe's economic recovery. In particular they are concerned about the shrinking market for asset-backed securities. The report cited the Standard & Poor's analysis, which shows the cumulative default rate on European structured finance assets between July 2007 and the third quarter last year was only 1.5%.", "Now, let me update you on developments on the litigation front. 36 cases have been dismissed outright. 13 dismissals by lower courts have been affirmed by higher courts and 11 cases had been voluntarily withdrawn. That leaves us with a couple of dozen non-government cases that remain outstanding.", "During the quarter, the company won a motion to dismiss with prejudice in the space Coast case, which followed the initial dismissal a year ago. As a result of this decision, Space Coast will not be able to re-file another amended complaint. Please note that the Space Coast is named by the government as one of the alleged victims in the Department of Justice case.", "Now on the DOJ case, on April 15th, the court granted S&P's discovery motion to compel the government to produce documents relating to the independent or objectivity of ratings a rating agencies, documents relating to the conduct of mortgage lenders, financial institutions and issuers of securities and documents relating to Standard & Poor's ratings services First Amendment Retaliation Defense, with certain limitations. This ruling will be very helpful to the company in its defense of the lawsuit. In the consolidated state cases, we are awaiting a ruling by the Federal District Court in New York, on the attorneys general motion to remand the cases back to the state. During the first quarter, no new cases were filed.", "With that, let me now move on to S&P Capital IQ, which delivered top line growth of 4% this quarter. Excluding the lost revenue from ongoing portfolio rationalization of several small products, including financial communication, Funds Management Research, Europe and ADF exchange, organic growth was approximately 6%. Operating profit increased year-over-year for the third straight quarter and the margin increased modestly. Another highlight of the quarter was the rollout had begun on Desktop capabilities, which I'll touch on in a moment.", "Now, let me review the three business segments within S&P Capital IQ. Capital IQ Desktop and enterprise solutions revenue increased 4%, principally driven by an 8% increase in S&P Capital IQ Desktop revenue. S&P Credit Solutions revenue increased 5%, driven by an 8% increase in ratings expressed.", "S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence revenue increased 2%, driven by a 26% increase in leveraged commentary and data, which is known as LCD. LCD is a preeminent provider of leverage finance news and analysis. The increase was largely offset by shutting down its FMR in Europe in fourth quarter of '13.", "During Investor Day, Lou Eccleston discussed five new capabilities we're building for the S&P Capital IQ Desktop in 2014. Credit analytics was the first of these to launch. With these tools, users can measure, monitor and manage the credit risk of companies in mature and developing economies, with daily updated credit risk metrics.", "The new analytic models and workflow tools combined seamlessly with S&P Capital IQ leading fundamental data and research addressing needs of credit and financial professionals.", "Now return to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The business delivered another outstanding quarter with an 18% increase in revenue and a 43% increase in operating profit. This growth was primarily driven by increased licensing fees from ETF customers. From exchanges, based on increased derivative trading volume approximately one-half of the revenue growth, however, due to refinement of our revenue recognition for certain products, which Jack will explain shortly.", "Our licensing agreement for the UBS commodities indices expires in June and the contract was not renewed. We will lose the revenue that was associated with this product. We expect our recent action with the S&P GSCI index license will largely offset the impact on profits.", "Quarter ending AUMs increased 27% to $667 billion from the end of the first quarter 2013. Importantly, 11% of the increase was the result of the inflows. Contributing to the strong quarter was an increase in licensing revenue from derivative trading. This was primarily due to SPX in fixed trading volumes, which increased 9% and 24%, respectively. In addition, our relationship with the CME proved beneficial with an 11% increase in the daily volumes on the CME equity complex.", "We believe that growth prospects for S&P Dow Jones Indices remain very strong and we continue to make strategic investments such as the following. We acquired the remaining intellectual property for the S&P global broad market index or the BMI. This is a comprehensive rules-based index. It's designed to measure global stock market performance. The index covers all publicly listed equities with flow-adjusted market values of $100 million and current leaks includes more than 10,500 constituents.", "We also began collaboration with the Korea Exchange for global marketing and sales of KRX Indices. We will leverage S&P Dow Jones Indices' proven experience in sales and marketing to license and further promote the KRX Indices to overseas investors in markets like U.S., Europe and Hong Kong. This includes the cost KOSPI 200, the premier gauge of equity market performance in South Korea. This agreement also paves a way to develop new Indices and share knowledge.", "Also, we announced a strategic index development and co-branding agreement with the Taiwan Stock Exchange, along with the launch of the S&P TWSE Taiwan low-volatility high-dividend Index. As more investors look to Taiwan, S&P Dow Jones Indices agreement with the Taiwan Stock Exchange will be a momentous step in creating diversified market indices, starting with Taiwanese equities. This agreement is a further sign of our commitment to Asia and to facilitating access to equity market intelligence in the region.", "One final note on S&P Dow Jones Indices, on January 24th, we announced along with the CBOE, the successful conclusion of the longstanding ISE Index Litigation. This litigation demonstrates our results in defending our legal rights.", "With that, now let me turn to commodities and commercial markets. Revenue grew 6% in the quarter, but excluding the impact of the sale of Aviation Week, organic revenue actually increased 10%. Platts and J.D. Power, both delivered double-digit revenue growth which was partially offset by softness in McGraw Hill Construction.", "Overall operating profit increased 27% resulting in a 510-basis point improvement in margin to 30.4%. As you can see in commodities, Platts is off to a great start for the year, delivering a 14% increase in revenue for the quarter.", "Petroleum, metals and agriculture, and Petrochemicals, all delivered double-digit revenue growth, while power and gas delivered mid single-digit growth. Due to its size, petroleum continued to provide the greatest absolute growth, while metals and ag, building on recent investments, provided the greatest growth rate which was 36%.", "I would like to share an example with you of how McGraw Hill Financial businesses create value across the platform and deliver essential intelligence. Historically, S&P Capital IQ has worked with S&P Ratings to deliver the annual S&P Capital IQ Energy Symposium. This is the first year that Platts and S&P Dow Jones Indices also joined to sponsor and provide speakers for the event. S&P Capital IQ used this event to announce the launch of its new oil and gas estimates, including average and total daily production of oil, gas and natural gas liquids. The team together demonstrated the usefulness of this information.", "Furthermore, in commercial markets, revenue decreased 3%. Excluding the sale of Aviation Week, however, organic growth increased 5% in the quarter. J.D. Power achieved double-digit revenue growth, led by the auto business and customer advertising. China continues to significantly contribute to growth in the auto business. Another bright spot is customer advertising, which increased 34%, primarily from the initial quality study in autos in several non-auto studies. As we announced last month, we're exploring strategic alternatives for McGraw Hill Construction, but don't have any updates at this time.", "Summing up, we're off to a solid start for 2014, and our guidance remains unchanged. After Investor Day, I hope you have all had a great appreciation for the quality of our businesses, which was particularly demonstrated by the strength of S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts offsetting weak bond issuance that has been impacted Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.", "I want to thank all of you for joining call this morning and now I am going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. Thank you.", "Jack Callahan", "Thank you, Doug. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call. This morning, I want to briefly discuss several items related to first-quarter performance. First, I want to recap key consolidated financial results in the quarter. Second, I will review some accounting related changes. Third, I will provide updates on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. Finally, I will review our guidance.", "In the first quarter, revenue grew 5% with organic revenue growing approximately a point faster, excluding the impact of Aviation Week as well as the sales of Financial Communications and small product line closures at S&P Capital IQ.", "Segment operating profit grew 9%, driven by the strong results in commodities and commercial markets in S&P Dow Jones Indices. In addition, after cycling through a period of stepped-up investments, S&P Capital IQ has delivered adjusted profit growth in each of the last three quarters.", "Adjusted unallocated expense increased by $6 million, primarily due to an increase in unoccupied office space resulting from recent divestitures as well as the tiny of certain professional fees. In addition, the first quarter is the most challenging comparison of the year for this particular expense item.", "In line with our previous guidance, the tax rate was 34% in the quarter, a decrease of 100 basis points versus the first quarter a year ago. Our adjusted net income increased 9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.89. There was a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 7 million shares versus the year ago period.", "While there were no adjustments to GAAP results this quarter, there were two accounting-related changes that are noteworthy. The first has to do with unallocated expenses. As part of the transformation to McGraw Hill Financial, a comprehensive review of accounting and reporting practices and policies was undertaken. As a result, beginning in 2014, all shared operating services will be fully allocated to the segments utilizing a methodology that more closely aligns with each segment's usage of these services.", "The cost that remain in unallocated expense will be largely corporate center costs, select initiatives in excess real estate. We included Exhibit 8 in the press release schedules to provide a recast of operating profit by quarter for 2013. For 2013 in total, approximately $75 million of these costs have been reallocated to the segments.", "The second has to do with refining revenue recognition for certain products. The primary example was for a subset of ETF licensees within S&P Dow Jones Indices. We have incorporated validated data that provides assets under management for a greater portion of ETFs than we have historically had. Therefore, with this new data in history, we can now record revenue when earned. Approximately two-thirds of the ETF related revenues are already on this methodology. We expect this to be the only quarter meaningfully impacted by this change in revenue recognition.", "We continue to maintain an exceptionally strong balance sheet. As of the end of the quarter, we had $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents of which just under 40% was domestic cash. We continue to have approximately $800 million of long-term debt. Going forward, the strong balance sheet positions us to continue to make investments that strengthen the portfolio and adds appropriated sustainer share repurchase program.", "Our free cash flow during the quarter was $85 million versus negative cash flow $86 million a year ago. The improvement was primarily due to the timing of tax payments. It should also be noted that the first quarter free cash flow is generally going to be our lowest quarter each year as annual incentive compensation payments are made during this quarter. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in 2014.", "Now, let me update you on a return of capital activity. During the first quarter, approximately 2.2 million shares were repurchased at an average price of $78.47 per share. That leaves 47.8 million shares available from December's new authorization. We do anticipate selectively continuing repurchase activity in 2014, subject to market conditions. Despite these share repurchases, basic shares outstanding increased modestly from the end of 2013 for two reasons.", "First, $2.3 million employee stock options were exercised during the quarter. Over the last two years, employees have exercised significantly more stock options that have been granted. In fact, at the end of 2011, there were approximately 27 million outstanding stock options. At the end of the first quarter, there were less than 10 million.", "Second, each year in the first quarter restricted stock plans vest. This quarter 1.7 million shares of stock were issued associated with the 2011 performance stock plan. With this behind us and less stock options available for exercise, we expect share repurchases over the remainder of the year to have more impact on reducing shares outstanding.", "Now, I would like to reiterate our 2014 guidance. There has been no changes. We continue to target mid-single digit revenue growth in 2014. As a reminder, the impact of the divestiture of the Aviation Week, the sale of Financial Communications and the shutdown of several smaller product lines that S&P Capital IQ, reduces our year-on-year growth rate by approximately 1 point.", "We are targeting flat unallocated expense and sustained margin expansion with at least a 100-basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. We believe that the effective tax rate achieved in 2013 is sustainable and we are targeting a 34% tax rate in 2014. On the bottom line, the adjusted, diluted earnings per share guidance is $3.75 to $3.85 per share.", "From a cash perspective, we anticipate investing approximately $125 million in capital expenditures and approaching $1 billion in free cash flow. In closing, we anticipate delivering continued growth in 2014 as long-term secular drivers of growth combined with our leading market positions of brands remain in place.", "That said, market volatility could impact results as issue trends in Q1 demonstrate. Over the balance of the year, we do anticipate a step up in performance, especially in the second half. Again, thank you for joining us today on the call and let me turn it back over to Chip Merritt.", "Chip Merritt", "Thanks, Jack. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants, (Operator Instructions) Operator, we will now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", " ", "Thank you. This question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just to touch on the rating side first, in terms of the incremental expenses you are putting in for headcount and technology and so forth, I was just curious, how much longer through the quarter should we see that flowing through the number like when does margin start showing that that year-over-year improvement is I guess where I am getting to.", "Jack Callahan", "Expense growth was mid-single digit in the ratings business, in the first quarter, we are not anticipating some big significant step ups as we go through the year. I think the margin expansion will be based in part what we see in terms of perhaps improved issuance trends over the balance of the year, combined with our ongoing cost reduction programs, but we continue to expect some reasonable sustained margin in this business going forward.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays", "Okay. Then in terms of the structured finance performance, I was curious if you could comment a little bit more on the dynamics there I think. Was it more a case of have the comps or share losses just because your competitor obviously cited a slightly better results in their structured finance line.", "Doug Peterson", "This is Doug. It's a combination of both. As you know, the structured finance market overall globally was down a lot. The global decrease in structured finance issuance was actually 13% in number of issues and 9% in terms of par volume and billions of dollars and that was even down further in the United States. It was down by almost 12% in dollar volume in the U.S. and 23% in terms of number of issues, so there was a significant decrease.", "The European structured finance markets, as I said earlier, remained completely anemic, with the exception of covered bonds and the covered bond issuance is a pretty standardized ongoing set of issuance so we saw a combination of very weak structured finance market.", "Our market share has fluctuated depending on what kind of asset class you are talking about. Recently, we have not been at as high of a market share in CMBS, but in other asset classes we are continuing with the traditional market shares we have had.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays", "Okay. That's helpful. Just one last housekeeping, Jack, in terms of the flat guidance for unallocated expense. Can you just clarify what that 2013 numbers should be that we should model as flat?", "Jack Callahan", "\u2026you will see it detailed in Exhibit 8 of the appendix. On a full-year basic, it's $129 million.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays", "All right. Okay. Thank you guys.", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Alex Kramm - UBS", "Good morning. Maybe just coming back to the guidance, obviously remains pretty unchanged here. Maybe I missed it, but the bigger picture of what are the levers up, down relative to a quarter ago where you feel strong or weaker, what businesses do you think are running ahead and where do you see areas of maybe a little bit of concerned where you would - weaker than before.", "Doug Peterson", "Let me start just from a strategic point of view, we are very pleased with the new management team we have in place, our approach to how we are managing the business in allocating capital. A lot of our investments that we have been making in last couple of years have turned out to be the right one, so each business has its own opportunities for growth whether it's new asset classes, new products, customer penetration as well as expansion into international markets, so those are the ways that we are driving the performance and looking at where we put more emphasis and more growth.", "Clearly, were subject to, in many of our businesses to market volatility that we can't control, but what we can control which is our exposure on where we place our resources and where we are focusing our growth as well as how we manage our margins and manage our expenses, we are doing all we can to control where we can position ourselves for growth and margins, but obviously we do have some market volatility, we always have to live with.", "Jack Callahan", "Maybe I'll comment on Doug's comments, just back to guidance assumptions, I would tell you across our all the business I think are very much in line with our ingoing assumptions with maybe the possible exception of the slow start that we saw on our bond issuance within rate. Balance of that I think we feel pretty much in line and I think we will be monitoring that obviously over the balance of the year and much more stable now than it was at the start of the year.", "Alex Kramm - UBS", "Okay. Great. Then maybe just to dig in a little bit on the rating side again, one of the things I think that continues to stand out is the non-transaction fees and 9% growth this year I mean that's almost like fantastic number. That's recurring right? What are the levers that can drive this up or down we think over the next couple of years and is this a sustainable growth rate or could this accelerate through whatever you are seeing out there or what are the reasons that could slow this down to maybe something like the mid-single digits.", "Jack Callahan", "Well, there are various aspects of this that drove it during the quarter. If you recall, there was a lot of M&A activity in Europe, so our of Rating Evaluation Services are one of those areas which was quite attractive for the markets during the quarter. We have seen over time 9%, 7%. We have seen steady growth in this area. It hasn't been always as robust as the 9%, but over the last four quarters it's been over 6% every quarter. It has averaged over 7%, so we think it's a combination of shifts in capital markets that kind of work that a financial institution and corporates need to look at their ongoing long-term capital raising.", "Also, as large issuers around the globe, especially in Europe and other markets become much more frequent issuers, they shift from a transaction model to a non-transaction model, so there are a lot of secular trends which help us on this, but obviously we are not going to project out that it's always going to be 9%.", "Chip Merritt", "Alex, one thing I will add. This is Chip. If you look at the strength we've had in issuance over the last couple of years that then leads to better surveillance numbers in the years that follow.", "Alex Kramm - UBS", "Yes. Very helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Hi, there. This is Flavio. I am standing in for Hamzah today. How are you guys.", "Doug Peterson", "Good.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Just a quick question, first on the indices business, assuming that there is big margin expansion, a big part of is due to the revenue recognition issue and that's falling at a incremental margin. Can you help us understand how the margins will look like without that change?", "Doug Peterson", "One, obviously, we benefited from that one-time catch up in the revenue recognition, but this is as we mentioned this is partly the only quarter where we will have that impact. If you were just to back out basically half the revenue from this quarter\u2026", "Jack Callahan", "The half of revenue increase.", "Doug Peterson", "The half revenue increase, so that would give you a better judge of what more run rate may look like going forward.", "Jack Callahan", "Then take the operating profit as well. I did the calculation the other day. It was just a few percentage related to that. 3% is the difference.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "That's very helpful. You guys talked about the structured finance a little bit. I just wanted a little, if you could a little more color on the commercial gas market. That market has been getting some strength recently and are you guys seeing that and how do you think your position is within that specific market?", "Doug Peterson", "You are talking about the CMBS market?", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Yes.", "Doug Peterson", "Actually the CMBS market has been next. The strength has been in the last few weeks, but in the quarter it was a down 15%, actually 15.8% in terms of the par value of dollars and number of issuers were down almost 12%.", "The market has been quite volatile. There is a very different quality of properties coming into the CMBS market, so there's a lot more variability into what the asset class is and what type of assets are in it, whether it's higher-quality properties, lower quality property. How diversified the portfolios are, so we have a very competitive criteria which is understood by the markets. It's a competitive market, we have very good team there and it's one that is as you can see from the new entrance into the market and the rating agencies it is a very competitive part of the market, but we are very well positioned and we have been capturing some of the volumes and it's an area that we have a major focus on.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That's very helpful guys. That's all I had. Thank for taking my questions.", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. Good morning. First, I wanted to dig into the margins a little more detail, I know but not touched on Ratings margins, but I was wondering if you could spend a bit of time adjusting how you think the margins for some of the other businesses may progress through the year, particularly Capital IQ, then commodities and commercials given the investments you are make in growth.", "Doug Peterson", "Andre, we are trying to avoid get too detailed into specific margin expansion by business. We are trying to manage a portfolio here. That all being said, if I comment on some of the dynamics for the specific businesses in addition to earlier comments on Ratings.", "I think in Capital IQ, I think you have seen now over a couple quarters that were largely cycling through those investments and we are going to look to kind of sustained some margin expansion going forward, particularly as we gain the benefits and we are quite encouraged by some of the early indications some of the new functionality and products that are coming into the marketplace.", "Across commodities and commercial you know we have had stellar margin expansion in those businesses over the last few quarters. I would think we look to have some continued may be modest expansion there, but our primary focus there is really driving the top line growth of Platts J.D. Power, which are both double-digit right now so our focus there is growth.", "Jack Callahan", "Let me just add that one of the things that we want to make sure that you follow carefully throughout the year is a year-on-year comparisons in what we call an organic. Since it sounds strange to talk about organic growth and you see margins going up from there, but we exited lower margin or slow growth businesses or underperforming businesses and so one of the other aspects of our margin expansion is going to be as we look at comparisons of our operating businesses without those slower growth and slower driver businesses that are included, so that's part of the business was reconditioning the portfolio and rationalizing it towards businesses want to invest in.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. I guess, one more housekeeping question on the litigation. I know you mentioned that Analyst Day, I believe you said the judge was pushing for both sides in the DOJ cases to come to trial by September 2015. That's honestly a moving target, but could you remind us what some of the next key milestones are whether there are any tangential channels like the one you mentioned this morning that could have some read across in the meantime.", "Doug Peterson", "Ken Vittor is here with us to answer that question.", "Ken Vittor", "Yes. There is no scheduled trial date. The judge has asked the parties to submit and we have a joint statement as to what would be an acceptable trial date and subject to certain caveats. The parties have indicated in September 2015 trial date, but the judge has not ordered that. There is no scheduling order yet as to a specific trial date.", "In terms of the next date to be looking at, the judge has a hearing in May on May 27th, where he will resolve issues relating to the process by which privilege issues associated with the documents that he has ordered to be produced to S&P in response to our motion to compel, how that will be handled either through a special master or magistrate, so that will be the next hearing in the case.", "In terms of this Space Coast case, which your referencing that is a very helpful ruling in granting our motion to dismiss, the court issued a ruling which said that it's not enough to claim that they were generalized concerns about rating agencies or the business model, but issuer paved model that you have to tie whatever your generalized concerns are about rating agencies to the specific CDOs that the plaintiffs claim they lost money on. That failure to alleged with specificity led to the second dismissal in the Space Coast case and we will be using that precedent in the DOJ case and other cases, because there is a similar defect in many of the complaints filed against S&P in that they have generalized concerns about how the rating agencies operated during the financial crisis, but they don't tie them to the specific CDOs that are at issue either in the DOJ case or the other case, so we think that's a very helpful precedent for us.", "Chip Merritt", "Operator?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Capital Markets. You may ask your question.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Hi. I wanted to understand what is built into guidance at this point from a bond issuance perspective for the remainder of the year and how do you think about the trajectory of the business? What are your thoughts behind that?", "Doug Peterson", "I think, we are still going to have, while we are seeing a step in issuance. Certainly saw that in March, continuing into April. You know, there is very difficult comp on issuance in the second quarters, so that's going to be a tough comparison, but then I think again in the third and fourth quarter, we anticipating some solid growth and that's in part point to strong performance.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Okay. Then I think, earlier you had talked about margins being up in all businesses this year. I might heard that incorrect, but I think you had mentioned that maybe on your last call. How should we think about the margin profiles of different businesses? It is more of a portfolio effect this year? Has that changed it all?", "Doug Peterson", "Well, I mean, I think what we are trying to point to is, overall our guidance is assuming at least a one point margin improvement overall across the entirety of our businesses. I think that's been sort of the guidance that we have given. All being said, there building on our comments earlier in both ratings and capitals and commodities and Cap IQ, we do think we should have some sustained margin improvement as we cycle through the/the year.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Jack Callahan", "If you look at the first quarter, I mean, we had margin improvement in all the businesses with the exceptional of the Ratings business and that's understandable with issuance environment, so with a better issuance environment you could see margin improvement there.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "Sure. Then just fully understand the accounting change, any impact to guidance from that change on an annual basis and does that offset the businesses that were shut down? I think, you said there was 1% impact from those businesses being shutdown.", "Jack Callahan", "There is no change in guidance, because this accounting change was fully considered in both, our financial plans and in our initial guidance, so there's no impact to where we were a quarter ago.", "Joseph Foresi - Janney Capital Markets", "All right. Thank you.", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you.", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray", "Thanks. Jack, I want to make sure I fully understand the change the next index business in the first quarter. Should we assume that the incremental revenue you got from the change basically all flows through to operating income?", "Jack Callahan", "Yes. Largely it does, but just remember that from a bottom line point of view on 73%, it's the EPS, so it has about $0.02 EPS impact on the quarter.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. What you think the right run rate for operating margins within the index businesses is on a sustainable basis?", "Jack Callahan", "I think we are approaching 60, right? Maybe did better, but one of the things we are benefiting from here is that we had picked up you know, Doug's comments, we picked up some additional licensees that are also benefiting the portfolio, so I think we are in an obviously at a very enviable position in that business.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray", "Got it. Could I ask just two other things? One, Jack, can you talk a little bit about how you are thinking about the timing of repurchase activity over the balance of the year? Then secondly, any color on traction in terms of new asset classes in the Platts business. Thanks.", "Jack Callahan", "In terms of share repurchase, we are going to stay flexible on that one. As you saw, we were pretty active in Q1 and that we have a lot of flexibility relative to our authorization, so we will update the market as we go through quarter-by-quarter.", "Doug Peterson", "On Platts, we are looking at expanding. If you think about the Platts business, it's got a large concentration in petroleum and petrochemicals, fair related to that so we are seeing a lot of interest in getting more transparency in the market using more benchmarks as these markets become more global and there more complexity, more information floating around large stake on what happens with countries and companies et cetera. so we are looking at expanding into further expansion to metals, ag, power and gas, so we're going to be looking at organic, inorganic opportunities, but specifically we have a lot of interest in growing in the other, diversifying into other types of commodities just petroleum.", "Chip Merritt", "Operator?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Arthur with Evercore. You may ask your question.", "Doug Arthur - Evercore", "Yes. Two follow-ups. On the loss of the UBS commodity business, is a is that - I mean, obviously that's built in the guidance and your general sense is that other products will, that are coming on strong are going to kind of nullify the impact of revenues. Is that a fair assessment?", "Doug Peterson", "I think, a fair assessment from a profit point of you. There could be a little bit of revenue impact more in the back half of this year and going into the first part of next, but from a bottom line point of view I think we have it offset.", "Doug Arthur - Evercore", "Okay. Then just as follow-up with Ken on the line. Ken, what is your sort of timeline expectations in the Calpers' case through the end of '015 at this point? I know there has been a lot of back and forth.", "Ken Vittor", "Yes. It re-appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss or logging was held and the appeal was pending, so the timing will depend on when the Court of Appeals issues a ruling on our appeal of the motion to dismiss.", "Doug Arthur - Evercore", "That was based on a flat?", "Ken Vittor", "Yes. Exactly.", "Ken Vittor", "Our argument in the motion is that in order to have a negligent misrepresentation claim in California, it has to relate to a past or present fact and we argue that the court below got it wrong by treating an opinion as a fact when all of the courts across the country have treated ratings uniformly as opinions, future looking opinions, forward-looking opinions, so our argument is there can be negligent misrepresentation claim by Calpers because the predicate is missing. There is no present or past fact that has been misrepresented when you have a ratings opinion.", "Doug Arthur - Evercore", "Any expectation on timing of the ruling?", "Jack Callahan", "No. It's totally subject to the court's calendar.", "Doug Arthur - Evercore", "Okay.", "Ken Vittor", "I think as I said the oral argument was held the case is pending.", "Doug Arthur - Evercore", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. You may ask your question.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "Hi, guys. Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, but two quick ones I guess. One on the UBS commodity contract, I know you said it's not much of an impact to profits, but more so to revenue. Can you size that at all for us, I guess, more or so for the second half of the year in terms of what to expect?", "Jack Callahan", "We would try and stay with the overly explicated about our existing contracts, but let's just call it a couple of points above revenue growth, but very manageable.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "That's a couple of points to that business or to the overall business?", "Jack Callahan", "Just to that business.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "Okay. Then within Capital IQ, you talked about Desktop growing 8%, but I guess even your Desktop and Enterprise Solutions only grew 4. I guess, what's offsetting that and can we see anything I guess that overall part of the business creep up towards that high single-digit growth rate that you described just for the Desktop part of the business.", "There is a set of different products that we have under this and see Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions and we have got portfolio risk, we have got [compu] stat in there we have we've got consolidated feed. We are investing in that business and recently we acquired a business in Europe called QuantHouse we are doing investment in there and we think those will be obviously paying off at some point in the future, but what's really important for us right now is to drive the Desktop growth.", "This is critical, because it gets our key product into people's offices and we are investing in the new capability in the desktop which we think are very clearly targeted at the needs of credit analysts and portfolio analysts and others, so there that this will help us drive our growth in the future, but that's one of the reasons we wanted to highlights 8% specifically in Desktop.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "How would that 8% compared to last year though couple of years. I can't recall if you have broken it out in that much detail.", "Jack Callahan", "Well, we haven't broken it by much detail, but I mean, the Desktop business has been growing kind of 5%, 6%, 7-ish percent for the last couple years. We have been pretty pleased and we will talk about this that our Desktop business is certainly gaining share. Let's put it that way.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "The growth this quarter it's basically a continuation of the trend or did the growth pick up is what I was trying to understand.", "Jack Callahan", "Yes. I mean, we don't really quibble over 1% or 2%, so.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Jack Callahan", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may ask your question.", "Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners", "", "Yes. Good morning. Just can you talk a little bit further about your outlook here for the transaction-based revenues within ratings? The second quarter you alluded to how tough year-over-year comp is there, but are you expecting that to be flat to down in the second quarter. Just curious with your backlogs are you seeing in the next couple of months.", "Doug Peterson", "I think our guidance can manage to exactly what you said, flat to modestly down. Then over the balance of the year we do in part driven by much, much some easier comps, particularly in third quarter. We would see return to solid growth in the back half of the year.", "Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners", "", "Also you guys have been very good on the rationalize your portfolio in recent years. I am just curious if you think there is much left to go on that front going forward, besides what you have already announced on the construction side.", "Jack Callahan", "I think Construction is the most significant. There might be a few small products here and there, but nothing that I would imagine significant.", "Doug Peterson", "Our focus right now, Craig, is more below we can do to build the portfolio and add to growth.", "Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners", "", "Shifting to the unallocated expenses back down to the operating units, I am just curious will that change the mindset at all with your managers of the various business units to be more cognizant of those expenses or are they already very well contained - already embedded in what their metrics are based on the compensation every year.", "Jack Callahan", "Well put, Craig. No, I think one of the part of this change is to have more visibility, more alignment on the total cost of doing business, so yes I do anticipate that collectively we will have a lot more focus on what we can do to manage these shared costs and make them a contributor to ongoing margin enhancement going forward, so I think some real benefits of having everyone working out the same set of numbers.", "Doug Peterson", "What I would say that you answered your own question in question.", "Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners", "", "With that, I do have one more quick question please.", "Doug Peterson", "Do have an answer for it?", "Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners", "", "Your share buybacks at 2.2 million shares you guys bought back, is the DOJ case in your minds holding you back from picking up the shore buybacks meaningfully from these levels?", "No. Look, I think as we said before, I think we have an extraordinarily flexible and strong balance sheet I think that gives us a lot of flexibility going forward, so it maybe a consideration in the sense that we want reserves of flexibility, but I think we have adequate flexibility to have a lot of choices via the either share repurchase and/or addition to the portfolio.", "Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners", "", "Thank you.", "Doug Peterson", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo Securities. You may have ask your question.", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "Good morning, everyone.", "Doug Peterson", "Good morning.", "Jack Callahan", "Hi, Bill.", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "One question for you, follow-up on the S&P Dow Jones Indices, with 80% year-over-year growth in Q1, you had mentioned that half of that growth is from the revenue recognition. Just wanted to ask about how we should think about the growth rate for that division going forward, high single-digit, low double-digit or what should we think about it?", "Jack Callahan", "It's kind of highly dependent on what's going on with what your view of the market is going forward, because it's so based on capital that flows particularly into ETFs and mutual funds, can be also impacted by volatility, so it's hard to kind of point to a steady state sort of growth rate going forward.", "You know right now I think for the first half of the year growth probably is in the similar to what we saw on Q1 less the impact of the accounting change and maybe not quite as strong in the second half, because of the modest impact of some of the loss on revenue on UBS. Then I think you get overlay what your view of the equity markets going forward.", "Doug Peterson", "I would add though that clearly, we have this impact from markets that Jack mentioned, but on the other hand we are investing for growth in markets like Korea and Taiwan. Last quarter, we invested in Mexico and Colombia. We bought out the BMI and GSCI, so we are investing in areas of the markets where we think there will be growth like the emerging markets like Asia, so we don't want to have a one trick pony and just be dominant by the S&P 500.", "We want to take advantage of that brand and the expertise in the platform that we have, add more product and more capacity into it, so you should be hearing from us over time a lot of these types of partnerships and investments, which also are going to help drive growth.", "They might not drive growth next quarter or the quarter after that. It might take a while to see the growth coming through, but we think with the type of globalization markets we want to be using that is also a place where we play.", "Jack Callahan", "If I can add just one last thing, with ETFs being the dominant portion of that business, even in a flat market environment your are still seeing inflows in the Platts investing and about 12% of the increase in AUM came from Inflows, so we think that trend will continue.", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "Continuing on that theme, there has been talk about in index property potentially on the block and I wanted to ask about your thoughts about M&A opportunity in that business. We don't comment on speculation or things that are being discussed in the market.", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Then one housekeeping question. Just if you happen to have the fully diluted shares outstanding exiting the quarter - taking into account the buyback?", "Jack Callahan", "I think it's 277.", "Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities", "277? All right. Thank you very much.", "Jack Callahan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from Ed Atorino with Benchmark.", "Ed Atorino - Benchmark", "Hi. Thank you. You mentioned CMBS down 13%. Any other big categories you would like to highlight as either up or down in the ratings in the quarter?", "Jack Callahan", "Well, from the point of view of the market issuance overall, the quarter as I said earlier was a choppy quarter. It began with incredibly low issuance in January and February. There was a lot of discussions about what happening with the Fed, with tapering with interest rate movements et cetera, so the first two months of the quarter were very slow.", "March was picked up the pace and there was a lot more issuance, so when you look across all of the asset classes, generally speaking they were down - for total worldwide issuance was down, in terms of number of issues was down 25% and in par value it was down 4%.", "As I mentioned earlier, that also impacted some of our earnings, because some of the deals were so large. Structured finance was down 9.4% in the par value and down 13.1% on number of issuance globally, so you start looking at market-by-market. Generally speaking, the first quarter, there was a lot of volatility.", "Chip could provide you more details on them market-by-market offline on that.", "Ed Atorino - Benchmark", "Okay. Second question, I'll need to be a wise guy. You are buying in a lot of shares then you issue a lot of shares. Is there a strategy there? I mean, it sounds like it just spins the wheels.", "Ed Atorino - Benchmark", "Well, I mean, there are two different things, right? Buying back shares is the allocation of capital and in terms of the choices that we have, the issuance of shares has all do with compensation and I would think it's appropriate particularly for a company like ours which is made up of relatively higher paid executives to have some of their incentive compensation based in equity related vehicles such that we have aligned interests between large value creation and that of our shareholders.", "Jack Callahan", "If you look over time, you can see a steady decrease of our shares outstanding.", "Ed Atorino - Benchmark", "That's true. It is a net decline. Thanks.", "Ken Vittor", "You have particular quarters [first] quarter where your are rolling out more compensation, so you have the offset and that's what we kind of highlighted that one of the Jack's slides.", "Ed Atorino - Benchmark", "Terrific. Thanks much.", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you. All right. That includes the call, so would like to thank you for joining us and we will talk to you in future. Thanks.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenters' slides is available now for download from www.mhfi.com. A replay of this call, including the Q&A session will be available in about two hours.

That's MHFI for McGraw Hill Financial, Inc., dot-com, and click on the link for the second quarter earnings webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for McGraw Hill Financial. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us for McGraw Hill Financial's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer; and also joining us for his final earnings call, Ken Vittor, our General Counsel. This morning, we issued a news release with our results. I trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we'll provide an adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "I would also like to call your attention to a recent European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of McGraw Hill Financial should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially, the company. We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at our New York office at (212) 512-3151 subsequent to this call.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Thanks, Chip, and good morning, and welcome to the call. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth. Revenue growth was led by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and J.D. Power, each with double-digit growth. Platts, S&P Capital IQ and S&P Dow Jones Indices all contributed high single-digit revenue growth. During the first quarter of the year, Platts and S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered double-digit revenue growth, driving the overall MHFI results in that quarter. All of this speaks to the strength of the businesses we have in our portfolio.", "For this quarter, adjusted diluted EPS increased 15% to $1.06. And as you can see, based on this strong year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, the company is raising its diluted adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $3.80 to $3.90. Year-to-date, the company reported free cash flow of $392 million and returned $525 million in dividends and share repurchases. This continues to demonstrate our commitment to returning capital to shareholders.", "If we look at the financial performance in more detail, revenue increased 8% year-on-year and 9% from organic growth. Adjusted operating profit increased 9%. We achieved a 40 basis point improvement in the operating margin. And what was most impressive about these results is that despite facing the most difficult earnings comparison of the year, second quarter diluted adjusted EPS increased 15%.", "Our global footprint continues to expand as international revenue growth of 10% continued to outpace domestic growth of 6%. In this chart, you can see that 3 of our businesses delivered double-digit international revenue growth. Note that excluding the impact from the sale of Aviation Week, Commercial Markets delivered double-digit international growth as well.", "Now I'd like to highlight that during the quarter, we announced a couple of key management changes. First of all, I'd like to thank Ken Vittor, who's here in the room with us, for his 33 years of dedicated service to the company. Ken's leadership and sound advice have been instrumental in guiding the company. Most of you will remember Ken for his clear explanations of complex legal issues on these quarterly earning conference calls. Thank you, Ken.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Thank you, Doug.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "And we all wish you the best in your retirement. And we're pleased that you will be here supporting us until the end of the year when you officially retire. Ken's replacement will be Lucy Fato, who starts next week. Lucy has extensive legal experience, serving most recently as Deputy General Counsel for a premier global professional services firm. And before that, she was a partner in the capital markets group at a global law firm.", "The other management change has been at S&P Capital IQ. Lou Eccleston is moving on to pursue other opportunities. Lou has made significant contributions to the business since joining the company in 2009. And I want to thank Lou and wish him every success in the future. A search is underway for Lou's replacement. In the interim, Imogen Dillon Hatcher has been named Acting President of S&P Capital IQ. Imogen is a seasoned executive with a breadth of experience in the industry. Previously, she was Chief Commercial Officer with responsibility for leading S&P Capital IQ's global sales. I have been working closely with Imogen and feel great about her capability to lead this business during the transition. And we are fully committed to S&P Capital IQ, which over the past 4 years, has become one of the fastest-growing providers of multi-asset class and real-time data.", "Now let me turn to the individual businesses. And I'll start with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. During the quarter, revenue increased 11%, operating profit increased 15% and the operating margin increased 160 basis points to 46.3%. Revenue growth is primarily the result of strong market demand for Standard & Poor's Ratings associated with increased debt issuance and bank loan ratings. Expenses increased primarily due to legal expenses. With the Department of Justice case entering the discovery phase and the State Attorneys General cases remanded back to state courts, our expenses to defend these cases rose during the quarter. In addition, compensation expense increased due to targeted headcount additions and increased incentive comp. Despite these cost increases, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services delivered solid margin expansion.", "You will see, moving to this next slide, that non-transaction growth in the quarter, which in aggregate grew 8%, was driven primarily by increased annual fees as we continue to expand our client coverage in Rating Evaluation Service revenue. Transaction revenue increased 14%, driven by several factors. First, as investors search for yield in a low interest rate environment, their demand for high-yield debt has enabled more corporations to access the debt markets. Second, financial services firms have actively issued debt, driven primarily by new regulatory requirements. And third, bank loan ratings revenue increased 19% as banks seek to issue new loans that are more liquid.", "As you see in these graphs, total issuance increased in the U.S. by 15% and in Europe by 37%. In the U.S., I'd like to highlight the strength in structured finance issuance, but which is primarily a result of the collateralized loan obligations or called the CLOs and asset-backed securities, ABS. CLO quarterly issuance was the highest since 2007 as banks moved loans off of their balance sheets. ABS included the largest quarterly issuance of auto debts since 2008 and credit card debt issuances almost doubled the second quarter of 2013. In Europe, I'd like to highlight the 44% increase in corporate issuance and, as part of that, the record high-yield issuance, which increased 109%. This is the second quarterly record in a row. And these issuance levels are a direct result of bank deleveraging.", "One of the questions that has been frequently asked is why is U.S. corporate debt issuance so robust when so many corporations have substantial cash on hand? In April, a Standard & Poor's report entitled 2014 Cash Update: Cheap Debt Fuels Record Cash Growth, this topic was discussed. Essentially, what S&P proposes is as U.S. companies become more global, they have been generating increasingly higher portion of their cash flow from overseas. This is subject to taxes as high as 35% upon repatriation. And this is a topic being discussed actively in the press. While many cash uses are domestic in nature, such as share repurchases and dividends, cash flow is increasingly generated overseas, leaving companies with domestic cash deficits even as overseas cash piles up. The S&P study proposes that companies are issuing debt as a form of synthetic cash repatriation.", "Moving to the next slide. Here, we depict a number of European corporate bond issuers by year since 1989. Take a look at the increase of issuers in 2013 as European banks deleveraged and more companies accessed the corporate bond markets. Also noteworthy is the growing number of high-yield issuers over the past 6 years in Europe. More recently, investors' appetite for high yields in this low interest rate environment has helped fuel an increase in over 100% in high-yield issuance in the second quarter, along with the traditional bank constraints and disintermediations.", "Now let me update you on developments on the litigation front. Our case statistics remain unchanged from the first quarter. That leaves us with a couple dozen nongovernment cases that remain outstanding. During the quarter, IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG filed a suit related to the Rhinebridge structured investment vehicle. You may recall that in an earlier case related to the Rhinebridge SIV, IKB was a codefendant as the manager of the SIV. We have filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit. In the CalPERS case, the California appellate court affirmed the denial of our motion to strike the complaint under anti-SLAPP law. We are seeking review by the California Supreme Court. In the Department of Justice case, discovery is underway, and we are working through our first wave of documents provided by the government while continuing to seek further discovery from the government and third parties. A hearing will be held later today in California in the DOJ case to address outstanding discovery issues. And as I'm sure you're all aware, the company received a Wells Notice last week regarding S&P's ratings of certain commercial mortgage-backed securities in 2011. We issued a press release about it. We're cooperating with the SEC with respect to this matter, and there is little more we can add on this subject today.", "Now let me move on to S&P Capital IQ, which delivered top line growth of 7% this quarter. Excluding a lost revenue from ongoing portfolio rationalization of several small products, organic growth was approximately 8%. The largest contributors to the growth were S&P Capital IQ Desktop and RatingsXpress. Adjusted operating profit increased year-over-year for the fourth straight quarter and the margin increased modestly. Lastly, rollouts continued on a wave of new desktop capabilities, which I'll discuss in a moment.", "Here are the 3 business lines within S&P Capital IQ. S&P Capital IQ Desktop & Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 9%. And this is principally driven by a 12% increase in desktop revenue. S&P Credit Solutions revenue increased 7%. This was driven by an 11% increase in RatingsXpress. And while the S&P Capital Markets Intelligence revenue only increased 1%, it was driven by double-digit growth in Leveraged Commentary & Data and Global Markets Intelligence. This was largely offset to get to the 1% level by shutting down of the FMR Europe and declines in Equity Research Services.", "We have several new products that are scheduled to launch this year. In the first quarter, we've already discussed the launch of Credit Analytics. And this quarter, I want to share more about PresCenter, which launched earlier this month. PresCenter is a productivity tool. It embeds Microsoft Office products within S&P Capital IQ Desktops to allow seamless links between data and presentations. It has customized features like quick keys and autocheck that ensure compliance with corporate design guidelines. And PresCenter streamlines pitchbook creation and ensures consistency with changes in source data. This is a product that many of you on this call will find very useful. And you can learn more at www.spcapitaliq-prescenter.com or contact your S&P Capital IQ sales rep.", "Now let me turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The business delivered an 8% increase in revenue with a 6% increase in operating profit. Revenue growth with increased licensing from ETF and mutual fund customers was partially offset by subdued derivative volume trading. ETF assets under management associated with S&P Dow Jones Indices reached a new record this last quarter. As discussed, our marketing agreement for the UBS Commodities Indices expired in June and the contract was not renewed. While we'll lose this revenue associated with the commercial arrangement, we expect our recent action with the S&P GSCI index license will largely offset the impact on profits. Year-on-year expenses increased 10% due to targeted headcount additions and the timing of marketing costs.", "If we turn to the key business drivers, ETF AUMs associated with our indices increased 32% to a record $719 billion from the end of the second quarter of 2013. Importantly, 11% of this increase was the result of new inflows. Frequently, when equity markets rise in a low volatility environment, derivative trading volumes decline. And that was the case this quarter as derivative trading volumes decreased. Two key products, SPX and E-mini S&P 500 Futures, the trading volumes decreased 13% and 26%, respectively.", "S&P Dow Jones Indices continues to expand its product offerings and partner relationships around the world. During the quarter, the business introduced the Dow Jones Commodity Index, which will serve as a complement to the S&P GSCI. In speaking with market participants, it became apparent there was a clear need for a commodity index which is highly liquid, avoids large sector weights, is transparent in its methodology and is independently governed. The S&P Dow Jones Commodity Index meets each of these criteria and fills an important gap in the marketplace. Witnessing interest in alternatively weighted strategies, S&P Dow Jones Indices launched 2 comprehensive global factor index families. The first, S&P Low Beta indices, and the other, S&P Intrinsic Value Weighted indices. They're designed to serve as benchmarks or investable solutions.", "S&P Dow Jones Indices launched the deepest and most extensive suite of African equity indices currently available to investors. New equity indices covering South Africa and Pan-Africa countries were launched, providing investors in Africa as well as those outside with a comprehensive offering of indices measuring the performance of African equity markets. And licenses for ETFs in South Africa, Nigeria and 11 ETNs in Sub-Saharan Africa have already been launched. Our clients continue to launch ETFs in other emerging markets based on the indices as well. This includes the listing of an ETF which tracks the S&P 500 on the Brazilian stock exchange; an ETF based on the S&P Colombia Select Index that started trading on the Bolsa de Valores de Colombia and is the first ETF launched in the Colombian market; 3 ETFs listed in the Korean exchange, the KRX. These track the S&P Select Sector Technology index, the S&P Select Sector Industrials index and the S&P Select Sector Financials index, and they represent new exposures offered via ETFs on the KRX. All great product innovation and international diversification from the team at S&P Dow Jones Indices.", "With that, now let me turn to Commodities & Commercial Markets. Revenue grew 1% in the quarter. But excluding the impact of the sale of Aviation Week, organic revenue actually increased 8%. Platts and J.D. Power both delivered organic growth in the quarter, which was partially offset by softness in McGraw Hill Construction. Overall operating profit was unchanged. Excluding the sale of Aviation Week, however, operating profit increased approximately 6%. I'd like to note that despite the absence of Aviation Week in our portfolio, Commodities & Commercial Markets was able to deliver identical operating profit as a year ago, which had included the results of Aviation Week.", "As you see here, Platts delivered a 9% increase in revenue for the quarter. Platts' price assessment and market data subscriptions continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth. However, Global Trading Services licensing revenue decreased due to weaker trading volumes for natural gas and petroleum. Trading volumes have been impacted primarily by the lack of price volatility, and secondarily, as a result of certain banks eliminating their commodity trading operations. With fewer financial players participating in the trading of commodity derivatives, there is less liquidity for physical players. Power & Gas and Petrochemicals, Petroleum all delivered single-digit revenue growth while Metals & Agriculture, building on recent investments, provided the greatest growth at 29%.", "Platts continues to launch new valuable products and services, and I'd like to highlight a few. The first relates to Platts' pioneering coverage for U.S. shale oil assessment for the Williston Basin. The new Platts Bakken offering, announced on April 23, captures an assessment of the value of Bakken crude oil nearest to the wellhead in the Williston Basin. That's the point where there's a choice of transportation between rail and pipeline. Some 70% of the total back-end production, at least 1 million barrels per day, has moved by rail thus far in 2014. But the role of pipelines will grow as several projects are coming online by 2016. In addition, pipeline capacity creates the need for price discovery at the point that allows for transportation flexibility in the largest base of Bakken supply.", "The second includes enhancements to the Minerals Value Service, MVS. It's an online platform for analytics. MVS is a Munich-based company providing an innovative and user-friendly solution to value-in-use pricing for iron ore. The MVS value-in-use application enables subscribers to calculate the fair price of their product faster and more accurately than ever before. And the third was the launch of Dry Freight Wire. The location of commodities is essential to the price discovery process, and shipping information is essential to our customers. Dry Freight Wire is a daily report that consolidates all of Platts' prices, news and market commentary related to dry commodity shipping. Targeted at shipowners, charters and trading houses, it addresses the market's growing need for an independent source of daily dry freight prices backed by sound methodology. This expands Platts' portfolio of products dedicated to shipping.", "Earlier this month, Platts announced the acquisition of Eclipse Energy Group, another acquisition that broadens our capabilities beyond oil. Founded in 2002 with offices in London, Norway and Singapore, Eclipse Energy Group is a leader in providing market data and analysis for European natural gas, power and LGN markets -- LNG markets. This acquisition enables Platts to help market participants better understand market dynamics and drivers of price. In the same way that BENTEK bolstered our U.S. natural gas business, we anticipate Eclipse Energy Group will help Platts succeed in a rapidly changing European natural gas market.", "Now turning to Commercial Markets. Revenue decreased 7%. However, excluding the sale of Aviation Week, organic growth increased 7% in the quarter. J.D. Power achieved double-digit revenue growth, led by the auto business and licensing fees from customer usage of its brand, led by businesses in both North America and Asia Pacific. As we announced earlier this year, we continue to explore strategic alternatives for McGraw Hill Construction. We've had conversations with a number of interested parties but cannot provide any further update at this time.", "Summing all of this up. We delivered another strong quarter as we continued to create growth and drive performance across the company. Total revenue increased 8% and was supported by 10% international revenue growth. We added another tuck-in acquisition with the addition of Eclipse Energy Group to bolster Platts' European natural gas capabilities. And S&P Capital IQ launched PresCenter, while S&P Platts -- S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts each launched a number of new benchmarks and products. Financially, the company delivered 15% adjusted diluted EPS growth over the toughest quarterly in comparison in 2013 and increased 2014 adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $3.80 to $3.90. Lastly, we continue to strengthen the leadership team to better position the company for our future.", "I want to thank all of you for joining the call this morning. And now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. Thank you.", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Doug. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call. This morning, I want to briefly discuss several items related to second quarter performance. This was a relatively straightforward quarter, so I don't have a great deal to add. First, I want to recap key consolidated financial results in the quarter. Second, I will provide updates on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. And finally, I will review our updated guidance.", "In the second quarter, revenue grew 8% with organic revenue growing approximately 1 point faster, the difference resulting from the sale of Aviation Week last year as well as the sale of Financial Communications and a small product line closure at S&P Capital IQ. Segment operating profit grew 10%. Excluding the impact of the sale of Aviation Week, all 4 businesses contributed to operating profit growth. Most notably, S&P Ratings Services led the way with operating profit growth of 15%. In addition, after cycling through a period of stepped-up investments, S&P Capital IQ has delivered adjusted profit growth in each of the last 4 quarters.", "Adjusted unallocated expense increased by $10 million due almost entirely to recent asset sales. During the quarter, the company entered into an agreement to sell the company aircraft at a price in line with its appraised value but did incur a noncash impairment charge associated with this transaction. In addition, the company incurred a one-time expense associated with the sale of its data center on the company's South Campus in East Windsor, New Jersey.", "The tax rate was 33.1% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date tax rate to 33.5%. This lower rate is the result of ongoing tax planning. For the full year, we now anticipate an effective tax rate of 33.5%, in line with year-to-date results, a 50 basis points improvement versus our previous guidance. Adjusted net income increased 13% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $1.06. The average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 2.2 million shares versus a year ago and over 1.1 million sequentially versus the first quarter of 2014. There were no adjustments to GAAP results this quarter.", "We continue to maintain an exceptionally strong balance sheet. As of the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and equivalents, of which almost $1 billion is held outside of the United States. We continue to have $800 million of long-term debt. Going forward, this strong balance sheet positions us to continue to make investments that strengthen the portfolio, such as Eclipse Energy Group, and as appropriate, sustain our share repurchase program. Our free cash flow during the first half of the year was $392 million versus $145 million a year ago. The improvement was primarily due to the timing of tax payments and increased income from operations. We continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in 2014.", "Now let me update you on our return of capital activity. During the second quarter, approximately 2.2 million shares were repurchased at an average price of $79.65 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 4.4 million shares at an average price of $79.06. That leaves 45.6 million shares available in the current share repurchase authorization. We anticipate selectively continuing share repurchase activity, subject to market conditions. In addition, we continue to return cash to shareholders through our dividend, which totaled $163 million year-to-date.", "Now I'd like to turn to our 2014 guidance. We have made several changes. First, because of the additional expense incurred that are associated with the sale of the corporate aircraft and the data center, we have increased our adjusted unallocated expense guidance by $10 million. Next, as previously mentioned, we've lowered our full year tax rate guidance from 34% to 33.5% as international growth continues to outpace domestic growth and the benefits of tax planning initiatives are realized. Finally, we've increased our 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 based upon strong first half results and a solid outlook for the remainder of the year. This outlook anticipates higher legal expense than we previously expected as well as benefits from ongoing productivity initiatives. The remaining elements of our 2014 guidance remain unchanged.", "In closing, we continue to focus on creating growth and driving performance. We have delivered strong first half results and anticipate similar results in the back half, driven by many of the secular drivers of growth previously discussed. That said, market volatility could impact results as the issuance trends can be volatile. Again thank you for joining us today on the call. And let me turn it back over to Chip.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Thanks, Jack. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we'll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "The first question is just on the cost-cutting initiatives. Could you maybe update us on where we are tracking relative to the $100 million plus cost savings that you folks had outlined? And also whether within that $100 million, do you have anything baked in, in terms of taking out supervisory labor within the Ratings business?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, we are very much on track in terms of driving the initiatives that support the over $100 million cost-reduction program. As we've commented earlier, it is going to take us a period of time to ramp up, given the nature of some of these cost-reduction programs. So as we've mentioned in the past, there is an initiative underway to consolidate our real estate footprint, particularly here in New York City. We are doing a great deal of work in the area of procurement, leveraging the scale of the corporation across a number of different cost areas, including technology and data. And we're making some choices. I mean, I think an example from today's call is just the decision to sell our corporate aircraft, which is another example of some of the specific decisions that we're making that contribute to this cost-out target. And then lastly, we are looking at workflow across the businesses to see if we can do things in a more productive fashion and in places that could impact some of the workforce and some of the businesses, including Ratings. Doug, I don't know if you want to add to that.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "I'd just add that there is a commitment across all of the businesses which goes beyond the $100 million savings to ensure that we're always operating with the highest quality of controls and compliance and with also productivity opportunities that allow us to operate with that level as well as having a good quality savings and better expense management. So this is a philosophy across all the businesses. You'll hear us talk about opportunities for continuous improvement and how we manage the place. And that's something that we're embedding in the philosophy of the way we work.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just a follow-up question on S&P CapIQ. You've done a lot of restructuring within that segment. There's been a leadership change as well. Could you give us a sense of how we should think about margins within that business? You talked about product rollouts. Is there a lot of product investment that's rolling through the P&L that's depressing margins this quarter? Or is the business just becoming much more competitive? How should we think about where we are in terms of margin and where we go?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, I think we did go through a period of stepped-up investment in that business. There remains a fair amount of investment that's built into the P&L. But you have seen a return of profit growth in that segment for the last 4 quarters. So on a go-forward basis, we do anticipate some modest continued improvement in margins. But we're also investing to be sure that we have a great growth vehicle here. So I think some steady margin progression is reasonable. But again our priority is really to drive growth in the business.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "The other thing I'd add is that you're seeing some overlaps that included products, FMR and some other research areas that we deemphasized and shrank. So there also are -- some of the margins have also been depressed somewhat by the overlap. So as we get past those overlaps and we get into the true organic growth, you'll also see some improvements in margin.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a last question, I'll turn it over, Jack. This is a question for Jack. Is the settlement amount with the DOJ tax-deductible for you guys?", "John F. Callahan", "We would expect perhaps, more likely than not.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "First, just to clarify a couple of housekeeping items. So the corporate expenses that you're now guiding to increase $10 million, that's solely because of the aircraft and the data center? And also just on the free cash flow, just to confirm, that $1 billion is that a calculation that's after dividends or before?", "John F. Callahan", "I'll take the last one. It is before the dividends. So you would have to take the projection for the full year dividend off the $1 billion. And then yes, the only change in our view of unallocated expense is solely driven by the impact, the noncash impact of the impairment relative to the corporate aircraft and the incremental costs of closing the sale of the data center. That's the only change on our unallocated expense guidance.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on CapIQ as well. I mean, it seems like at least the CapIQ Desktop and RatingsDirect and so forth, they seem to be doing pretty well. I was just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color in terms of the change of leadership there. And what -- I guess, you wrote in the presentation, search is underway. Like what characteristics you'd be looking for?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Yes. So first of all, as I said before, we wanted to thank Lou for his service to the company and wish him the best as he moves on to new opportunities. CapIQ is a business that has incredible growth opportunities when you look across the landscape of financial services with all of the different disintermediation going on, new players entering the market in the shadow banking world, non-regulated world. In addition, within the regulated world, all of the new requirements for capital, capital modeling, for pricing, for liquidity purposes, et cetera, and then portfolio management, liquidity management, et cetera. So we have different types of tools across that entire suite of needs and are focusing our areas in the Desktop & Enterprise Solutions. We recently hired Neil Smith to help us lead the Credit Solutions, which is a nexus point between our credit ratings intellectual property as well as our Capital IQ delivery channels. And Neil is off to a great start as well to bring more focus and more drive to the growth in the Credit Solutions area. So in a way, what we're doing is with Imogen, who is a great leader and our interim leader there, she's really helping the team focus on delivering what we already have in our pipeline and making sure that we have crisp delivery over the rest of the year of all our different new projects and in addition to that, having a strong strategy to address all of the needs going forward. So really you won't see a lot of changes from what we've already been doing with CapIQ. We really see that this business is on a great track already, and we will continue to focus on where we're headed. And we'll keep reporting out how things are going, all of the launches of our new products. But what we see is a great opportunity. In terms of leadership, this is a role that requires somebody to have a combination of knowledge of the markets, technology expertise and experience, especially when it comes to delivering complex product to the market as well as leadership and management skills. So we're looking for a broad set of leadership, management, technology and market skills for this role.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And I just wanted to congratulate Ken Vittor as well. And maybe if I can ask him 1 last question, which is just regarding this new IKB case. I was just curious maybe you can refresh us in terms of the statutes of limitations and if -- I guess, I was a little surprised that a new case was filed pretty recently.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Thank you for your comments. We have moved to dismiss the IKB lawsuit on statute of limitations grounds. We are arguing that, that case is governed by German law. And under German law, there is a 3-year statute of limitations, which we believe has long since expired since these events predate by more than 3 years the subject of the lawsuit. So we have filed that motion, and it should be heard and decided sometime in the fall.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from William Bird with FBR.", "William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Doug, I was wondering if you could just discuss how you see the S&P Ratings pipeline shaping up right now. And also on guidance, what does it assume for S&P Ratings in the back half?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, thank you, Bill. The S&P Ratings, as you know, has been off to a fantastic start this year but with a different mix than we've seen in a couple of prior years. First of all, we continue to see an increasing demand from bank loan ratings as well as what you saw in the European -- the slides we showed with the European bank disintermediation. So there is a -- continued to be a growth in areas that are tied to market needs. For example, as banks disintermediate and manage their capital more tightly, they shrink their loan positions, which means that they go to ABS markets. They're securitizing credit card loans or securitizing car loans. They're selling loans into CLOs. All of that goes into the structured finance market. In Europe, what this means is their traditional borrowers are packaging bonds instead of going for bank loans, and they're going to the markets with what you saw on one of our charts, Chart 13. You also see in the U.S. as well as in Europe an increase in financial institutions raising capital in the markets, both hybrid-type bonds as well as other senior bonds, which are required for part of their living wills and OLA in the U.S. So you see a mix shift compared to a year ago, when it was a very heavily corporate -- high-yield U.S. corporate-driven market. So we're continuing to watch markets very carefully to see how the trends continue. We do see some of these continuing through the year, and we've built that into our guidance. And so that's the type of analysis that we're doing for the rest of the year for the capital markets and the impact on Ratings.", "William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And I was wondering, as you look at how S&P is performing versus Moody's, for example, are there any observable differences that you see that might explain some of the growth differences?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "There's a couple that we see. One is obviously related to the structured finance markets in the U.S., in particular, the CMBS market. That's 1 very specific area where we have a weaker business. We are addressing that and looking carefully at it. So that's 1 area. Secondarily, there are markets like the European markets. They were slower to have a business there last year. First quarter last year, we had a stronger business than they did. They played catch-up and they've had strong growth. On fees, there's some shift quarter-by-quarter how you can see the growth, comparing ours to Moody's. And then on the transaction services, as you know, we have a larger non-transaction business portfolio than they do, which sometimes also has to do with the overall growth at the top line. In addition, it's a very competitive market. We have other new entrants into the market, and we see a lot of demand from the markets now for other players in the structured finance markets in the U.S. So many, many different factors for that, but we're very pleased with our growth and with our coverage of the markets. And we will continue to have this very broad global coverage across all asset classes and we will be competitive across all of them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just on Capital IQ, I know you've been asked a few things about it. But in general, I guess, some of your competitors, such as FactSet, have had better numbers like we as well. Do you see the demand environment changing? Or I guess, how much do you attribute to internal product development that's hitting the market versus an external market that's getting better for that sector?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, first of all, I think that there's different elements of what's apple and oranges. So comparing a straight FactSet to the segment of CapIQ is, as I said, a little bit of an apple, oranges. We have in our segment different products and services, which range from research, fundamental research, our Credit Solutions, our distribution of Ratings IP, which are not necessarily in the FactSet business model. We also have a different type of enterprise solution. So comparing them apples-to-apples for the whole group is not necessarily the way to look at it. When we look at it, we think we're very competitive with FactSet. We are both introducing new products. As I mentioned in the Ratings area, there's a lot of excellent competition. We have great respect for our competitors, and we see great things coming out from them. But we are also ourselves developing and delivering very innovative products that are driven by demand from investors and from financial services players in the markets. So we're watching our competitors closely, but we think that we've got in our pipeline and also in our delivery things which are just as interesting and just as innovative.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then Platts, the petroleum type of products, which I believe is still the majority of the revenue, I guess, single-digit growth versus I think it was still double-digit growth last quarter. Is that purely the trading-related revenue? Or I guess, if we looked at subscription revenue just for the oil or petroleum area, was there any change or, I guess, something to note?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Yes. Petroleum, in the petroleum group, that's our largest, and significantly in the first quarter, grew very quickly and had a strong quarter. This quarter was weaker principally because of the trading services. And as I mentioned, this lack of volatility and lack of liquidity is a big theme. It's not just one, as you saw with the Platts, it's also something that had an impact on S&P Dow Jones Indices in our SPX and E-mini trading on CBOE. So you can see that there is a trend, as you have things like the Volcker Rule and the new capital and the commodity rules coming into banks on their trading books, you're seeing lower levels of trading liquidity and you're also seeing lower volatility. So in our business, it impacted S&P Dow Jones Indices. It also impacted Platts. And that's the major explanation for the slower revenue growth in the Platts petroleum business in this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "My first question is on the Ratings business. I think you had given us a rough idea what your expectations for that business were for this year. Is there any update to that? And how should we think about the early-year strength versus what you're expecting for the full year?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Yes, we just gave for the total company.", "John F. Callahan", "Yes. We didn't give on specific business-level guidance. But I mean, just given the importance of Ratings to the overall mix both in terms of revenue and profit, it's not inconsistent with our overall company, that guidance of mid-single-digit revenue growth and sustained margin expansion. And I think it was nice to see the very strong second quarter for the business up against a very tough comp versus a year ago. And we look forward to the balance of the year that right now looks to be sort of in line with first half results.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then in the Commodities business, remind us what percentage, I think, it might have been 10%, but correct me if I'm wrong, is linked to trading? And what are your thoughts on that as we head to the back half of the year?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Do you know the actual...", "John F. Callahan", "Yes. The non-subscription part of Platts, which is largely the trading volume, is around 10%, so it's a small piece. So it goes back to Doug's earlier comments about we still can see strong double-digit growth on the subscription side of the business. And it's hard to predict the trading volumes. I think it's going to continue to remain volatile. So our current guidance does not anticipate a great rebound. But that being said, it's only 10% of the business, so I think it's manageable in the overall context of the total Platts business.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "And one of the things to think about is, as these banks shut down their trading operations, where do these people go? Do they spring up elsewhere and begin trading on other platforms? So that's something to keep an eye out for.", "John F. Callahan", "The other thing we keep an eye out for are broad macro trends. There's a lot of uncertainty right now is with what's happening in the Ukraine, what you see happening in the Middle East and also the new production coming on around the globe of shale gas, et cetera. So we watch these trends as well to see what sort of volatility will come back into the market potentially.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.", "Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC", "My first question, I guess, to put it this way, the most significant question or concern I get from investors in recent years is asking me what is the right capital structure for your company? Why do you not -- why will you not add 1 to 2 turns of leverage to buy back a lot more stock?", "John F. Callahan", "Yes, Craig. You get the question a lot and we get the question a lot. I think there's -- I think we should view where we are as a moment in time. We have maybe a little stronger balance sheet today because of the sale of Education, which gave us some additional inflows. We also, I think, for this moment in time, until some of the legal issues sort of are resolved as we move forward, we believe it's prudent to have maybe a little bit extra flexibility in the balance sheet because we don't want these issues getting in the way of us making decisions to build this business. So we also want the room to do an acquisition if we think that's also the right thing to do to build the business. So I think it is fair to acknowledge, we may have a bit more flexibility than we would need over the long term. But as some of these issues are resolved, I think we can kind of come back and take a fresher look at the balance sheet at the appropriate time.", "Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC", "Then my other question, if I could ask. Could you just talk a little bit further about what you're seeing in structured finance here in the first month or so, the second half of year just on top of the comments you talked about before? I mean, does any of these trends you're seeing -- you saw in the second quarter structured finance sustainable? Or do you think it's more of a blip?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "I think that this -- from what we see in structured finance market, sustainable, whether it's sustainable over, is it looking at a quarter, 2 quarters, 3 quarters, et cetera, there are trends right now with the way that banks are managing their balance sheets that they are shifting liquidity into their balance sheet by securitizing assets, which are easily securitizable with very strong traditional markets, like credit cards. Two years ago, there were no credit card deals being done. They started creeping back to the market. They were up over 100% year-on-year compared to last year. So you do see kind of those shifts moving around within the securitized markets. Probably the most curious securitized markets though aren't in the U.S., they're in Europe. The securitization markets in Europe have continued to be incredibly anemic for the last 5 years despite the interest from regulators and policymakers to see stronger securitization market. Mario Draghi, about 2 months ago, and the EBS published a report that if they wanted to undertake more aggressive quantitative easing in Europe, they would have to do that by buying up government bonds and municipal bonds, which is actually not allowed in their mandate or they'd have to have some sort of new interpretation to their mandate. So he's actually been trying to ask markets to become more active in the structured finance markets, so there are more types of assets to give more flexibility to banks to manage their balance sheet, to the EBS to have more tools in case they did want to take on programs like quantitative easing more aggressively. So I know in Europe, there's a lot of interest from different market players to try to have much more active and new markets in the structured finance area. So if we look at Europe, if we are able to see a return to structured finance markets that's not just covered bonds, which is really the only strong sector in Europe of structured finance is government bonds -- I mean, sorry, covered bonds, we should see some sort of return to structured finance there. In the U.S., my general outlook and what we've looked at with the business is continued strength in structured finance, although the mix might shift between credit cards, car loans. It might shift into more real estate. It might shift into more traditional corporate receivable assets, et cetera. But generally speaking, we see a continued robustness in the structured finance market with the exception of Europe, which needs to have some pretty fundamental changes in attitude as well as banks and others thinking about how they want to make that business come back to life.", "Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC", "My final quick question, please. In your Ratings business, how much was non-legal costs up, if the overall costs were up 7.5%? I just want to get a sense how it's trending. Was it up like low single-digits?", "John F. Callahan", "Let's just say, the most significant driver of increase in expenses was legal. But let's leave it at that for right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So Doug, you've got a new senior management team at S&P Ratings. It looks like they're making some structural changes in the business. Can you highlight some of the changes that are going on there and talk about how you see the opportunity to close the margin gap versus Moody's?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, there's a couple things about the structural changes. First of all, they're not driven necessarily to close the structural gap with Moody's. They're driven by doing the right thing for markets, to have the right type of approach to continuous improvement, which means that we're looking at the right mix of talent across different markets, where we can be close to where customers and where markets are, so we're on top of trends and patterns and activities taking place, whether it's in the U.S., the international markets. So that, first of all, we're looking carefully at how will we spread our talent and our people around. And what that means is it sometimes it means that we're going to have to rebalance. We're also looking at the rebalance of skills and to make sure that we have the right level of more junior analysts that are number crunchers and are coming up in their career, along with -- balanced with masters, who have very long careers and are known as experts in their field. So we're looking at different mixes of talent and different mixes of market coverage. And we're also looking at how we can ensure that we have the right type of technology. But all of this is founded on a foundation of control, of compliance, of ensuring that we're always doing the right thing for the markets. And as part of that, one of the results in my long career has been that when you focus on quality, you focus on process management, you focus on engaged, talented people, you usually also get some productivity opportunities. And out of that result would be potentially some cost savings. So there is an opportunity for us to, through a structural way, have potentially some savings to look at the margin gap with Moody's. But it's being driven from a different direction. Second of all, we do have significant legal expenses. That is, probably along with CMBS, the 2 major differences in the margin gap with Moody's. And clearly, we're looking at both of those. We have, as you know, an active program to actively manage our litigation with the DOJ and the states. This is not something that we're passive about, and we look at that very carefully. The 2 things that would close the margin gap with Moody's the fastest would be having no or kind of normalized legal expenses and getting a recovery in our CMBS business. So those are 2 things we're looking at carefully. But in the broader sense of operating, Neeraj Sahai is doing an absolutely fantastic job thinking about how we work, how we do our workflow, how we have the right resources in the markets, et cetera, that I mentioned before. But I'm very pleased with our progress there.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's helpful. On the legal cost front, is the current quarter a good run rate number? Or are there further step-ups to anticipate as the DOJ thing continues?", "John F. Callahan", "I think the current step-up is probably appropriate to get us through the year. But we're watching it carefully.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then just 1 last thing. Doug, you highlighted increased competition in the structured finance area. Are you seeing changes to the competitive dynamic in other asset classes as well? Or is it really just in structured finance?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "There are, in the e U.S., it's primarily in the structured finance area. And then internationally, in the emerging markets, almost every emerging market that has new emerging capital markets has local rating agencies. They're cropping up around the world. They're in Indonesia, in Malaysia, in the Middle East, in China, et cetera. So we do face a lot of local competition around the globe, and it's something that we also see. So you have that type of competition around the globe, and then you've got in the U.S., in particular, it's in structured finance.", "John F. Callahan", "And I'm going to have Ken comment on the phases quickly because I think it's helpful for folks in terms of expense discovery.", "Kenneth M. Vittor", "Yes. I mean, we are in the early stages of active discovery in the DOJ case so that obviously adds to the level of expense that we previously had. And then in the State AG cases, they have now been remanded to the state courts. And in each of those state courts, we are in the process of filing motions to dismiss on a number of grounds, including jurisdictional grounds. So that has added a level of expense this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess, Doug, first of all, you mentioned the CMBS area a couple of times. So maybe you can give a little bit more detail what's going on, and how you see that moving around. I mean, there were some headlines that there are some shifts in where people are or people essentially leaving. And I think talking to some DCM [ph], some people say you essentially exited the market now. So I mean, is this a business that you actually want to continue to be in? I mean, when I look at your numbers, I think this maybe is like a $0.02 per year kind of business at this point, if I've got my math right. So are you still very committed? Or is this something that you just pack up and focus resources elsewhere?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "We are very committed to the CMBS business. As I said before, we are a global rating agency with multi-asset class coverage. And so if we're retooling the business because we want to have resources closer to where the actual real estate markets are as well as some leadership changes, that doesn't mean that we're pulling back. So we are looking at some retooling of resources, but this is a market that we're committed to.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then secondly, also on the ratings agency, I think Janet Yellen, a couple weeks ago, made some comments around the leveraged loan business. And obviously, you highlighted it as an area of strength. And I think what she said is that the quality of that business has been deteriorating or the quality of debt in that business has been deteriorating. So just wondering how you see that business continuing to play out, if you agree with some of the things that she's saying, if that could change the kind of like dynamics in terms of what banks or players are involved in the business and obviously, how you fit in there.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Yes. I think that there are questions in the market, and we're actually seeing some of those. And we do have some research reports that Chip could get to you that we've been issuing recently about covenants, about leverage levels, things like that, that we've been seeing recently. Now one of the things that is different, so to speak, from the financial crisis is that the types of securities that could be linked to these loans as well as these loans themselves are not AAA-rated loans. They are loans that we're rating in the deep. Many of them are rated deep in the noninvestment-grade scale. They're B, CCC-type securities. And so some of the risks that what I see taking place in these securities isn't necessarily on the assessment of the credit quality, it's on the pricing. And so there's a lot of discussion going on. If you're seeing a CCC, CC, B securities which are being issued, but they are being priced as if they were AA securities, people could be taking more risk. And so later on, let's make sure that if something goes wrong, they're not blaming rating agencies for that. So we're looking carefully at that. But importantly, one of the very important changes or modifications we made to our overall Ratings business is what we call a Credit Conditions Committees. We have a quarterly team that gets together around the globe, first, regionally, and then at a global level, to look at trends and patterns and different signals that we get from the markets. We do this with our economists. We do it with different practice leaders, covering areas like energy, financial services, industrial, so that we can get a view. And we look for credit bubbles. And we have identified some in markets like China, like Canada. We're looking carefully at areas like leveraged loans so that we can also have an opinion about those. So I would say that Janet Yellen is seeing some of the measures that are important for us. We actually listen very carefully to everything that Janet Yellen says, like everybody else does, for any signals on interest rates or any signals that she's seeing in markets. The Fed has systemic-wide macro data, which is incredibly valuable for us to hear from her on those signals. And we've incorporated what she said into our business and our feedback. And as I said, Chip can get you some of the reports that we've recently done on this topic.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First, on Capital IQ, I just wanted to follow up on the topic of changes in the competitive dynamic. I know in the past, you've talked about using new product innovation to add seats but also allow you to increase pricing to narrow some of the gap between you and competitors. So I was just wondering, is that something you're seeing today? And how much of the 8% organic growth that you talked about is more of that pricing dynamic versus adding seats and products?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, first of all, we're doing both of these. It's too early to tell right now from some of the new products which ones are going to drive the growth because the newest products that we have are in launch right now, and they're still with new clients. They're not out at a volume scale level yet. But in terms of what's ongoing, we're looking at a combination of seats of overall enterprise pricing or by seat pricing, and then we're also looking at feature pricing. Some of the services that we deliver, as an example, in the Credit Solutions area, are certain models, certain data that's delivered in a way that there's a lot of value for the users in just paying for that data alone and not necessarily buying an entire seat. So we're looking at all the different elements of features of what we're delivering, what's the pricing level, and then what is the suite of products that we're actually delivering and how are we pricing for that because we think that, in some cases, we have more upside to price specifically for product features instead of delivering an entire suite that people might not even need. So this would be a great topic for us to have more discussion on going forward. Imogen is looking in depth at this topic right now. And it's something that we're looking at in depth, and it would be a great topic for future conversations.", "John F. Callahan", "But just 1 more thing I'd add is just, and there's always a challenge of trying to think through the actual market growth, given the broad areas in which this business competes in. But in general, we probably are benefiting more from growth in either the market or market share. [indiscernible] all being said, pricing realization is making some contribution to the overall revenue growth rate. But I think the market and share are the primary drivers right now.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And 1 quick follow-up, if I may. In the J.D. Power business, I apologize if missed this in the remarks before I joined, can you talk about where you're specifically seeing growth contributions, given the auto market has been pretty strong? How much of it is the Asia expansion versus strength in the U.S. or Europe?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "It's both. Well, it's both Asia and it's the U.S. Both markets have very strong auto businesses. So there's really 3 contributors. The first is the auto business in the U.S. Second is the auto business in Asia, especially in China. And the third is investments that have been made in other non-auto or other industries in the U.S. that have also started seeing some growth. So this has been a widely distributed growth story for J.D. Power. And it was double-digit this last quarter. So we are very pleased with the results from J.D. Power.", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo Securities.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I have a capital allocation question for you here as we are at the midpoint for 2014 and with very strong free cash flow. Just asking in terms of if you have any thoughts about how you want to deploy that as you head into the second half in terms of buyback and M&A activity. And then as an add-on to that, if there's any way to tap that $1 billion offshore either through M&A or some other way.", "John F. Callahan", "Well, let me start. I mean, going to the second part of your question, I mean, 1 easy way is to do an offshore acquisition. So I mean, that's 1 way. It doesn't help much in terms of share repurchase directly but in terms of international acquisitions. And I think while only a medium-sized deal, the Eclipse Energy deal is an example, it is 1 based in the U.K. and Norway. And I think if you kind of look at our track record of more recent acquisitions, I think you'll see a bias to acquisitions to build out our international footprint. I think it'd be a little bit premature to comment on going-forward capital allocation right now. We're always looking -- we'd always prefer to do value-creating acquisitions. That all being said, we have a great cash flow and we have a lot of balance sheet flexibility. So I think balancing the acquisition pipeline with share repurchases as we have is probably how we'll continue to work through the balance of the year.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "I would add to that, that this is a great problem to have.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It is a high-class problem, I agree.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Yes. So it's a high-class problem, as you say. But we also are very conscious that we're not going to just throw this money away. We have standards that we want to apply to how we manage our capital. We'd never just run out and do international acquisitions just to do international acquisitions. They need to be high-quality. In particular, they have to have high-quality management. They've got to be able to perform over the long term. They have to fit with our business. An example of one, which is not necessarily given a lot of exposure, is Coalition, which was done by CRISIL 1.5 years ago. Coalition has performed incredibly. It's a business that provides market share analytics and solutions to large global investment banks. It has been growing very well. It has a fantastic management team. So we look at -- we're not looking just to deploy the cash to deploy the cash. We have to do it in a way that is very thoughtful, it's meaningful and we work with the board closely on our philosophy about how we think about capital allocation. So we really appreciate the questions on that because it's something that we spend a lot of time and we take very seriously.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call.

Doug?", "Doug Peterson", "", "Thank you Chip, good morning everyone and welcome to the call. The Company delivered a terrific quarter with 10% revenue and 32% adjusted EPS growth. And more broadly in creating McGraw Hill Financial, we have made sweeping changes to the Company. In the third quarter of 2014, we continued to take actions designed to position our Company for innovation and profitable growth.", "Before reviewing our financial performance, I\u2019d like to highlight three matters including in our press release. First, during the quarter we announced the sale of McGraw Hill Construction to Symphony Technology Group for $320 million. The sale positions us as a more growth-oriented and profitable Company. Second, we took a number of restructuring actions in the quarter which impacted almost 400 employees. We remain committed to our growth and performance objectives we outlined at Investor Day, including our productivity goals. Third, Standard & Poor\u2019s rating services is in active discussion to resolve matters pending before the Securities and Exchange Commission, including with respect to the previously disclosed Wells Notice received in July, as well as related to investigations by the Attorneys General of New York and Massachusetts.", "Although definitive settlements have not been reached, a charged of $60 million related to these matters was recorded in the third quarter. Because we remain in active discussions with these parties I am unable to provide additional information regarding these matters at this time. Separately, I am pleased to report that the SEC recently notified us that it had completed its investigation of Delphinus matter. This was subject to Wells Notice issued in September 2011. The SEC has indicated that no enforcement action will be taken with respect to this matter.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our results. We\u2019re pleased to report excellent operating performance in the third quarter. Revenues, margins and profitability on an adjusted basis all improved versus the third quarter of last year. Leading the revenue growth during the quarter were Standard & Poor\u2019s rating services and S&P Dow Jones Indices, each delivering double-digit growth. S&P Capital IQ and Commodities and Commercial reported single-digit revenue growth and record adjusted operating profit.", "Adjusted diluted EPS increased 32% to $1.2. If we look at performance in the third quarter on a consolidated basis, revenue increased 10% year-on-year, adjusted operating profit increased 24% and we achieved a 420 basis point improvement in the adjusted operating margin, all very impressive accomplishments.", "For our year-to-date figures, revenue increased 8% year-on-year and 9% organically. Adjusted operating profit increased 14% and the adjusted operating margin improved 200 basis points. Our year-to-date growth in revenue, adjusted operating margins and diluted adjusted EPS are all consistent with our 2014 guidance. The Company has converted high single-digit revenue growth into double-digit diluted adjusted EPS growth, and year-to-date the Company has delivered free cash flow of $737 million.", "And our global footprint continues to expand as international revenue growth of 12% outpaced domestic revenue growth of 8%. In this chart you can see that most of our business units delivered double-digit international revenue growth.", "Now let me turn to the individual businesses and I\u2019ll start with Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services. During the quarter revenues increased 12%, adjusted operating profit jumped 24% and the adjusted operating margins increased 430 basis points to 44% in what has been a seasonally weak quarter. Revenue growth is primarily the result of strong market demand for ratings associated with bond issuance, bank loans and new entities. Adjusted expenses increased almost entirely from additional legal expenses.", "In an effort to streamline our operations, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings initiated a voluntary severance program during the quarter. This program accounts for much of the restructuring charge in the business unit. Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings delivered exceptional margin expansion during the quarter. In this seasonally slow quarter for issuance, the adjusted operating margin increased 430 basis points.", "We\u2019re always interested in making investments to augment our portfolio of leading brands. On October 1st, we acquired BRC Rating Services. BRC has 16 years of experience as a leading provider of credit ratings based in Bogot\u00e1. BRC provides approximately 300 ratings in Colombia covering corporate bonds, counterparty risk, securitizations and public sector entities. And this is a welcome addition to our ratings capabilities.", "You\u2019ll see moving to this next slide that non-transaction growth in the quarter which in aggregate grew 7% was driven primarily by annual fees and growth at CRISIL. Annual fees increased as we continue to expand our client coverage. In addition, they increased from a recent focus on better realization from frequent issuer programs. CRISIL delivered 13% growth primarily driven by Irevna which increased revenue almost 20%. Irevna provides Global Research & Analytics Services. Transaction revenue was up 18% due to strong growth in financial services bond rating, as banks continue to rebuild capital structures to meet regulatory requirements. While many of these large customers have signed up for frequent issuer programs, issuance that exceeds certain stipulated thresholds result in excess issuance fees. And these excess issuance fees are recorded as transaction revenue and contributed to growth during the quarter. Also driving transaction revenue growth was a 19% increase in bank loan ratings revenue. This is a continuation of a trend that we\u2019ve seen for several quarters now.", "As you see in these graphs, total issuance decreased in the U.S. by 2% while increased in Europe by 9%. Excluding the $49 billion bond issuance by Verizon in the third quarter of 2013, issuance in U.S. actually grew. In the U.S. structured finance issuance increased 37% and this is primarily a result of collateralized loan obligations or CLOs, with year-to-date 2014 issuance surpassing the previous annual issuance record. In addition CMBS had its strongest quarter of issuance since 2007. In Europe corporate issuance grew 10%, driven by investment-grade issuance particularly in financial services. High Yield decreased 21% following a record second quarter and Structured Finance grew 8% driven by ABS which increased 89% primarily as a result of auto issuance.", "Before leaving the topic of Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings, I want to provide a couple of regulatory and legal updates. First in late August the SEC published final rules under Dodd-Frank relating to NRSROs. Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings is undertaking a comprehensive review of the new rules and related adopting release which are over 700 pages long. As with all regulations applicable to our businesses, we will contuse to take the steps we believe are necessary to be in compliance within the required timeframes. Second, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings continues to work through a number of legal and regulatory matters, including the matters I referred to earlier that resulted in the 60 million charge in the third quarter. Starting with this quarter\u2019s Form 10-Q which will be on file later today, we\u2019ll provide a comprehensive update of material pending matters and developments in each of our quarterly filings. I would direct you to those filings for more information.", "Now let me move on to S&P Capital IQ, which delivered top-line growth of 6% this quarter. Excluding the lost revenue from ongoing portfolio rationalization of several small products, organic growth was approximately 7%. The largest contributors to this growth were S&P Capital IQ Desktop and RatingsXpress, which both delivered double-digit growth. Top-line growth in S&P Capital IQ is particularly impressive in light of the ongoing revenue and employment declines across the financial services industry. This revenue growth has enabled the business to report record adjusted operating profit and the highest adjusted operating margins since the second quarter of 2012.", "Let me add a bit more color on revenue growth in our three business lines. In S&P Capital IQ, Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 8% principally driven by a 13% increase in Desktop revenue. In S&P Credit Solutions revenue increased 6%, this was driven by 11% growth in RatingsXpress, and in S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence revenue decreased 3%. While leverage commentary and data and global markets intelligence continued to deliver double-digit growth, declines due to the shutdown of FMR Europe more than offset those gains.", "Now let me turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices, this business delivered a 15% increase in revenue with an 18% increase in adjusted operating profit. Revenue growth was achieved across all businesses, ETF AUM, mutual fund AUMs, derivatives and data subscription, adjusted expenses increased 10% year-over-year due primarily to headcount additions.", "If we turn to the key business drivers, ETF AUMs associated with our Indices increased 25% to a record $733 billion from the end of the third quarter 2013. Importantly, 10% of this growth was a result of new inflows. Derivative trading volumes picked up in the quarter with daily volumes based on the S&P Dow Jones Indices increasing 7%. The trading volumes of two key products SPX and VIX increased 10% and 12% respectively.", "S&P Dow Jones Indices continues to expand its product offerings and partner relationships around the world. During the quarter, the business announced an agreement with the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, BMV for index licensing distribution and management of BMV indices. This includes their flagship index IPC, the broadest indicator of the BMV\u2019s overall performance. S&P Dow Jones Indices also announced an agreement the Bolsa de Valores de Lima, BVL for index licensing distribution and management of the BVL Indices. All BVL indices will be co-branded S&P including a new version of the flagship IGBVL index and a new blue chip index soon to be launched.", "Interest in passive investing through index-based investment products is just beginning to take shape in Latin America, with more ETF assets based on our indices than any other index provider in the world. S&P Dow Jones Indices is in a unique position to help facilitate the growth of index-based investing in Mexico and Peru by offering a deeper and more prolific line up of benchmarks. By aligning to these premiere exchanges, international and domestic investors will have new tools to measure and potentially access investment opportunities in Latin America.", "Lastly S&P Dow Jones Indices in conjunction with research affiliates a global leader in innovative indexing and asset allocations strategies, launched the Dow Jones RAFI Commodity Index. There has been a lot of talk about alternative beta indices lately. This is another example of an alternative beta index offering from S&P Dow Jones Indices. And the Dow Jones RAFI Commodity Index offers a factor-based approach that uses certain criteria to under and overweight commodities, but with typical index merits like liquidity, governance and transparency.", "Now let me turn to commodities and commercial markets. With the sale of McGraw Hill Construction expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014, we moved McGraw Hill Construction to discontinued operations, thus restating our financials for 2014 and 2013 to reflect this. On a continuing operations basis revenue grew 7% in the quarter and adjusted operating profit increased approximately 9%. Importantly, the segment\u2019s adjusted operating margin has been materially enhanced. The divestiture of Aviation Week in McGraw Hill Construction coupled with the elimination of the commodities and commercial management layer has improved adjusted margins by approximately 400 basis points.", "If you go back and look at last year\u2019s third quarter results, you\u2019ll see that the business unit reported adjusted operating margins of 32.3% versus 36.7% this quarter. I want to point out that since commodities and commercial markets now includes only Platts and J.D. Power on a going forward basis we\u2019ll no longer be breaking out revenue for the two components.", "Now turning to Platts in the third quarter, Platts delivered high single revenue growth as strength in price assessment, market data subscriptions and a modest benefit from the recent Eclipse acquisition will partially offset by the weakness in global trading services. Global trading service licensing revenue continued to be impacted by weak trading volumes. Metals and agriculture building on recent investments delivered the greatest rate of revenue growth at 27%. On September 9th, IOSCO released its initial report on the implementation of its principal for oil price reporting agencies or PRAs. They concluded that quote \u201cDuring the first year of implementation, the 4 PRAs have made good progress with regard to the PRA principals\u201d.", "And Platts continues to launch new products and services. This slide shows the increasing breadth of the Platts business. Platts\u2019 leadership has worked steadily over the past few years to build an agriculture group, capable of growing beyond sugar and bio-fuels. Platts recently embarked on a its first foray into new agricultural sector formally launching its inaugural publication for the grain market. Daily Grains features daily price assessments for FOB Black Sea Wheat, Azov Sea Wheat, Black Sea Corn and CIF Marmara Wheat, as well as market commentary and price rational. The new offerings introduces the concept of price discovery into the Black Sea Grains market and frees market participants from gathering news and prices from multiple sources.", "The liberalization of Turkey\u2019s power industry was a driving force behind our July 2nd launch of new price assessments for the Turkish market and a new supplement to European Power Daily. The new assessment to new publication Turkish Power Weekly reflect nearly two years of deep market engagement in Turkey with key market participants. And on August 15th, Platts launched a weekly spot price assessment for Europe-delivered industrial-grade wood pellets known as I2 and a suite of UK wood pellet profitability spreads at different fuel efficiencies. The move was spurred by an emerging trend in Europe, of fueling power plants with I2 pellets alone or in combination with coal to cut down on greenhouse gas emission.", "Now turning to J.D. Power, the business delivered double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter driven by gains in the Auto business. Auto business growth was fueled primarily by the U.S. PIN and PIN is the power information network, the business as well as consulting. PIN provides real-time automotive information and decision-support tools based on the collection analysis of daily new and used vehicle retail transaction data from 1000s of automotive franchises. Details from these transactions are evaluated to create products that\u2019s focused on key measures including price, cost, profit, finance terms, lease and trading values. Revenue from global service industries which includes financial services, insurance, telecommunications, travel and other non-auto related customers increased modestly in the quarter as did revenue from advertising licensing, revenues from customer\u2019s usage of J.D. Power brand.", "In summary, I\u2019m pleased with the excellent operating results we saw in the third quarter as we continue to create growth and drive performance across the Company. Total revenue increased 10% notably with 12% international revenue growth. We continue to launch new products and establish licensing agreements. We rationalized our portfolio with the sale McGraw Hill Construction and we initiated additional restructuring efforts and financially the Company delivered 32% adjusted diluted EPS growth and year-to-date free cash flow of $737 million.", "I want to thank all of you for joining the call this morning and now I\u2019m going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. Thank you.", "Jack Callahan", "", "Thank you, Doug. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I want to briefly add a bit more color to several items related to the third quarter performance. First I will discuss the impact to our financial results due to the reclassification of McGraw Hill Construction as a discontinued operation. Second, I will review certain adjustments to earnings that were recorded in the quarter. Third, I will recap key consolidated financial results in the quarter. Fourth, I\u2019ll provide updates on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital, and finally I will review our updated guidance which is directly impacted by the elimination of McGraw Hill Construction.", "The sale of McGraw Hill Construction to Symphony Technology Group is expected to close in the fourth quarter. With the sale pending, we\u2019ve reclassified the business as a discontinued operation. It is important to understand the impact on our financial results from this change. All of the financial periods presented today, exclude McGraw Hill Construction results from continuing operations. This includes the current quarter results, as well as both year-to-date and prior year results. This change reduced our reported revenue, as well as our earnings per share from continuing operations. This has an impact on 2014 guidance as construction represented approximately $0.10 of earnings per share. I will provide more detail on our updated guidance shortly.", "Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess underlying performance of the business. In total pre-tax adjustments to earnings from continuing operations totaled $110 million during the quarter. The first of these as Doug already discussed is a $6 million charge related to certain regulatory matters. As we stated in the earnings release, there can be no assurance that this amount will be sufficient to resolve these matters or that definitive agreements will be reached. As Doug mentioned, we are actively working with these parties to resolve these matters. You should review our Form 10-Q which will be filed shortly for additional information regarding legal and regulatory matters generally.", "Next, that was a $46 million charge related to restructuring actions taken across the company. Consistent with our efforts to achieve productivity gains, we undertook numerous actions to streamline operations. Most of the charges recorded in the quarter were related to severance. We currently expect approximately half of the savings associated with these actions will flow to the bottom-line in 2015, while the balance is aimed to reallocating cost to fund longer term growth initiatives. As Doug stated, we remain committed to pursuing the growth of performance goals we outlined earlier this year during our Investor Day. Lastly, there was also a $4 million adjustment to Standard & Poor\u2019s Dow Jones Indices for professional fees related to corporate development activities.", "Now let\u2019s turn to the third quarter income statement. Overall these are just terrific results. Revenue grew 10%. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 20%, with all four business units contributing to this growth. Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings and S&P Capital IQ led the way as these delivered adjusted operating profit growth of 24%, most notably after cycling through a period of stepped up investments S&P Capital IQ delivered record adjusted quarterly operating profit.", "Adjusted unallocated expense decreased 6 million, primarily due to lower corporate costs. The tax rate on an adjusted basis was 33.5% consistent with our previous guidance. Please note that on a GAAP basis, the tax rate was approximately 39% largely due to the $60 million charge related to certain regulatory matters, which we have assumed is non-deductable. Adjusted net income increased 31% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 32% to $1.02. The average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 3.4 million shares versus a year ago, driven by both share repurchase activity and a reduction in the number of stock options outstanding.", "Now let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet. As of the end of the third quarter, we had 1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents of which almost 1 billion is held outside of the United States. We continue to have approximately 800 million of long-term debt. Our free cash flow during the first nine months of the year was $737 million. Going forward, we believe our balance sheet positions us well to make investments that strengthen the portfolio, including acquisitions, maintain our long history of dividend growth and as appropriate, continue our share repurchase activity.", "Now let me update you on our return of capital activity. During 2014, we have repurchased a total of 4.4 million shares at an average price of $79.06 to a total of $350 million. The total year-to-date return of capital in dividends in share repurchases is $607 million. We did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter. In the near-term, we decided to maintain the availability of domestic cash for potential acquisitions and other considerations. Over the long-term, we intend to continue repurchasing shares after taking into account the other uses of cash that I just mentioned.", "Now, I would like to turn to our 2014 guidance which we are updating due to both the sale of construction and strong third quarter performance. First, we are increasing our revenue guidance for mid single-digit growth to mid to high single-digit growth as all of our businesses are performing well. Second, our previous adjusted operating profit margin was an increase of at least 100 basis points. In light of the excellent progress we have made year-to-date, we are increasing this guidance to approximately 200 basis points. Third, we\u2019ve adjusted our guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations to reflect the reclassification of McGraw Hill Construction as a discontinued operation. This removed all of their earnings from our income from continuing operations.", "As I mentioned earlier, from an EPS perspective, this resulted in elimination of approximately $0.10 on a full year basis. However, based on the continued strength in our results, we can offset some of this elimination. Therefore, our new 2014 adjusted earnings per share guidance from continuing operations is the range of $3.78 to $3.83. Finally, we\u2019re slightly lowering our capital expenditure guidance to approximately 100 million. The remaining elements of our 2014 guidance remain unchanged.", "In closing, we continue to focus on creating growth and driving performance. Strong year-to-date results across our business units and the restructuring actions highlighted today are examples of our efforts to deliver on these goals. We remain very much on-track for a strong year of growth and performance in 2014, our first full year at McGraw Hill Financial.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Chip.", "Chip Merritt", "", "Thanks Jack. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. (Operator Instructions) I would kindly ask you that you limit yourself to two questions. That is two questions, in order to allow time for other callers during today\u2019s Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we\u2019ll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.", "Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James", "", "I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on the go forward impact of your restructuring efforts, if you can talk about what sort of expense reduction implications or operating margin implications that\u2019s going to have in 2015?", "Doug Peterson", "Patrick it\u2019s a little early to provide too much detail on 2015, but just going to a few, a little bit more detail. In general the restructuring charge was 46 million, on average for every dollar of structuring we save a dollar, just to kind of to keep it simple. And I think in our current forward look, I think you should expect that about half of that amount, half of that restructuring amount would contribute to margin expansion and profit growth in 2015. The other half we\u2019re selectively reinvesting in growth initiatives to really support longer term top-line performance as we go into next year.", "Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James", "And then for my second question.", "Doug Peterson", "Patrick this is just one part of our ongoing commitment to deliver at least $100 million of productivity by the end of 2016.", "Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James", "And then for my second question, just talking about your capital return strategy, obviously you have been doing the share repurchase this quarter. As you\u2019re thinking about your usage of cash and you talked about it for acquisitions or potentially other matters. For acquisitions specifically, historically I know you guys have been looking to use your outside the U.S. cash for that. Have you changed your thought process there? Are you more inclined to try to reserve some of your U.S. cash at this point for M&A?", "Doug Peterson", "Well your point observation is right on. I clearly would love to be able to deploy some of our offshore cash for acquisitions. It is just that not necessarily all of the interesting properties are offshore. So from time-to-time if there is a domestic opportunity, we want to be sure we have the adequate flexibility to consider it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "This is actually Craig calling on for Manav. I just wanted to ask around the new risk retention rules that have just been formalized. I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on the puts and takes around issuance after these regulations. And how you think the rules will impact the market?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes, this is Doug those are going to be very important rules that are coming out of the financial crisis in Dodd Frank. As you know these rules were required six different agencies to put them in place and so they have a lot of input, they went through two different rounds. The final rule themselves will take two years before they\u2019re going to be implemented. And in particular there is two areas which I think the most questions are going to be coming up around. The first is on mortgage securities and understanding what is going to be in or not in. And what are the rules is going to be around mortgage securities? Exemptions have been given for certain types of retail mortgages which had not been expected which actually might give more impotence to see more active RMBS markets.", "On the other hand the provisions related to CLOs are something that are new because of the two aspects. One is that, there are rules about the hold back period or they call it skin in the game, I call it eat what you cook. But the new rules on skin in the game applied to arrangers not just necessarily underwriters and originators. So getting that right and how that\u2019s going to be applied to 5% hold back could have some impacts in particular on the CLO market, that\u2019s the one people are watching carefully. But it will take two years for that to go into place. The second aspect also relates to what will be potential differences between European skin in the game rules and the U.S. rules in the case of any in the case of any kind of multi-national or international placement. So anyway short answer, the rules just came out, there are going to be years before they are implemented and we will obviously watch that very closely. No specific impacts that we\u2019ve defined so far.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then I guess with all the news around falling oil prices, could you talk about how lower prices or decreased production could impact Platts\u2019 revenues?", "Doug Peterson", "", "Yes, so there is two aspects to that on the first hand, there is because of the drop in oil prices because there are so many new types of oil wells and oil products which are being developed, it actually increases needs for us to have very specific oil well and delivery-related price assessment. So, on the one hand with things like shale oil, shale gas, new fields coming on place this is something that is valuable for us to have the assessments and the information for those types of new services. Where we see some impact is that as you have seen the banks retreating from the commodities markets and in particular oil trading they\u2019ve been selling their businesses and reducing the risk related to that. We have seen some lower levels of trading and so as you saw our growth estimates for the last quarter results in the trading part of our business we\u2019re not as strong as in our information side of the business. So there is some impact depending on where trading is, but usually the higher the volatility, as that goes up there is usually also more trading business. But we don\u2019t see any direct impact on Platts\u2019 revenue just because the prices are going lower in fact with all of the new sources of oil products coming on stream and with some of the uncertainty we expected there will be just as much demand as ever for our oil pricing services.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Okay, thanks for the color.", "Doug Peterson", "", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may ask your question.", "Alex Kramm - UBS", "", "Just coming back to the Ratings business, obviously you raised guidance I guess for the whole business, but wondering how kind of the current outlook here impacted that guidance or being more specific like what you see out there because obviously the quarter has been a little bit soft, but might be opening up a little bit now that this volatility has gone away. So, maybe you can just give us a little bit of color what you expect here in the near-term on the Ratings side?", "Doug Peterson", "", "Yes, so first of all just a little bit of color from the last quarter. Last quarter the issuance in the markets was basically quite strong as you can see from our results, but if you look at the gross numbers you\u2019d actually think that there had been a big drop in activity. There was a lot of impact in the size of the markets and the growth given the prior year there had been a 40 plus billion dollar Verizon issuance that skewed some of the numbers, but really if you go into the numbers there was a big mix shift in prior quarters there had been a lot of issuance of industrials, public finance and in particular of high yield and issuers both in Europe and the U.S.", "Last quarter industrials, corporates and high yield actually were a little bit lower than they had been in prior quarters and that was made up by financial services. So banks, broker dealers and others in the financial services industry increased their issuance dramatically in order to continue to raise capital in this very low interest rate environment, diversify their funding sources. So we saw a big increase in financial services issuance last quarter. And then in the structured finance market CLOs continued to be very strong, there was a lot of growth there, CMBS was strong, but RMBS continues to be anemic basically in the U.S. it has been a small market and traditional ABS which is things like credit cards and others has chugged along on kind of a normal level.", "In Europe there was a very large increase in traditional ABS which was receivables and credit cards and some there was a little bit of RMBS growth but based off of a low base. This is the Europeans would like to see more private sector bonds in the markets so they have more tools at the ECB to do quantitative easing and have ways to manage the money supply and stimulate the economies. Anyway for October, issuance on October continued along the kind of a mixed path that I mentioned, there is, it\u2019s something where the October issuance was continued on the same path for a corporate and high yield which was lower than last year but on the other hand financial institutions had continued to go to the market, ABS issuance was strong in October, it was up in traditional ABS, CMBS continued to be strong, CLOs have been a little bit patchy, there is kind of deals week-by-week and RMBS as I mentioned throughout the entire year has still been pretty anemic. So, we\u2019re going to watch carefully what is the mix shift during the end of the year and as I have said results so far in October were mixed.", "Alex Kramm - UBS", "", "And may be just quickly switching back to the margin here particularly on the Capital IQ side, I mean that one jumped pretty substantially not only year-over-year but also sequentially. So, anymore color that you can give there, I know there were product launches, I know some of the investment phases are over there has been some management changes but anymore color you can give in terms of how near-term sustainable these margins are or there was maybe something that was a little bit more one-time than we should think about near-term? Thanks.", "Doug Peterson", "", "As we mentioned before we have cycled through a period of stepped up investment and the business now has generated profit growth now for I think for like five straight quarters and I don\u2019t know if we are going to be at this margin for every quarter over the next two or three, but I think we\u2019ve moved to a little bit of a higher range here and we\u2019re going to look to kind of build on that over the next year or so. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s going to be straight line from here maybe back and forth a bit. But I do think we\u2019re sort of moving to a little bit of a higher more sustainable level over the medium term.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs", "", "My first question is maybe if you could talk a bit about what drove the double-digit increase in Capital IQ Desktop? How much of that is volume or is this pricing? And I was wondering are you taking share from others given most other companies that had been reporting are not growing as fast or is it simply narrowing the price gap versus some of the peers with more expensive Desktops?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes so let me take that. On the first part of it, there has been a -- we\u2019ve had double-digit growth in the S&P Capital IQ Desktop for a few quarters now. And it\u2019s driven by a few things. First of all it's driven by a broader sources of customers. So don\u2019t just think about Cap IQ going on the Desktops of investment banks and trading floors. It\u2019s broader going into middle-office and back-office, risk management, different types of users within financial institutions, it\u2019s being used more broadly and widely at asset management firms and insurance companies. So there has been an expansion of the types of users that we\u2019ve been targeting and working with to ensure that our services and solutions meet their needs.", "And in addition to that, we\u2019ve been able to add some functionality which is valuable for analytics purposes and through that we can also increase some of our pricing. But the main driver of this is actually volume as opposed to pricing. This is the way that we\u2019re looking at it and we\u2019re working with a lot with Imogen Dillon Hatcher who is the Acting President to ensure that we\u2019re very closely focused and targeted on our customer needs and products and service needs. But it\u2019s actually been chugging along quite well with this double-digit revenue growth as we have become much more targeted on the sales. So much more customer and volume driven and price driven so far and later this year and early next year we\u2019ll give you more guidance for 2015 on Capital IQ and all of our businesses.", "Jack Callahan", "Andre one thing I would add too, as I think with maybe a modestly let\u2019s just cal it modestly improving environment out there and some of the customer segments that we serve with the product are not only having good sales results, but for the rate of cancellations that we\u2019ve had it sort of dropped down. So our retention has actually improved a bit too, and I think that\u2019s also sort of supporting this nice growth that we\u2019ve seen.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs", "And for my follow-up I was wondering if you could maybe talk about investment for growth in the Indices business. Maybe talk about how attractive you\u2019re thinking about -- or how attractive you would think it is to build it organically or via M&A, maybe the thoughts around expanded beyond your core equities Indices where you\u2019re strongest, and how comfortable you\u2019d be doing out large deals to expand that business versus a series of small ones?", "Doug Peterson", "When we look at business it\u2019s really driven by taking a step back and thinking about the strategy that\u2019s going to fit, what are the trends. And the big trend that we talk about and we look at and we can see it. This is something you can actually measure is the growth of investible assets around the world from a combination of retirement assets building up in the developed market and investment assets whether they are for savings, for education, for retirement, et cetera as the emerging markets and other markets around the world have growing population. So we look at the broad trend and we know that we have a very strong platform in equities, as well as having very strong platform in commodities. And we also have the ability for custom Indices and strategic Indices that we\u2019re always investing in and growing.", "So if you look across that we would like to continue to build into that mix both across global expansion, you have heard in the last few quarters that we\u2019ve done business in Africa, we have started doing more African Indices, we\u2019ve done in Taiwan this quarter and Mexico and Peru. So we\u2019re doing expansion globally, these are fill-ins and allow us either through partnerships or acquisitions to fill-in our Indices space. We\u2019re very interested in continuing to expand our fixed income growth. This is an area that for us is quite strategic, so international and fixed income, are both really impotent elements to the business for expansion.", "We would look very carefully at any sort of property that was available in the market, whether it was large or small, if it was going to fit our strategy and fit our business model, we would look at it. But there is no comments that we can make on any specific transactions or anything that\u2019s going on in the market, but for us right now going back to where I started S&P Dow Jones Indices is a great performer. We have a great team there and it fits very well in our portfolio, especially in light of all of these very significant secular trends that we believe we\u2019re responding to.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray", "", "So tragically I am going to have to waste my question with a point of clarification here is the just the full year guidance meant to imply fourth quarter EPS of $0.85 to $0.90? That\u2019s question one.", "Jack Callahan", "", "I think it\u2019s 10 year is too better than that but I think it is that range Peter kind of get to the accurate, but I think kind of that is based going back to some of the comments that Doug made earlier about this sort of let\u2019s say, it is called mixed start in terms of the issuance in October so that combined we also if you just look at our trends in the last few years we tend to run a little bit heavier in expense in the fourth quarter, there is a bit of pressure in the Ratings business with legal expense and the one other consideration I would point you towards too is we really as yet have not had a full quarter of impact in the Index business of the lost UBS contract that we had and I think this would be the first quarter we\u2019ll see that full impact. So there is a number of considerations that we\u2019re actively positioned kind of given the strong results of the third quarter, and fairly conservative outlook for the fourth quarter right now.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray", "", "And then in terms of the restructuring asset, restructuring efforts at S&P Ratings and very impressive margin upside you saw in the current quarter. What should we expect going forward in terms of either additional restructuring efforts or potential to drive margin improvement there, how big do you think the upside is in terms of the margin leverage at S&P Ratings specifically?", "Doug Peterson", "", "Well, we\u2019ve talked about it in the past and the way we\u2019ve been thinking about it with Neeraj Sahai, who is the new President and there are different categories of expenses that we\u2019re looking at there is some of these that are very clearly ongoing permanent costs that we built into the organization things from compliance from control from a international network, those are we think are very important for us strategically to run our business. We have another set of topics which relate to I call them changes which we\u2019re going to, which will eventually go away very importantly legal expenses I see that as a temporary expense increase as I have said before once they\u2019re normalized that will help significantly with our margins and then there is efficiency opportunities that we\u2019re working on which as an example our recent voluntary retirement program allows us to reposition some of our labor force with different profile with some younger talent and so we\u2019ve got some opportunities to really work on efficiency. So, it\u2019s a combination of some permanent expenses we\u2019re going to absorb and really we can talk to you about those in the future, we\u2019ve got our opportunities for overtime eliminating some of our expenses and then we\u2019ll see those and then we have got some restructuring and efficiency opportunities that we\u2019ll be working on, we will provide more guidance for 2015 early next year and at that time we\u2019ll have more clarity on all of this and give you some more precision.", "Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray", "", "Alright, thank you Doug.", "Doug Peterson", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research. You may ask your question.", "Craig Huber - Huber Research", "", "Yes, good morning. My first line of questions just has to do with the lack of share buyback in the quarter and also almost want to ask, was there any I don\u2019t know restricted or material information that prevented you guys from buying back any stock in the quarter obviously first half of the year you bought almost 4.5 million shares but nothing this quarter?", "Doug Peterson", "", "Craig, even f there was I don\u2019t think we could comment on it so well let\u2019s just say we thought it was prudent at this moment in time just to have some more flexibility and the availability of domestic cash and due to some possible corporate development activities combined with other considerations in that. We\u2019ll come back, we\u2019re not -- share repurchases it is part of our financial algorithm and we anticipate that will continue and I think we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive in the past in this area. I just think for now we thought it was just appropriate to take a pause.", "Craig Huber - Huber Research", "So is that to say then down the road you would be open to using the flexibility of your balance sheet a very clean balance sheet taking on some leverage to buy back stock down the road? And then my following question if I could sneak one in here is, what is your backlog for breakeven.", "Chip Merritt", "", "Craig, Craig we are keep it to two today, keep it to two. Craig we are keeping two questions today please.", "Craig Huber - Huber Research", "Fair enough, Chip.", "Chip Merritt", "", "Thank you.", "Doug Peterson", "", "I would just take you back to where we\u2019d like to deploy cash I mean first we\u2019re going to invest back in our businesses to drive organic growth. Secondly, if we think there is value-creating acquisition to help us build our global portfolio that we\u2019d like to, that is our second place we\u2019d like to deploy capital. Third, we want to continue to maintain the growth in our dividend to keep up the wonderful history we have now over four years of sustained dividend growth. That all being said, once we exhaust those opportunities kind of given strong cash flow of this business, we\u2019re quite likely to have some balance sheet flexibility we had and we will continue to look to repurchase shares assuming that we believe that we\u2019re making those decisions at the right time in the market. So, that should be, you should expect that to be part of our go forward plans.", "Craig Huber - Huber Research", "Great, thank you.", "", "Doug Peterson", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. You may ask your question.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "", "Yes, thanks. Just on the restructuring program with S&P Ratings, some of the kind of the headlines there in the news articles we\u2019d seen related to it suggest there is basically pretty broad-based for just any one over certain kind of experience level that maybe unfair. But I guess just trying to understand I guess was it broad-based? Was it targeted and in particular spots of the organization where you saw kind of room for more efficiency. I guess just maybe what were you willing to try and cut out as part of that program?", "Doug Peterson", "Well this program was designed to maybe as opposed to the first word you used broad it was much more narrowly focused. It was U.S.-based-only and it was targeted to only directors which is a more senior level of management and above. And so this was a targeted reduction, if you think about it, it was a way to help us think more about the organization in a little broader way, more of a pyramid. And so it was more focused, more narrow and it was U.S.-domestic-based.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "And I guess the reason or the conclusion you came to that you thought there was room for that is or do you feel there is more, there is room for less managerial or I guess as you said a wider pyramid. I guess I am just trying to understand the logic behind that?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes think of it as an opportunity, I used the term when I talked before about how we think about our margin that we have some permanent areas that we\u2019re going to figure out, things that we want to keep, we\u2019ll look at them carefully, we have got these temporary blips in expenses things like legal expenses which eventually would be normalized. And then we\u2019ve got these efficiency in opportunities that we\u2019re looking at whether it\u2019s through technology or in this case looking at our workforce and how we can have the right type of workforce to respond to the markets that we have. And so we looked at this in a way that was really narrowly focused on what kind of workforce do we have and how we can look at the right kind of pyramid and the right resources against our market opportunities. So this was narrow.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Foresi with Janney Capital Markets. You may ask your question.", "Jeff Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets", "", "This is Jeff Rossetti on for Joe. Just a quick question on fourth quarter margin guidance if I could in think year-to-date if I have it correct the margins are up about 160 basis points and I think you\u2019re guiding for about 200 basis point improvement. So I just wanted to see what kind of by the segments what you might be expecting to improve. I think the Index business might have a good comparison. But just wanted to get your thoughts on the fourth quarter margins and how they might be settling out.", "Doug Peterson", "Yes and the way I want to get to into weaves in terms of by segment, I wish overall I think we were consistent with the guidance now of full year of margin expansion of 200 basis points or better that we\u2019re going to need to exceed that in the fourth quarter to make that work kind of given your observation on the year-to-date results. And obviously part of that will be aided by the overlap that we have in the Index business when we took a write-down last year in the fourth quarter, but beyond that I think we continue to expect solid contributions across the business lines like we have in this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Your line is open.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous", "", "Just on the increase to the operating margin guidance by 200 basis points. How much of that is just due to moving the construction business to discontinued operations?", "Doug Peterson", "It has a modest impact but it\u2019s trivial relative to the performance of the business. It\u2019s fairly modest. Keep in mind it\u2019s only on a full year basis around the $170 million revenue business and so in the overall mix, it is quite insignificant.", "Jack Callahan", "Let me just go back a second and give you a little bit of thoughts about our philosophy on this and when we had our earnings call earlier this year I mean I am sorry our Investor Day earlier this year, we talked about some goals that we have for productivity. And as we think about productivity for the Company it\u2019s a combination of scale and how we\u2019re able to take advantage of the kinds of, if you want to call it punch power that we have in our businesses for sales, for customer focus for innovation and how we can drive higher growth in our top-line. So one of the areas we really want to look at for margin it\u2019s not just about expenses, it\u2019s also about helping drive our growth in the top-line and that\u2019s really one of the most important messages that we want to get across that this is about the top-line.", "But at the same time we also want to ensure that we\u2019re running the Company in a way that is effective and efficient and so programs like the ones that we\u2019re talking about before in the Ratings business where we\u2019ve done a very selective opportunity for us to look at restructuring of senior employees in a very specific way. Those are the types of things that we\u2019re looking at that we could do across the company. But they\u2019re very selective and it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re doing in a way that is always going to be visible but it\u2019s a mindset about high growth, top-line growth and then very selective approach to ensuring that we\u2019re efficient with the bottom-line and we think that we would like to deliver both of them and get an increase in margin.", "So, overtime we\u2019re going to try to track both sides that have, higher growth, better sales, better approach to customers and then ensuring that when we use our assets and we deploy our resources that we\u2019re doing in a way that it\u2019s the best way to drive growth and also efficient so that we can be driving our margins.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous", "", "And just my other question is, so you said half of the restructuring cost is likely to fall to the bottom-line next year, how should I relate that to the 100 million and cost cutting initiatives that you\u2019ve laid out at Investor Day?", "Doug Peterson", "", "You should view it as part of that overall initiative.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our final question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Hi it\u2019s Johnson on for Bill Warmington. Just a quick question for the pending sale at McGraw Hill Construction, what sort of tax rate should we use on the $320 million in proceeds you\u2019re getting there?", "Doug Peterson", "", "Unfortunately kind of this was a kind of a business that grew up within McGraw Hill there is not a lot of basis here. I think in your modeling you should probably assume after tax, cash contribution of maybe around 200 million to be conservative.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "And just to be clear going forward this was I mean the last major change to the portfolio of McGraw Hill Companies?", "Jack Callahan", "", "As Doug mentioned earlier, this really kind of concludes portfolio rationalization that we have stepped out over the last few years. So, at this point in time I think our -- we would like to be able to perhaps now see if we can add to the portfolio moving forward and build on the top-line growth that Doug was just discussing.", "Doug Peterson", "", "Yes, let me add to that when we think about this top-line growth and there are a lot of very compelling secular trends that I just talked about one of them before related to the asset management industry and the increase in passive index-oriented investing, we mentioned a little bit earlier about the opportunities in the oil markets, the commodity markets. We highlighted some of these opportunities for you with the wood pellets, the I2 bio-fuel that is starting to grow in Europe. It\u2019s a very important area. So we\u2019re looking across all the different markets where it\u2019s research, it\u2019s data, it\u2019s analytics, it\u2019s benchmarks, it\u2019s all of the different areas which we already play in that we have a strong position in and we have strong brands in that we would look at both organic investment as Jack talked about before and then also selectively, selective acquisitions for us to ensure that we have great positions in these businesses whether it\u2019s through product expansion, it\u2019s capabilities expansion or geographic and international expansion. So right now our focus has shifted to growth and that\u2019s really what for us is exciting about being in this Company is how we\u2019re positioning for the future.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Got it, thank you guys.", "Operator", "", "That concludes this morning\u2019s call. A PDF version of the presenter slide is available now for downloading from www.mhfi.com. A replay of this call including the Q&A session will be available in about two hours.

[Operator Instructions] To access the webcast and slides, go to www.mhfi.com, that's M-H-F-I for McGraw Hill Financial, Inc., dot-com, and click on the link for the quarterly earnings webcast. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for McGraw Hill Financial. Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for joining us for McGraw Hill Financial's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our results. I trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events.

In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statement contained in our Forms 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "I would also like to call your attention to a recent European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of McGraw Hill Financial should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor, and potentially, the company.", "We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we'd ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 512-3151.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. At the beginning of 2014, during our Investor Day on March 18, we laid out our vision for creating growth and driving performance at McGraw Hill Financial. And as you can see, we made great progress.", "We completed the rationalization of all of our media assets with the sale of McGraw Hill Construction. We also resolved significant legal and regulatory matters. While these settlements resulted in a meaningful loss of net income for the quarter, our businesses are performing very well. Our adjusted results, which is the basis that we use to manage our company, show just how well these businesses are doing.", "Despite the headwinds of a strong U.S. dollar and collapsing oil prices, in 2014, the company achieved 7% growth in revenue from continuing operations, as clients around the world increasingly sink -- seek the essential intelligence we provide. Importantly, every business unit delivered top line growth and margin improvement. The company also delivered a 280-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. The combination of increased revenue and improved profitability led to the generation of more than $1 billion in free cash flow for the year. We also added talented leaders to the management team. Imogen Dillon Hatcher was named President of S&P Capital IQ, and Lucy Fato appointed Executive Vice President and General Counsel. These are capable leaders who are already making a difference.", "One of the most significant developments in the quarter was the resolution of legal and regulatory matters with the Department of Justice and the Attorneys General of 19 states and the District of Columbia; CalPERS, relating to 3 structured investment vehicles; the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Attorneys General of New York and Massachusetts; and several private litigations stemming from the financial crisis. As a result of these settlements, we recorded a fourth quarter charge of $1.552 billion.", "Now let me provide more color on our 2014 accomplishments. During 2014, we expanded our global footprint and reach. Platts acquired Eclipse and relocated its head office to London. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services acquired BRC Investor Services in Colombia. S&P Capital IQ added private company financial data for scores of Australian, Brazilian and Indian companies. S&P Dow Jones Indices continued to partner with important exchanges around the world, reaching or expanding agreements with the Bolsa de Valores de Lima, Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, Bovespa and the Korea Exchange. And J.D. Power launched financial services offerings in Southeast Asia and Australia, as well as a digital automotive retail performance improvement platform in China.", "As we look at the company's financial performance over the last 3 years, you can see consistent improvements in revenue, margin and EPS. Revenue from continuing operations has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate. Our adjusted margins have improved 680 basis points from 21 -- 29.1% to 35.9%. And we've achieved a compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share of 24%.", "Now let's turn to our 2014 results. Revenue increased 7% year-on-year, adjusted operating profit increased 17%, adjusted operating margin increased 280 basis points and diluted adjusted EPS increased 20%. All of our business units delivered revenue growth, increased adjusted operating profit and improvement in adjusted operating margins. This balanced contribution across all business units is a core strength of McGraw Hill Financial.", "As we look at the fourth quarter, we finished the year with strong results. Revenue grew 7%, with all business units contributing mid- to high-single-digit growth. Meaningful adjusted margin expansion continued. Although it should be noted that in the fourth quarter 2013, S&P Dow Jones Indices recorded a $26 million noncash impairment charge impacting those results. Notwithstanding this charge, the adjusted margin would still have increased significantly. And fourth quarter diluted adjusted EPS increased 23%. Our global footprint continues to expand as international revenue growth of 8% outpaced domestic growth of 7%. In this chart, you can see that Commodities & Commercial Markets, in particular, delivered the strongest international revenue growth.", "Now let me turn to the individual businesses, and I'll start with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. In 2014, revenue increased 8%, adjusted operating profit grew 13% and the adjusted operating margin increased 190 basis points to 43.8%. And during the quarter, revenue increased 8%, adjusted operating profit jumped 18% and the adjusted operating margin increased 380 basis points to 42.2%. S&P Ratings Services continues to make progress in improving margins. In fact, adjusted expenses in the quarter only increased 1% despite elevated costs related to recently resolved legal and regulatory matters.", "Reviewing the next slide, non-transaction revenue growth, both in 4Q and for the full year, was driven by annual fees derived predominantly from frequent-issuer relationship fees and surveillance and from Rating Evaluation Service revenue. Demand for corporate debt ratings and bank loan ratings drove overall 2014 transaction revenue. While in the fourth quarter, growth was driven by demand for corporate and public finance ratings.", "If we turn to issuance, U.S. and European trends diverged in the fourth quarter, with 20% increase in U.S. issuance and a 12% decrease in European issuance. And this mirrors the macroeconomic trends of growth in the U.S. and uncertainty that we saw in the fourth quarter in Europe. Fourth quarter issuance in the U.S. was quite strong across all dimensions. Investment-grade increased 22%, high-yield increased 17%, public finance was up 23% and structured finance also rose at 14%, driven by CLOs, ABS and RMBS. In Europe, although corporate issuance was very weak, structured finance increased 49%, especially through a surge in RMBS through a refocusing of the United Kingdom funding for lending scheme, away from mortgage lending.", "This next chart depicts the number of European corporate issuers, a very important trend that we're watching. You can see a significant increase in our European customer base in the past 2 years. In order for European companies to meet their borrowing needs, they're increasingly turning to the capital markets. While quarterly issuance volumes ebb and flow, this is a very bullish long-term trend.", "Now let me turn to Capital IQ. In 2014, in S&P Capital IQ, organic revenue grew 7%, adjusted segment operating profit grew 18% and adjusted margin increased 190 basis points. After 2 years of investments, the business delivered adjusted operating margin improvement for the year. And the fourth quarter results were largely consistent with the full year results. Let me add a bit more color on full year revenue growth in the 3 business lines in 2014. S&P Capital IQ Desktop & Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 8%, and this was principally driven by an 11% increase in Desktop revenue. S&P Credit Solutions revenue increased 6% from a 10% increase in RatingsXpress. In the smallest category, S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence, revenue decreased 3% overall. While Leveraged Commentary & Data and Global Markets Intelligence continued to deliver double-digit growth, declines in Equity Research Services and the shutdown of FMR Europe more than offset those gains.", "Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. In 2014, this business delivered a 12% increase in revenue, with a 32% increase in adjusted operating profit. Revenue growth was achieved across every dimension of the business: ETF AUM, mutual fund AUM, derivatives and data subscription. In 2014, every dollar of incremental revenue growth resulted in $1 of incremental adjusted operating profit. This resulted in a 2014 adjusted segment operating profit margin of 63.6%. The fourth quarter results generally mirrored the results for the full year, except that the impacts from the $26 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 had an impact on year-over-year comparisons.", "If we turn to the key business drivers. The ETF industry experienced record inflows of $331 billion in 2014. The trend towards passive investing continues, and S&P Dow Jones Indices, with its broad and innovative array of indices, is at the forefront of this trend. ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 25% from the end of 2013 to $832 billion. Importantly, 15% of this growth was a result of new inflows. Mutual fund AUM associated with our indices reached another major milestone in 2014, surpassing the $1 trillion mark. With volatility roaring back in the fourth quarter, derivative trading volumes picked up with daily activity based on the S&P Dow Jones Indices growing 20%. But for all of 2014, yearly volumes only increased 4% as volatility was very, very low for most of the year.", "On to Commodities & Commercial Markets. As a reminder, McGraw Hill Construction was sold and its results moved to discontinued operations, thus, our financials for 2014 and 2013 do not include these results. On a continuing operations basis, 2014 organic revenue, excluding the impacts of the Eclipse acquisition and the Aviation Week divestiture, grew 9%. The adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 34.3%. The 130 basis points adjusted margin improvement from continuing operations is only part of the story. Taking into consideration the sale of McGraw Hill Construction, as well as margin improvements for continuing operations, the adjusted operating margin actually increased 370 basis points.", "Fourth quarter organic revenue from continuing operations increased 7%, and the adjusted operating margin decreased 120 basis points. During the fourth quarter, margins were impaired by timing of investments in J.D. Power to fully operationalize next-gen platforms and extend PIN data. By investing in new global products, global workflow tools and client delivery platforms, [indiscernible] J.D. Power to achieve continued revenue growth. In addition, the acquisition of Eclipse had a modest negative impact on margins.", "For Platts, fourth quarter revenue was the strongest of the year, capping high single-digit organic revenue growth for 2014. With a backdrop of dramatically reduced oil prices, Petroleum, the largest category, delivered high single-digit growth in both the quarter and the year through increased demand for price assessments and market data subscription. By providing transparent pricing data and analysis, Platts assisted customers in managing commodity price volatility. Based on recent investments in Steel Business Briefing and Kingsman, Metals & Agriculture delivered the greatest rate of growth in 2014 at 34%. Global Trading Services' revenue increased in the fourth quarter, primarily in Metals & Agriculture, but was down for the year. Despite increased oil volatility, trading, based upon our price, remains subdued due to regulation and the exit of several financial institutions from the business.", "Finally, J.D. Power finished the year with its highest revenue quarter, delivering low-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter and high single-digit revenue growth for the year. Asia revenue led the way with 10% growth for the year. Overall, in both the quarter and the year, growth was paced by gains in the auto business, thanks to PIN and our consulting business. The second largest contributor to 2014 growth was advertising licensing revenue from customers' usage of the J.D. Power brand, and this advertising extends well beyond the auto sector. Global Services industry, which is all of our non-auto businesses, delivered low single-digit growth in 2014.", "In summary, the company delivered solid yearly results, while also completing our portfolio rationalization and resolving significant legal and regulatory matters. It has been gratifying, particularly with all our business units contributing to growth in revenue from continuing operations and significant margin improvement. Thanks to the effort of some 17,000 employees around the world, we delivered continued adjusted operating profit margin improvements of 280 basis points for the company. And the combination of strong revenue growth and adjusted margin expansion yielded strong diluted adjusted earnings per share of $3.88.", "As we turn to 2015, I want to reiterate our focus on creating growth and driving performance. We're introducing guidance of mid-single-digit revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.45. As we launch 2015, the entire organization is aligned around key themes, and these include strengthening customer and stakeholder engagement, accelerating our international growth, sustaining our margin expansion and having discipline in capital allocation, and all the while, managing and mitigating risks throughout the company.", "With that, I want to thank all of you for joining the call this morning. And now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer.", "John F. Callahan", "Thank you, Doug. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I want to discuss several items in more detail related to fourth quarter and full year performance. I will recap consolidated income statement results both for the quarter and the year; review the recent charges related primarily to legal regulatory items; I will also review the restructuring actions taken across the portfolio in the quarter, including an update on our progress on the $100 million cost-reduction program that we introduced early last year; discuss the free cash flow results; provide a return of capital update; and finally, I will provide additional color on our 2015 guidance.", "Let me start by reviewing our fourth quarter results. Please note that these figures are adjusted financials, as our GAAP results were materially impacted by settlements and, to a lesser extent, restructuring actions. I will discuss the GAAP results in just a moment. As Doug noted, our portfolio of businesses is performing quite well and closed out 2014 with solid results. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew 7%. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 25%, with all 4 business units contributing to this growth. Adjusted unallocated expense was flat versus a year ago. Total expenses declined more than 1%, contributing to an adjusted consolidated operating profit growth of 28%, a 570-basis-point increase in the company's adjusted profit margin.", "The tax rate on an adjusted basis was 32%, as the full year came in a bit better than expected. Adjusted net income increased 22%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.95. The average adjusted diluted shares outstanding decreased by 1%, due in part to share repurchase activity completed in the first half of 2014. The impact of foreign exchange in the quarter was a bit more significant versus previous quarter, although it was relatively modest overall. Revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 1 point of growth. Operating profit benefited by approximately 2 points of growth due to the ForEx impact on non-U.S.-denominated expenses.", "Now let's turn to the full year results. Revenue grew 7% to well over $5 billion. The impact of ForEx on full year revenue is negligible. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 16%, with all 4 business units contributing to this growth. Adjusted unallocated expense increased 7%, primarily due to an impairment charge associated with the sale of a corporate aircraft and a onetime expense associated with the sale of a data center that we recorded in the second quarter.", "Total adjusted expenses for the full year increased to less than 3%, contributing to adjusted operating profit growth of 17%, driving a 280-basis-point increase in the company's adjusted profit target. The tax rate on an adjusted basis was 33.1%, a reduction of 80 points versus a year ago. Overall, adjusted net income increased 19%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $3.88. The average adjusted diluted shares outstanding decreased by 1%. Overall, a strong year of performance.", "Because of the significant legal and restructuring charges, we added this bridge, which I hope will be instructive. During the year, the company recorded $1.7 billion in charges largely associated with regulatory matters and, to a lesser amount, restructuring. These charges were predominantly recorded in the fourth quarter. The after-tax impact of these items was approximately $1.4 billion. The effective tax rate is approximately 20% in aggregate as a result of all of these charges.", "To provide additional clarity, we have broken out all of the second half charges related specifically to legal/regulatory matters, which totaled just over $1.6 billion. We would expect all of these payments to be made by the first quarter of 2015. I would note that in addition to significant settlements with the Department of Justice, the Attorneys Generals of set 19 states and the District of Columbia and CalPERS, there was $17 million in additional charges associated with the final settlement with the SEC, New York and Massachusetts, and $35 million associated with settlements in several private litigation items stemming from the financial crisis. Because of the strong balance sheet we have maintained, we have ample flexibility to make these payments. Most of the payments will come out of cash on hand and our $1 billion credit facility, which remains untapped at this point in time.", "Now let me provide some color on restructuring actions in the quarter. Last year, we established a cost-reduction target of at least $100 million by the end of 2016. One aspect of that program was identifying efficiency opportunities in our work processes without compromising the quality and timeliness in how we serve customers. As a result, there have been restructuring actions across the portfolio. During the second half of 2014, we took restructuring charges totaling $86 million, with $41 million in the fourth quarter. These actions are a meaningful part of our ongoing cost-reduction program to sustain margin expansion.", "Now let me provide an update on the progress we are making overall on this cost-reduction program that we discussed in our Investor Day last year. Our goal has been to achieve more than $100 million of cost reduction over a 3-year period. The pieces of the pie have been sized to display the actual cost savings that we have identified in restructuring our workforce, streamlining our real estate portfolio, leveraging our procurement scale and reducing corporate costs. We are very much on track with this cost-reduction program and now target exceeding initial target, as $140 million in opportunities have been identified. We expect that more than 3/4 of these savings will be realized by the end of 2015. Let me remind you that some of our cost reduction will be reinvested in growing our business. For example, while Platts is reducing its workforce in some areas, it is adding it into others, namely its Metals & Agriculture business.", "Now let me update you on free cash flow. Our guidance was to achieve free cash flow of approximately $1 billion, and we achieved that. Our cash balance at the end of 2014 was approximately $2.5 billion. In 2014, our return of capital in dividends and share repurchases was $688 million. 2014 share repurchases totaled 4.4 million shares. We did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter.", "Next, I'd like to provide you with a broader view of our return of capital. The company has an outstanding record of returning cash to shareholders. We have returned approximately $3.3 billion in the last 3 years in share repurchases and dividends. We announced today that for 2015, the Board of Directors has authorized a 10% increase in the dividend to an annual payout of $1.32 per share. This marks the 42nd year of sustained dividend increases. As we look forward, we will remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy. But now that we have addressed the most significant legal/regulatory matters facing the company, we can put more focus on driving shareholder value. Just to remind you on our priorities on the allocation of capital: first, we will invest in organic growth; second, continue to pursue attractive acquisitions to expand the portfolio; third, sustain growth in our dividend, as today's announcement demonstrates; and finally, continue to selectively repurchase shares. We currently expect to resume your share repurchase program subject to market conditions. As a reminder, we have 45.6 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. Furthermore, we will also consider additional leverage in the balance sheet, as appropriate, to both create growth and drive shareholder value.", "Finally, I'd like to provide more detail on our outlook for 2015. Guidance is as follows: Mid-single-digit revenue growth. We are mindful that the strong U.S. dollar will likely negative our revenue growth a bit. We are targeting more than 125 basis points of adjusted profit margin improvement, a tax rate on an adjusted basis of approximately 33%, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.45. You should assume approximately $100 million of capital expenditures. And we are targeting free cash flow of greater than $1.1 billion, excluding the payments related to these legal and regulatory settlements. In closing, our businesses are performing very well, as clearly demonstrated in our 2014 adjusted operating results and this 2015 guidance, in line with our longer-term financial goals. Overall, we remain focused on creating growth and driving performance.", "Thank you for joining us this morning for the call. Let me turn it back over to Chip Merritt to open up the Q&A session.", "Robert S. Merritt", "Thanks, Jack. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Alex Kramm, UBS.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I think we'll -- let's start with Jack. Jack, I think you when our appetite a little bit here at the end there with your comment on leverage. You've made some comments in the past in terms of the capacity you think the company could take. So -- but you obviously haven't opened the door yet. So what's holding you back? Where do you think you can go? And what do you need to evaluate to potentially do -- would you do something like an ASR or something like that since you haven't been in the market in a while for buybacks?", "John F. Callahan", "Yes, Alex, first of all, we do anticipate resuming the share repurchase program, as we commented. But it is a new time for us, right? We do -- we've moved past this moment in time. We have more flexibility now that we've addressed some of the largest legal and regulatory issues facing the company. So yes, we could and will contemplate selectively adding leverage as appropriate, either to appropriate acquisitions and/or to accelerate share repurchases. And we have ample capacity to do that. Our goal is to remain investment grade, and so we have ample capacity to consider all those options. And frankly, we're looking forward to having that flexibility to think about those moving forward.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then maybe secondly, I guess staying on the topic of the legal resolution. I think you've made comments in the past, there's been significant legal costs, obviously, running through the Ratings business. So now that a lot of this is resolved, can you kind of give us a flavor of how much that was at the end here? How quickly some of these costs are going to come down, given that there's still some ongoing issues, obviously, with some other -- and then in general, maybe just talk about the Ratings efficiency opportunities that exist outside of the legal side a little bit more?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, just first on legal. As we have spoken in past calls, legal spend has grown significantly. And it was probably the most significant area of expense growth in the Ratings business. As we go through 2015, our guidance does assume that our legal expense begins to decline, that probably -- particularly as we start or begin to the second quarter and beyond. So we do think it begins to add to margin expansion. That all being said, while I think we have addressed some of the major issues facing the company from a legal point of view, there will be -- there continues to be some legal issues that we have to continue to monitor. So it's not going to go to 0. But we do think it's going to make a meaningful contribution to margin expansion for the year. And then back to your other question about efficiency opportunities. I think, as you can see in the restructuring actions that we've taken, both in the third and fourth quarter across Ratings business, the team has identified -- they have a new program in place, it's called The Way We Work, and it is simplifying and streamlining the work we do every day to produce a rating on a timely fashion in a high-quality way. And we're quite confident that as we continue to drive that program, that can continue further opportunities to improve our quality and improve our turnaround time, and over time, continue to generate efficiencies.", "Operator", "Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So Doug, given the great success you've had here early on in terms of narrowing the margin gap at both Ratings and some of the other units relative to peers, I'm wondering if you're feeling more confident in terms of your ability to get closer to some of these peers from a margin perspective.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, thank you, Peter, for the question. That's a valuable focus that we're talking about. As you can see from our guidance that we just gave, we're looking at increasing our adjusted operating profit margin by another 125 basis points for the whole company. It is a very important focus of ours. And obviously, in order to get it right, it requires both a quarter-by-quarter review as well as a longer-term view. And we've got initiatives to grow our top line, and we've talked about a few of them with you. Our focus on customers, which includes how we can have better penetration, our coverage, our segmentation, our pricing. And in addition to that, other ways that we can increase our jaws to get also a much more efficient focus on expenses. We do benchmark against other peers in the market. And some of them, we have better margins than others. We are looking at improving our margins. But this is a very, very big focus of the entire management team.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Understood. And then, Jack, just as my follow-up, can you give us something explicit in terms of what's assumed in terms of buybacks and the EPS guidance?", "John F. Callahan", "Peter, we -- our guidance does assume, let's call it, more of a foundational amount of share repurchases. Nothing, let's call it, terribly heroic. However, I think as we go through the year, we'll be obviously -- we'll have some opportunities to come back and reevaluate that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik, Barclays.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just firstly on the guidance as well. The mid-single-digit revenue growth, does that include the negative FX impact? And also, could you help us out with some of your currency exposures on revenue and cost side and how we should try and model there?", "John F. Callahan", "Yes, no, our revenue guidance does assume a view of the current ForEx environment, which is quite challenging right now. And we do believe that it -- in terms of our initial assumptions, it's probably costing us, in revenue, about 1 point to 1.5 points in growth as we go into the year. A few interesting things, while about 40% of our -- a little over 40% of our revenue is from foreign-sourced customers, we actually bill in dollars for about 80% of our revenue. So we're not that -- the exposure that we have on the revenue side is actually quite limited. And the major currencies there would be the euro, the sterling and the rupee. And then on the other side, we do have some expense exposures that we need to monitor and stay on top of. And just as a reminder, we have close to 8,000 associates in India, and so, obviously, a movement in the rupee can have a significant impact on our expense base.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just coming back to the question on the margins relative to the legal costs. I understand you said you still obviously have some remaining lawsuits and so forth out there on the private side. So just 2 parts to this. One, I guess, can you just give us an update on what's remaining on the legal side? And then if there's any way to just sort of quantify the relative exposure in the cost base on what you've settled and it's going to sort of get out of the cost base versus what's remaining?", "John F. Callahan", "Look, there's -- I think right now, relative, we have about 2 dozen cases outstanding, a good number of them outside of the United States. Nothing is really pending for trial right now. So we'll continue to monitor and work through those. But if there's opportunities to pragmatically resolve those issues, I would just point to today's release. There were -- there was a charge that we took for $35 million that addressed settlement-related issues with a good number of cases. So while there may be -- I don't think the financial exposure is quite any way is relative to some of the issues -- other issues that were resolved in the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg -- or from Vincent Hung, Autonomous.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research LLP", "Just a couple of questions. So the first one, sorry, just to go back on the legal front. Within the full year guidance, can you just give us like a rough sense of like what percentage of legal cost reduction you're baking in, like 50%, 20%, et cetera?", "John F. Callahan", "No. We -- all I'd like to say is that we do believe it's going to make a solid contribution to the ongoing margin expansion within Ratings. But that all being said, it's quite likely we're going to spend a little bit more money in the area of compliance and risk management. But net-net, we do overall believe it's going to make a significant contribution to future margin expansion.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research LLP", "Okay. And just on the cost reductions. So if I'm comparing the slide that you gave versus the slide that you gave at Investor Day, I don't see anything on data acquisition cost anymore or technology leverage. Is that just now baked into restructuring or has that already been taken?", "John F. Callahan", "There was -- in the area of technology, there is some savings that's baked into procurement. So just to kind of simplify the message, there were places and areas of technology where we had some opportunities to leverage our scale to reduce the number of the supplier -- of some suppliers who are using some key areas of software development. And that's providing some savings. So they -- we see -- as a reminder, back on Investor Day, the purpose of that slide was to lay out the target and to inform investors the various different places where we were going to look for savings. And now that we have done more of the work, I think this -- what the slide today gives you a better representation of what we actually expect to realize.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Craig Huber, Huber Research Partners.", "Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC", "My first question has to do with the Indices business. Can you just explain, if you would, why the Indices revenue growth slowed in the fourth quarter versus the trend you saw in the third quarter? And also, why it was down sequentially, if you would?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, part of it was the -- Craig, we -- this is related a little bit to that impairment charge we took a year ago in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of '13. So we did lose a license. So that did -- and that really did not start to impact the P&L at all until the third quarter, and then more meaningfully in the fourth. And I suspect it's also going to be a bit of a drag as we go into the first part of next year. Overall, in terms of the underlying performance of the business, we were actually quite pleased with the way the business finished the year. And assets under management actually ended up a bit ahead of our expectations.", "Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC", "And then also on the debt side, could you just help investors understand how much leverage, on a relative EBITDA, can you put on the balance sheet if you want to buy back stock or through acquisitions and then not hurt your investment-grade credit rating? I mean, how far can you go here, please? And which -- along those lines, what's your debt target ratio forecast?", "John F. Callahan", "Well, I mean, I think -- let's put this in terms of -- as a leverage multiple. So somewhere between 2.5x to 3x EBITDA. So I think that would be sort of the range, I think, that we can comfortably stay solidly investment grade.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Simmons, Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Robert Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I'm stepping in for Joe Foresi. I was wondering if you could give us just any indication of what you're expecting on the margin front across all businesses, but in particular, in the Ratings business?", "John F. Callahan", "We don't historically give such business-by-business margin on guidance at this point. I would point back that overall, on a consolidated basis, we do expect margin expansion at the consolidated level of at least 125 basis points. But just to put a little bit more color on it, it's hard to achieve that if Ratings particularly does not make some contribution, just kind of given its overall size in the portfolio. On the other hand, if you'd like to go maybe to the other extreme, it's kind of hard to really challenge our Indices business to kind of significantly expand their margins when they're already at 63% or 64%. So I do think there's -- I think there is sort of a range of opportunity that we're mindful as we start to build our overall margin expectations for the business.", "Robert Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And can you give me color on your decision-making process on how you decided to settle all of these big issues that are out there?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Well, we don't normally give a lot of details about our negotiation strategies. But as we've said in our materials that we issued, this was a time when given the -- where we were in the discovery process and the overall litigation process, it was to the benefit of all parties to resolve these issues and move on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo Securities.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So a couple of questions. First was, I wanted to ask if there was something that you could do to -- or you're working on to lessen the impact of the settlement in terms of tax deductibility, insurance, use of overseas cash? And then on the Index business, I was going to ask if you could comment on the M&A environment and potential opportunities there that you are thinking about.", "John F. Callahan", "Just on the -- if I was going to limit my comments more narrowly in terms of the legal regulatory settlements to just the Department of Justice, the items with the 19 states and CalPERS, the effective tax rate on those charges is a little less than 20% or high teens, roughly in that area. So there is some tax deductibility. It's not total. The -- right now, we don't see a need, and we're not confident the most -- the best economic choice is to use offshore cash, even though that cash is available. Just kind of given the cost of funding that we can access through our credit facility, that's probably the more pragmatic solution for us if we need a bit of funding here. So that's probably more -- that's probably the path we're going to go down.", "Douglas L. Peterson", "And on the overall environment, if you want to talk about the business environment of the Index business and potential M&A. As we've mentioned in our prior disclosures, as well as our discussions about the Index business, we continue to focus on international expansion. As you know, we set up deals last year in Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Korea, Taiwan and then across many African nations. We think that this is a secular trend. It's one that we should be heavily focused on. And that also includes building relationships with exchanges around the world. And then another area that we believe is going to be growth is in fixed income indices. So our major growth focus is on international expansion and on fixed income indices. Our base case is based on organic growth and investments using our own platform. And clearly, if there were opportunities or different properties were available, we would always like to take a look. But we don't comment on any speculation about our acquisition activities.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim McHugh, William Blair.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I just want to ask about the comment about seeing 3/4 of those -- that $140 million, I guess, by the end of 2015. I guess, just to clarify. Do you expect that to flow through the income statement or, I guess, actions taken and I guess to eventually realize that? Just trying to get how -- a sense of whether we're going to -- we've seen that in your numbers for '15 or it's more future years?", "John F. Callahan", "Yes. No, look, I think we will -- of the $140 million, we'll realize 75% of that by the end of 2015. So to be clear, we started -- as we started to work these programs, we started to get some benefits last year in '14. And so there's a bit of a benefit that we've already realized in our numbers. We do think in '15 -- and '15 is probably the year we'll get the most benefit, so we do think we'll get approaching half, maybe not quite, of the benefit in this year. And that ties very much to the guidance that were given on ongoing margin expansion. And we expect we'll continue to get some additional benefit as we go into '16. And some of these things are timing. Just to give you one real good example, we already have started to get some savings from our exit of our headquarters building at 1221 Sixth Avenue. But we still have employees there. We won't be in a position to shut that down until later this year. Once we do that, then we'll have completed that program. So we started to feather some of these savings in. And we think what will -- we're in good shape to both exceed the target and to make this a meaningful contribution to our margin expansion plan.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then just I heard the comments about the quarter, but I guess thinking for -- on Platts, just given the price of oil, can you elaborate at all on kind of the -- how you think about that and what you're hearing back from customers, given some of them are probably pressured right now?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Yes, that's one of the areas we're spending a lot of time looking at. In the Platts business, we're looking obviously at the different parts of the entire value chain. We have a very small portion of our business is with people that are wildcatters and in the fracking and shale activity industry that represents about 3% of our total business. But what we're also seeing during this period is that we are having very high retention rates of our services as we normally do. There is a lot of demand for information about oil prices and oil fundamentals, petroleum products, et cetera, in this kind of environment. But we believe that we're well positioned to serve the markets and serve their information needs. But at the same time, we're building flexibility into our workforce and into our planning for 2015, in case there is any sort of downturn in volumes in the business that we see.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Ed Atorino, Benchmark.", "Edward J. Atorino - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just want to congratulate you for sort of cleaning the slate. Any little pieces left that remain to be resolved? Or is it basically done?", "Douglas L. Peterson", "Ed, well, thank you for being on the call, and thank you for the question. What we're really looking for is now taking advantage of the excellent work that's been done the last couple years to rationalize the portfolio, to put in place a culture of high-quality customer engagement, of focusing on growth, of ensuring that we have a best-in-class control, and that this is the kind of platform that'll allow us to continue to grow the company and deliver results. So this is really what we're all about. It's being about our customers, having great engaged employees and delivering for our shareholders.", "Well, let me thank everyone for joining us. We are very excited about our prospects for 2015. As you've heard us, we think that we're well positioned for growth and that we've got a great focus on providing superior customer engagement, looking at international opportunities and very, very importantly, focused on our margin expansion. That's something we've got a track record over the last couple years. We want to continue to deliver that. I look forward to updating all of you throughout the year, and thank you again very much.", "Operator", "That concludes today's morning's call.

Thank you for joining us for McGraw Hill Financial's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our results. I trust you've all had a chance to review the release. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management.

Doug?", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you, Chip. Good morning everyone and welcome to the call. I am pleased to report that we are off to a good start for 2015. Let me begin by reviewing some of the highlights from the quarter. The company reported strong revenue growth of 6% despite a negative impact from foreign exchange rates that reduced the growth rate by 2%. Every business unit delivered growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit. Revenue growth combined with progress on our productivity initiatives lead to a 380 basis points improvement in our adjusted operating profit margin. We resumed our share purchase program with 1.1 million shares repurchased in the quarter.", "We made changes to our compensation programs aligning them more closely with investor interest by eliminating employee stock option grants and instead utilizing restricted stock grants and deferred cash. Our legal team continued to resolve legacy litigation matters including receiving a dismissal of the Corte dei Conti matter in Italy. You will recall this was potential Euro 234 billion claim from an Italian prosecutor that we referred to on our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call.", "And finally, Ashu Suyash was named as the managing director and CEO of Crisil effective June. Ashu brings a strong professional track record in the financial services sector and proven leadership skill and we look forward to having her join Crisil.", "As we look to 2015, we\u2019re encouraged by the economic landscape before us. The US economy continues to strengthen albeit in fits and starts. The labor market is showing solid momentum and we expect continued job creation coupled with lower oil prices to enable consumer spending to fuel additional GDP growth.", "In Europe, we expect GDP to expand 1.1% due to lower oil prices, quantitative easing and the strong US dollar. And finally we expect Asia-Pacific investment and borrowing activity to remain sound. Caution is warranted however for a number of reasons. The US dollar is strong, interest rates are volatile with negative rates appearing in Europe and markets in the US are in a rate [increase watch].", "Geopolitical concerns continue in Greece and the Ukraine and emerging markets credit conditions could weaken due to lower commodity prices, sharp declines in currency value and the strong dollar. Overall we expect global GDP to grow 3.5% this year, a positive environment overall for our businesses.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our first-quarter results. Revenue increased 6%, adjusted operating profit increased 18%, adjusted operating margin increased 380 basis points, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 25%. Despite the challenge of a strong US dollar, the company delivered healthy revenue growth with 10% domestic growth and 1% international growth.", "Jack will discuss the impact to the company from foreign exchange in his remarks. Adjusted segment costs were well contained in the quarter due to tight cost control and progress on our productivity initiatives. All of our business units delivered revenue growth and increased adjusted operating profit. Only S&P Dow Jones Indices did not report improved margins and that was to a difficult comparison with a one-time revenue increase recorded in the year ago quarter.", "Now let me turn to the individual businesses and I will start with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. In the first quarter, revenue increased 6%, adjusted operating profit grew 19%, and the adjusted operating margin increased 480 basis points to 47%. While revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange it had a negligible impact on operating profit. S&P Ratings Services continues to make progress in improving margins. Reduced headcount from recent restructuring was the primary contributor to this quarter\u2019s improvement. Partially offsetting this progress were costs associated with efforts related to Dodd Frank implementation and other regulatory requirements. ", "Moving onto the next slide, transaction revenue increased from 43% to 48% of total revenue. Non-transaction revenue decreased due to a strong US dollar and a decline in entity credit rating revenue and slower client acquisition in Q1 2014. Transaction revenue grew resulting from increased corporate public debt finance issuance offset somewhat by weakness in bank loans.", "The leverage loan market experienced a 51% decline in new issue volume versus the first quarter of 2014. One of the causes of the decline in bank loans is the decrease in leverage buyouts. [LBO] related activity was the lowest since 2009 with market participants discouraged by the regulatory environment.", "If we turn to issuance, the recent trends in US and European issuance did benefit our businesses. First-quarter issuance in the US was quite strong across all sectors. Investment grade increased 24%. In the US the improvement in corporate issuance was largely due to a 45% increase in industrials issuance as financial services only increased 2%. Large debt financed M&A transactions also contributed to the lift in issuance.", "In addition, a continued thirst for yield has enabled corporate issuers across the rating spectrum to tap the capital market, extending maturities at beneficial pricing and terms. High yield increased 39%, public finance was up 61% over an unusually weak first-quarter in 2014. Sequentially public issuance was flat, albeit at an elevated level as local government continued to refinance maturing debt.", "Structured finance issuance, while up 21% versus the first quarter 2014, is consistent with levels seen throughout most of 2014. Of particular note was strength in ABS as auto securitization remained robust. In Europe, while there was a strong sequential recovery year-over-year issuance comparisons were mostly negative. There is an increasing universe of government debt trading with a negative yield or fixed rate return of barely above zero. This is due to the European Central Bank\u2019s aggressive stimulus policy. This has resulted in yield hungry European bond investors buying reverse Yankee bonds as a growing number of European companies turned to the other side of the Atlantic for their financing needs. By the way reverse Yankee bonds are counted as US issuance in revenue.", "Further in Europe, investment-grade decreased 9% and high yield declined 5%. Structured issuance was one of the bright spots however, increasing 23% thanks to ABS and the surge in United Kingdom RMBS. Note that from a revenue perspective bond activity was not as positive issuance might suggest as the growth in the number of issues did not keep pace with the growth in the par value of issuance as deal prices increased in most asset classes.", "There is a perception among some investors that corporate debt is unusually high and issuance likely unstable. Periodically we have provided data that suggest otherwise, including that generated in our annual analysis of debt maturities. This chart illustrates data from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services annual global debt maturities study. Each study shows the upcoming five years of debt maturities.", "Over the course of the year there was no change to the total debt maturing. Both last year\u2019s study and the most recent study depict total debt maturities for the following five years totaling $8.9 trillion. These data help provide confidence that corporate issuance will continue in the coming years.", "Now let me turn to S&P Capital IQ. Revenue grew 6%, segment operating profit grew 18% and operating margin increased 200 basis points to 19.5%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. Revenue growth was consistent both in the US and outside the US. Two particular highlights during the quarter were continued low teens growth of S&P Capital IQ desktop users and the product retention rates across the segment that reached 92%.", "S&P Capital IQ is known foremost for the breath and consistency of its data. To enhance our data even further we established a partner with Klooks, a recognized source of Brazilian corporate financial information, to offer financial data on more than 10,000 unlisted private companies in Brazil. Let me add a bit more color on revenue growth in the three business lines of S&P Capital IQ.", "S&P Capital IQ desktop and enterprise solutions revenue increased 10% principally as a result of low teen increase in desktop revenue. S&P Credit Solutions revenue increased 6% due primarily to single digit growth in ratings express. In the smallest category, S&P Capital IQ markets intelligence revenue decreased 12% overall. While global markets\u2019 intelligence continued to deliver double-digit growth declines in equity research services and the shutdown of [SMR] in Europe more than offset those gains.", "Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, [Indiscernible] mutual fund and data license revenue, which all increased. Operating profit increased 4%. This quarterly comparison was impacted by a one-time revenue increase of approximately $12 million associated with refined revenue recognition for certain ETF products in the year ago quarter. While the comparison was difficult the results were still solid with an operating profit margin of 66.6%.", "Highlights during the quarter included an aggressive expansion of our fixed income business and establishment of a strategic index agreement with NZX Limited in New Zealand. If we turn to the key business drivers, the ETF industry experienced record first quarter inflows of $97 billion. However, much of this was directed to non-US ETFs where our position is not as strong as the US. In the long run this is still positive. We believe that once investors place funds into passive investment, these funds tend to stay in passive investment and then they shift between various ETFs based on asset allocation models and decisions.", "ETF AUMs associated with our indices increased 22% to $810 billion versus the end of first-quarter 2014 with approximately three quarters of this growth coming from inflows. While year-over-year growth was meaningful this AUM decreased sequentially from $832 billion at the end of 2014 as ETF flows moved to products offering European and non-US exposure.", "Mutual fund AUMs associated with our indices reached $1.1 trillion, an increase of 14% versus first-quarter 2014. Derivative trading licensing, generally the most volatile portion of revenue, diverged during the quarter with over-the-counter volumes increasing and exchange traded activity decreasing. The follow up from the LIBOR scandal has elevated the importance of both objectives and independently governed indices and benchmarks. We see this as an exceptional opportunity for S&P Dow Jones Indices to build investor confidence in the fixed income markets by developing factor based income benchmarks.", "During the quarter we announced an important expansion of our fixed-income business. Our objective is clear, to be the premier provider of financial market indices across all asset classes including all bond types throughout the world. S&P Dow Jones Indices already publishes over 500 fixed-income indices globally covering municipal bonds, preferred stock, corporate bonds, credit default swaps and senior loans amongst others. We are the third largest provider of fixed income indices for the global ETF market with approximately 30 billion AUM linked to our indices.", "The flagship S&P aggregate bond index family will cover over 20,000 individual securities with the ultimate goal of launching thousands of maturity and sector based indices. The S&P US aggregate bond index was launched in January. It is a broad, comprehensive market valuated index designed to measure the performance of the investment grade US fixed income market. And finally recognizing the strategic importance of exchange relationships, S&P has formed a number of unique and dynamic alliances with exchanges in various markets since 1998. The latest agreement with NZX Limited puts us at the centre of a series of initiatives to facilitate greater investor access to the New Zealand market. We are committed to raising the global profile of the NZX indices with our well recognized marketing and international commercialization capability.", "Onto Commodities & Commercial Markets, as a reminder, McGraw Hill Construction was sold and its results moved to discontinued operations. Thus our financial for 2015 and 2014 do not include these results. Revenue grew 7% as both Platts and JD Power delivered high single digit revenue growth. Segment operating profit grew 23%. Due to solid revenue growth and tight cost control the operating margin increased 510 basis points to 38%.", "During the quarter, Platts continued to grow revenue despite low commodity prices. As we have seen in recent quarters the newer areas of metals and agriculture had the highest revenue growth rate. Global trading services revenue increased primarily due to license revenue from the steel index derivative activity at the Singapore Exchange. Platts added petrochemicals to its suite of forward curbs in oil, natural gas, coal and power. These new forward curves include a range of aromatic petrochemicals such as benzene and naphtha and can be used as references for evaluating contractual assets and liability measuring P&L from changes in market prices and making more informed risk management decisions.", "We often talk about keeping benchmarks fresh, relevant, and delivered in a user-friendly manner. Here are a couple of examples. Platts recently introduced a faster method for delivering real time global commodity prices, with historical and reference data via Platts Market Data Direct. The new improved version transfers Platts data straight into subscribers proprietary systems providing need-to-know prices at the moment of publication. Customers can focus on what is most important to them.", "Another example is an update to Platts dated Brent benchmark, one of the world\u2019s most important and widely used price assessments. To further strengthen and enhance its long-term viability, the cargo loading period was widened enabling the benchmark to reflect an additional 5 to 6 days of supply, responding to the reality that oilfields decline and supply over time.", "Finally, JD Power delivered high single digit revenue growth led by strong activity in the US auto sector. Global services industries and advertising licensing revenue also contributed to growth. During the quarter JD Power launched a new product, Voice of Experience, a holistic solution enabled by an innovative technology platform designed for businesses to optimize their customer experience and drive financial results.", "VoX displays interactive data in an intuitive user interface for all levels of an organization to determine how to improve the customer experience and improve loyalty, advocacy, sales and service.

Our company continues to be aligned around very important themes, strengthening customer and stakeholder engagement, accelerating our international growth, sustaining our margin expansion and maintaining discipline in capital allocation, and fostering a robust risk and compliance culture to manage and mitigate risk throughout the company.", "With that I want to thank all of you for joining the call this morning, and now I\u2019m going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "John Callahan", "Thank you, Doug. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I want to briefly add some color on several items related to first-quarter financial performance and then we will open it up to your questions. First I will recap key consolidated financial results and review certain adjustments to earnings that were recorded in the quarter. Second I will discuss the impact of foreign exchange changes on revenue, and third I will highlight balance sheet changes, free cash flow and return of capital.", "So let us start with the first-quarter income statement. Overall these were good results, especially the continuing momentum in margin improvement. Revenue grew 6% despite the challenging headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted consolidated operating profit grew 16% with all four business units contributing to this growth. Continued progress on our productivity initiatives fuelled this growth. We also realized the benefit from foreign exchange, which impacted expenses from our operations outside of the United States.", "Within the quarter, the positive benefit to expenses from ForEx offset the negative impact to revenue. Unallocated expenses decreased 3%. The tax rate on an adjusted basis was 32%. We had a one-time benefit from a prior year item that impacted the rate. For the balance of the year, we continued to guide to an approximately 33% rate. ", "Adjusted net income increased 24% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 25% to $1.09. The average diluted shares outstanding decreased by almost 1 million shares versus a year ago as share repurchase activity offset the dilutive impact of shares granted for equity related compensation.", "Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Overall the adjustments in the quarter were limited. In total, pre-tax adjustments to earnings from continuing operations resulted in a gain of $6 million during the quarter. This consisted of 35 million in settlement-related insurance recoveries, partially offset by 29 million of legal settlement charges. Let me provide more color on the impact of foreign exchange on results.", "The strong dollar is having a pronounced impact on corporate America. The impact on McGraw Hill Financial is mitigated somewhat since approximately one half of our revenue outside of the United States is invoiced in US dollars. During the quarter we reported a strong 10% increase in domestic revenue and a 1% increase in international revenue. On a constant currency basis, international revenue increased 6%. In total, our consolidated revenue increased 6%. On a constant currency basis the total company revenue increased 8%. The business with the largest impact was Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, which accounted for approximately 80% of the total foreign exchange impact on revenue.", "Now let us turn to the balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, we had almost $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately $1 billion is held outside of the United States. The decrease from the end of 2014 is primarily due to the payment of legal settlement of approximately $1.6 billion during the first quarter.", "In order to meet this significant US cash requirement, the company incurred 365 million of short-term debt through commercial paper issuance and by tapping our revolving credit facility. We continue to have approximately 800 million of long-term debt. Our free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $1.4 billion. While the legal settlements were recorded in the income statement in the fourth quarter of 2014, almost all of the cash was paid out in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, the first-quarter has stepped up cash requirements for annual incentive compensation payments.", "During the first quarter, we resumed the company\u2019s share purchase program and bought 1.1 million shares. Share repurchase has been and remains an important component of our capital allocation program, and we will continue to selectively repurchase shares under our remaining share purchase authorization of 44.5 million shares.", "Going forward, we believe we have the balance sheet capacity to continue to make investments that strengthen the portfolio, including acquisitions, maintain our long history of dividend growth\u2026 and as appropriate continue our share repurchase activity.", "In closing I would like to reiterate that our 2015 guidance remain unchanged with mid single digit revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.45. The specific elements of our guidance can be seen on this slide. We continue to focus on creating growth and driving performance. We\u2019re off to a good start in 2015 and are encouraged by the performance of our businesses, but we\u2019re mindful of the broader macroeconomic challenges that we continue to fit.", "With that let me turn back the call over to Jeff for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Thanks Jack. [Operator Instructions]", "The first question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs, you may ask your question.", "Andre Benjamin", "Thank you, good morning. First I was wondering if you can may be discuss how your client conversations are making you feel about the pipeline and outlook at this point in the quarter, we all know what some of the risks are and you spoke with them, maybe you can help handicap maybe arrange or how you\u2019re thinking about the service there?", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you Andre, this is Doug. Just wanted to give you a little bit of feel for issuance overall, if you don\u2019t mind. The first quarter as many of the quarter have been recently there was lot of different components, as I mentioned in my comments, the U.S. industrials was up 45% although the number of issues themselves was basically flat. Public finance was up dramatically where financial institution, financial services was quite low. In Europe as you know the financial services was down, Severance was down and both European corporate investment grade and non investment grade high yield were also down.", "What we\u2019re hearing is that the impact in Europe let me start there in Europe, we\u2019re expecting that there will be continued long run development of the capital market it\u2019s one of the priority that the [indiscernible] they have a capital markets initiative which is underway it\u2019s to develop the capital market union. That\u2019s very important but the banks have been holding more depth on their balance sheet they\u2019re making loans on holding them more than had in prior quarters. They have a lot of liquidity, they\u2019ve finished their AQR and they\u2019ve also seen a very, very inexpensive financing with the zero interest rate policy.", "In the U.S. we\u2019re seeing a lot of M&A activity even though LBOs are down there is a lot of M&A activity and if you have seen there is a lot of very large transactions which have hit the market. Generally speaking it\u2019s very early in the year for us to give any kind of forecast but we\u2019re hearing continued M&A activity, U.S. corporate finance activity as corporations continue to take advantage of low interest rates and in addition to that the U.S. market even as we\u2019ve said it\u2019s fits and starts and starting that picked up with the financial, with the markets being very attractive for especially industrial company.", "So net, net early near for us to give you guidance but we\u2019re seeing a lot of very promising aspect to the market especially in the U.S. and especially with the market in the Europe and banking of financial market there.", "Andre Benjamin", "Thanks. And then capital like you, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about where you believe you\u2019re taking share to support the strong growth in desktop \u2013 is it coming from the stub side of the other three desktop players or some of the ones that are small in themselves or you actually seeing some growth in the bottom market?", "Doug Peterson", "The broader aspect is just growth from the market there is a lot of penetration internationally from banks that have not been customers before. There is a little bit of share battle going on that most of that per share battle for new installations as opposed to people wining in from each other battle, from each other bid. We\u2019re very encouraged by the uptick of S&P capital like you, it\u2019s an incredible valuable tool, one of the other areas that we\u2019re excited about is that the Desktop is more and more people uses and it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s say junior bankers start to grow in their careers they take it with them as they expand it to more senior roles. And we\u2019re also planning many new uses for S&P capital IQ Desktop that goes beyond just the analyst Desktop. So, we\u2019re seeing new markets and new opportunities growth so it\u2019s not just taking share it\u2019s also expanding into international market.", "Andre Benjamin", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays, your line is open.", "Manav Patnaik", "Yes, good morning gentlemen. My first question, Jack I know you like to be conservative but around, with the guidance being unchanged I was wondering within the parameters if anything has moved around I mean it seems like the margin expand especially with S&P with a lot better than we\u2019ve expected maybe revenue growth down. Can you give us a little more color on maybe some of the moving pieces there?", "John Callahan", "Like we said we think this is the very \u2013 this is the good start to the year, but it only is the one quarter so it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re keeping our existing guidance in place we think it\u2019s a prudent move here. In terms of things of how they\u2019re playing out relative in going expectations I think we\u2019re maybe encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making on the margin so I think that is a positive relative incoming. Expectations on the other side I think some of the ForEx headwinds maybe of a little bit more challenging but that we\u2019re also encouraged by the sustained organic growth.", "On balance side I think we would call it so far so good and we\u2019re optimistic about the balance of the year.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay, thank you. On your balance sheet I mean obviously you raise the short term that\u2019s longer term can you talk about like if we should expect like appetite lever up \u2013 buyback comment on the pipeline how it should be?", "John Callahan", "Look, we initiate our share repurchase program and we look to \u2013 we\u2019re going to look to selectively continue that as we go forward and we also recognize that we\u2019ve more flexibility and how we manage the balance sheet. And we\u2019ll look to consider other options in terms of perhaps raises and capital from time to time to lock into very attractive conditions that remain up there. So, we\u2019re encouraged by the fact that we\u2019ve more flexibility in terms of how we manage the balance sheet going forward.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "John Callahan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from of Alex Kramm with UBS, you may ask your question.", "Alex Kramm", "Hi good morning, just wanted to come back to the impressive margin expansion on the ratings business, curious about sustainability here, I know the first quarter obviously had the legal resolution, so to some degree our legal cost already coming out or what else can we expect here over the course of the year and then same thing goes for maybe some of the initiatives on the cost cutting in that business in particular where are we on that end and what else is playing out over the course of the year. So again, just we\u2019re the puts and takes on the margins when you think about the remainder of the year?", "John Callahan", "I think the benefit that we\u2019re seeing primarily in Q1 is some of the restructuring actions that we took in the third and fourth quarter of the year ago that\u2019s having impact in Q1. We\u2019re beginning to see not having a big impact on margins in Q1 but we\u2019re starting to see moderation in legal expense, we do anticipate that will bake a larger contribution as we go across the balance of the year.", "On the other hand we\u2019re spending a bit more money in areas of compliance particularly with the new regulations, so we\u2019re investing there to make sure that we maintain a very prudent risk in compliance environment. And we\u2019re selectively looking to also spend in technology to further harden our global processes. On balance we feel good about the margin progress that we\u2019ve made and we\u2019re benefitting I think from the restructuring from year ago and I do think the outlook as I mentioned for legal looks more promising than obviously a year ago.", "Alex Kramm", "Okay, very good. And then secondly, maybe just going to capital Q4 minute obviously doing as well, I think you said in the past not so long ago when there was a change in management that you might be little bit more focused on driving results sooner versus just building a big platform. So, can you just talk about if that\u2019s already driving some of the recent growth that we had, have there been changes of really focusing to getting results now or is there still more to come in terms of some of the way you interfacing with client and how you\u2019re offering products?", "John Callahan", "The answer is actually all of the above, we\u2019ve put a very important emphasis on our profitability on our margin in that business to drive productivity but not at the expense of investing and covering customer, so we have intensive effort to build our sales force, our customer engagement, our service level and we\u2019re also investing in a multiyear project to upgrade our technology so that we can continue to have state of the art technology and delivery and stay ahead with our stay along with or at least ahead of our most of our major competitors. So it\u2019s really been a program to in a methodically take a step back and look at the business, look at the customers, look at their needs, look at all of the areas where we serve them best and how we can serve them best and how we can serve them better, but also doing that with a project where we\u2019re looking at all of our costs, all of our inputs to ensure that we\u2019re doing in a way that\u2019s more productive and I think you can see it\u2019s paying off. We have excellent retention rates we\u2019ve been growing our sales in Desktops and in Enterprise fees and at the same time we\u2019ve been able to invest in growing and we\u2019re seeing improvement in the margin.", "So, I think it\u2019s a good story [indiscernible] answered has been an excellent leader and is managing all of that and I\u2019m very, very pleased with her performance.", "Alex Kramm", "Fantastic thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair, you may ask your question.", "Timothy McHugh", "Thanks. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more I guess in terms of the weekend oil prices and I guess in particular maybe as you went on in the quarter I know some businesses that are not completely like the prices as meant, but some of like tier 2 information services for the oil and energy industry. I\u2019ve seen customer decisions get weaker I guess as you progress further into oil prices lower but it doesn\u2019t seem to be showing up for you for plat, so just curious if you could elaborate a little bit more what the conversations are like with client?", "John Callahan", "I think the point on the plat we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made in the first quarter here. Now just as a reminder while obviously oil and petroleum is there, is our largest business it only represents two-thirds of the business, so we do have and it has been decision on our decision to broaden out our commodity exposure here, so that would be point one.", "You know point two, within the core oil and petroleum market admittedly there are a lot of \u2013 there is profit pressure on the industry that all being said, we\u2019ve had very good results in our renewals and I do think it\u2019s perhaps costing us a couple points of growth in the market and maybe just costing us a couple of growth points, but in general we\u2019re still growing and we\u2019re highly encouraged with the high single digit progress that we\u2019ve made overall in the business so far this year. I think this is just evidence of these benchmarks in trench in our customers\u2019 business models. These prices that we put out are buried in their invoicing systems, these customers can\u2019t invoice without these prices, they can\u2019t value inventory in many cases. So, if the small frac goes out of business we may lose that customer but that\u2019s a very, very, very tiny portion of the business, so this is the classic example of the need for benchmarks.", "I want to add that one of the reason you say 510 basis point improvement in the margin in the commercial and commodities margin is that we\u2019ve also proactively positioned ourselves for potentially weaker markets. We wanted to be very cautious about certain investments that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not investing in the business but we felt that we needed to get ahead of a potential slowdown in the market so we have also positioned ourselves with some flexibility to ensure that we continue management business responsibility.", "Timothy McHugh", "Okay great and then on the index business in particular the 16 commodity talked about new launch kind of an aggressive expansion of that with the U.S. aggregate index in the quarter. Two parts to that one I guess does that make you \u2013 are you more focused on organically expanding in fixed income at this point or acquisition still possibility there and secondly I guess the aggressive expansion is it something we should notice as we think about the margins for that business going forward I guess how aggressive does aggressive mean?", "John Callahan", "I think that what we are looking at is you saw the we are at number three in that market with $30 billion position in ETF so relative to the larger market and the equity market even commodity market ETF and fixed income industries are actually still very small portion of the overall financial markets. Bonds are difficult and this really get prices for we have been working on lot of ways to ensure that we have continuous bond pricing whether they are from market prices or evaluated prices and getting that infrastructure in place is critical to being able to have a very active liquid ETF and fixed industries market. So we are in this for the long haul, we look at the big trends of when you meet with asset distributor and asset allocators, they all talk about the need to have certain types of fixed income solutions that aren't just individual bonds and so are very encouraged by that. We are also encouraged by the facts that banks are probably struggling with their after the LIBOR scandals with their ability to continue to manage benchmarks inside of their businesses. They might be non-core or they might not really be a business that it makes a lot of sense for them to be in. so to answer you first question then, we are going to grow this on our own. We see this is a very important organic activity although as I said starting from a very small base. But if there are opportunities for us to buy businesses and buy assets we would definitely be interested as we have always been in ways we can do tuck-ins or filling our capabilities.", "Douglas Peterson", "And one more point on your question on the margin aspect of this is that some of these investments already in the margin that\u2019s\u2019 already in the result, so we have kind of built out this team. We have spent some money on information towards this, build over some period of time. So I think some of that capabilities already in place.", "Timothy McHugh", "Okay, Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Bird with FBR, you may ask your question.", "William Bird", "Yes, just two questions. One are you considering any strategies for tapping the value of your under-earning non-US cash and then second I guess along the line of M&A could you just refresh us on kind of the criteria you apply and you appetite to do something larger thank you?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, first of all we are always looking for opportunities to our offshore cash, the first priority offshore which has been little different than cash that's how domestically is for offshore acquisition. And we continue to look for those sorts of opportunities. We completed clips last year for plat which was in the north America which was the complement and earlier move we have made in north America with [indiscernible] kind of built out of European position in natural gas and we are continuing to look for those opportunities and that will be our first choice in terms of delays to deploy that cash. From time to time there are some relatively efficient ways perhaps to access some of that cash and bring it back. We look at that consistently but like I said our first priority is growth. In terms of your question back to M&A I think our track record demonstrates we are disciplined when we look at particularly larger M&A sorts of opportunities. First thing we are looking for is growth. We are looking for growth that is accretive to our existing position but at the same time we are highly disciplined to ensure that we are also going to be able to deliver the synergies that would deliver incremental shareholder value that would justify the investment. And that got a bit of challenging these days given the somewhat high evaluation that appeared to be out there for some of the more attractive properties but we continue to do the hard work to look for the right sorts of choices for us going forward.", "William Bird", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research. You may ask your question.", "Craig Huber", "Yes good morning. Few questions. My first one housekeeping question maybe I missed this, but what are you guys budgeting the impact and the revenue in cost for foreign exchange rate for full year please?", "John Callahan", "Look I think the impact the impact year-on-year that we saw in Q1 which is about two growth point from the revenue point of view. We anticipate going forward maybe get year-on-year a bit more challenging in the second and third quarter and then the year-end-year sort of impact starts to moderate a bit. That's built into our forward guidance so we do think we have our exposure, it\u2019s pretty well covered and how we have thought about our outlook for the balance of the year.", "Craig Huber", "What on the cost side given how much your revenue obviously in U.S. dollar?", "John Callahan", "I do think we \u2013 there was not a lot of bottom line impact. In fact there was a modest benefit in foreign exchange all in, in the first quarter. We are not anticipating that sort of positive impact over the balance of the year although there was some balance sheet that produced that in Q1. I think we would love to have a modest negative over the next few quarters but very manageable overall in terms of our outlook. ", "Craig Huber", "And then, also you touched on this briefly but on the share buybacks just curious here your updated thoughts how much leverage if you wanted to put more debt behind your buyback share, could you add roughly couple terms of leverage you are not impact investment grid?", "John Callahan", "Well certainly, we have lot of flexibility in our balance sheet right now and we are \u2013 as I mentioned earlier it\u2019s nice to have the flexibility to consider those options and as we go forward we would look to leverage our balance sheet both to broaden our portfolio and add attractive asset and if we can't find those that add shareholders value we would love to sustain and perhaps increase our share repurchase program but I think if you look on a multi-year basis we have been pretty aggressive in that area and yes we continue to look at that going forward. Thank you. ", "Craig Huber", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. You may ask your question.", "Vincent Hung", "Hi, good morning. ", "Douglas Peterson", "Morning.", "Vincent Hung", "First question is can you quantify how much progress you have made on the custom initiative against the one 40 million target?", "John Callahan", "Yes, I would say so far in the run rate we have realized well over half of that so in that run rate and I think by the end of the year our run rate will have achieved 75% with so by the end of 2015 so I think we are very encouraged with the progress so far as I mentioned I think margins performances has been a very positive development as we come into the year.", "Vincent Hung", "Okay. And last question is so the subscription revenues and the ratings expenses are down 2% year-over-year and [indiscernible] due to less new entities being added. Is the lack of new customer growth due to the slowdown in leverage lending?", "Douglas Peterson", "It's mostly due to the European the circumstances of the first quarter in Europe there was a lot less capital markets activity you could see it from the decrease in Europe. Let me find the numbers here exactly again. Yes there was a decrease of 9% of Europe corporate and European high yield was down 5% the total number of deals if you look at it on deals themselves is down over 15% in Europe in the first quarter. So there is a lot of liquidity in Europe and the banks themselves were lending as opposed to companies going into the capital markets that was the major reason why the entities you credit ratings were down.", "Vincent Hung", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Peter Appert", "Thanks. So Doug the margin performance of the ratings is very impressed obviously so I am wondering how much there is to do in terms of driving the margin and if you thought about what at an appropriate level of margin is that business?", "Douglas Peterson", "We haven't necessarily targeted a specific level of margin but we have been looking for margin improvement. As Jack mentioned earlier we are continuing to invest in our regulatory and with control processes and environment we have been looking at ways to enhance some of our product delivery, our process improvement which require technology investments. But at the same time we are doing in a way that we are more and more efficient all the time. We are looking at ways to have the right sort of teams, right sort of geographic balances etcetera. So we continue to hope that we can drive the margin even better than it is now but this is really something that we are actively managing and pursuing to continue to deliver better margin.", "Peter Appert", "Okay. And same thing on the CapEx Q side. I think you talked in the past about mid 20% margin. Can you remind if that's correct, is that the kind of target you are thinking about that business in long term?", "John Callahan", "That's a longer term target. If we were to look at with we still have a lot of investments that we are making right now that we will play out overtime but when we look at what we think could be kind of a natural rate for that business remember that we still have a couple of research businesses during that third bucket of products that are losing money or have not been profitable and so we are working on ways to peel some of them out. As I mentioned [indiscernible] doing a fantastic job to go through the businesses and look at them one by one product by product and what we do feel encouraged with the progress and the direction we are hitting there with the margins in fact its good across all of our businesses and we are very pleased with that progress.", "Peter Appert", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. You may ask your question.", "Doug Arthur", "Yes thanks. Doug you mentioned the one time revenue benefit in the industries business a year ago. I mean I am not just used to seeing AUM up 22% year-over-year you mentioned it was sort of down sequentially and at sort of mid-single digit revenue growth. So in your assessment nothing structurally has changed in this business in terms of pricing at this point?", "John Callahan", "No. not at all. There was I think if you recall last year we shifted some of our in the first quarter we had some of our ETF revenues were being recognized in the sense on a cash basis and we looked at them because of the performance and the predictability and the volumes we shifted them to being now on a accrual basis to move them all basically had one time gain of upfront at that $12 million so that's the main difference in the first quarter but structurally speaking the business is still continues to perform as it has been in the past. ", "Peter Appert", "Okay great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Morning. Yes, I just wanted a little bit more color on the fixed income rollout in the industries. You mentioned 30 billion AUM but I wondered if you can give us little color on how fast that's growing and also the expenses related to the rollout is sales and marketing the most important expense, how would you expect the index expenses to trend as you rollout fixed income industries. I mean it\u2019s actually down quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter.", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, so let me start Jack will also jump in so we think that fixed income rollout is one that we will \u2013 we think that it\u2019s going to require a couple of years to build. This isn't something which is built from a quarter-to-quarter but as I mentioned before we are seeing a lot of demand from when we speak with especially after allocators and people that are in asset management managers and people who are actually in the sale side of this business because they need products for retirements, for insurance that they really don't have to date. So this will be something if you look at the growth of the fixed of the equity -- you will see that they grew very slowly for maybe 15 or 20 years and then they just boomed and started to taking off. So I don't have any specific projections. We are in this for the long run. We think that we have the brand. We have the access to investors, we have got the right kind of controls and processes to manage this business professionally and so we are in this for the long run and something that we are willing to invest in so that we can have a dominant position.", "John Callahan", "I just meant that as I mentioned earlier from an expense point of view is that good days of that expense for this initiative is already in the P&L. We have fixed income team. We spend the money to have had for some time. The data necessary to deliver the products. So some of that is already in the run rate as we move forward as this business expand I do suspect we will add to that team over time particularly in areas like channel management as we start to run impact the market place but I wouldn't \u2013 at this point in time I wouldn't we wouldn't give any forward looking thought that is any significant change in the margins of the business at this moment on.", "John Callahan", "But let me just add that from the point of view of our overall strategy this is a business that really makes sense for us to invest in.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you. And then moving on to plat we are starting to hear some M&A in energy space. And I was wondering if that has impacted plats in any ways so far or do you anticipate M&A affecting plats in terms of maybe customers merger and buy less products or maybe you can just address that idea of M&A in the commodity segment.", "John Callahan", "Yes, that's always something that we are going to be watching out carefully. We have not seen any major impact on that from that so far but as I mentioned earlier we have positioned ourselves to have some flexibility with expenses we want to be very attentive to what are the developments in the market and so far we haven't seen that impact but it is something that we are watching for. Just two things I would add to that is \u2013 plat actually has very, very broad customer coverage so our exposure to any one or two customers in that business is actually what we have big customers our exposure is somewhat limited to any one or two particular customers and also to it a lot of some of these field that you may see is that sometimes there is also a curve out or skin out to create a new entity and that then create a new opportunity for us to go self so there is always the a bit of dynamic marketplace here and we are used to it.", "Douglas Peterson", "And these acquisitions are actually if you think about it the concern out there in the street is that these fracs, and small folks lot of business we lose this small customers. Well, the assets don't go away. They end up being purchased by someone else. So while we may lose the customer in one area that business tend to flow somewhere else because the walls don't necessarily get shake down \u2013 they may be dormant but they are not actually shut down.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and then one just last one on repurchases, you repurchased for the first time since [Cross Talking] okay sorry about that.", "Operator", "We\u2019ve a question from William Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "William Warmington", "Good morning everyone. So one follow up for you on plats, your renewals on plats are they spread out fairly evenly over the year or do they tend to be concentrated like some of your competitors sort of the Q4 and Q1 space? Yes, in generally speaking we have a couple of bulges in the fourth quarter and first quarter but a lot of them are spread out through the year but we do have a fourth and first quarter budge.", "Douglas Peterson", "And many with multi-year. Second and larger ones. ", "William Warmington", "Got it. And I can\u2019t resist given you balance sheet capacity you have got another M&A question. But you were talked about fixed income market potentially and I just wanted to ask about international specifically given your comments around the strong non-U.S. AUM growth.", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, so when we look at the M&A generally and also you mentioned fixed income industry our interest in the S&P industries for growth is international you have seen that almost every quarter we highlight some sort of a new exchange relationship. This quarter we highlighted our relationship with New Zealand. Those are very attractive deals for us. They are small but we really enjoyed the position with those relationship. So international expansions whether it\u2019s through exchange relationships M&A, organic growth it\u2019s something that is very important to us and fixed income investment in the industry business both organic and non-organic again those are top priorities for us.", "William Warmington", "Thank you and congratulations on a solid quarter.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from [Indiscernible] you may ask your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi its Jamie, thanks for taking my question. I will start up with couple of percent, if you are wondering I will just ask my two up front. I know you are there when I am here so, yes, I will just ask my two up front both about rating. So is there any seasonality Jack to call out in the public sector I know public sector has stayed local as June fiscal year and federal has September so is there any state in local seasonality am I saying questions about T-lack the total loss absorption capacity. Now can we just share couple of one liners about your expectations about T-lack. Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "Okay. Yes, I will take this is Doug. On the seasonality there really is not any seasonality in the fundraising in the public finance sector. What has been a bigger impact on the public financing sector has been as you know there are couple of bankruptcies there are some issues going on with pension funds. Those are much more important issues. What's really been interesting and what\u2019s been driving a lot of the public finance issuance in the last six months has been the rates environment. There was a lot of refinancing and refunding which came up. A lot of public finance issuance have a very attractive call provision in them and given where rates are there is a lot of public finance entities that have been taking advantage of that call and refunding at lower rate. So the lower rate has been probably the biggest driver not anything seasonal. On T-lack we expect even though finances services issuance was flat in the U.S. and down in Europe in the first quarter on more of a structural basis because of precisely the point that you just raised T-lack is going to be \u2013 going to require the largest banks although more than $50 billion of assets to do some sort of a capital raise of senior debt so we are expecting that there will be over time more financial services issuance to meet the requirements of T-lack and living wells and some of the other areas that are now being discussed in the regulatory environment.", "So let me just conclude the call and first of all thank everyone for your questions and for being on the call. We are very pleased that the first quarter had a strong beginning. It was a good start to the year. All of our business unit achieved revenue and adjusted profit growth. The margin improvement of 380 basis points or something that we want to keep working towards overtime to sustain. We achieved the adjusted diluted EPS of $1.09 and we are pleased that we have a lot of very important themes across the company which are driving our growth and performance that are well understood across the entire company. We have been communicating them so people understand them about dealing with our customers in a way that we have got very good relationships accelerating our international growth, sustaining our margin expansion, maintaining our discipline and capital allocation and very importantly also fostering our robust risk and compliance culture and managing our mitigating throughout the entire company. So we are pleased that we had a good beginning to the first quarter of the year and we look forward to working with all of you and speaking with you and shareholders throughout the year and thank you very much.", "Operator", "That does conclude this morning's call.

Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning and thanks for joining the call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we issued a news release announcing our acquisition of SNL Financial and a separate release regarding second quarter results. If you need a copy of the releases and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we'll provide adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

If you'd like a hardcopy, let us know.", "We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call; however, this call is intended for investors. And we'd ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at 212-512-3151.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Chip. Good Morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. We have two topics to cover with you on this call, the SNL Financial transaction announced this morning and our second quarter earnings. We're creating a compelling combination with the addition of SNL. So let's start with the transaction.", "Before I go into more detail, let me first give you some history. Shortly after I became CEO, we conducted a rigorous analysis of the markets we serve to define investment priorities and an acquisition wish list. For potential acquisitions, we analyzed quantitative factors such as financial performance and market size, as well as qualitative factors such as strategic fit, strength of management team, and cultural alignment.", "Our assessment identified SNL as a leading potential partner for MHFI and we began to explore the possibility of purchasing the company. Once we started interacting with (sic) SNL, we were quickly impressed with the people at SNL, in particular its talented and dynamic senior leadership team, led by Mike Chinn.", "We became even more convinced that a combination of the two companies offered a very attractive opportunity to create long-term shareholder value and with S&P Cap IQ and Platts, we are in a unique position to add SNL to our portfolio in a very complementary way.", "As many of you know, SNL is a leading provider of sector-specific market data, news and analytics for the financial institutions, real estate, insurance, media, energy, and metals and mining sectors. The company has increased organic revenue in the low-to-mid teens each year over the past decade. Its subscription business model, coupled with its strong renewal rates, is a great fit for McGraw Hill. We see exceptional opportunity to this combined company to further penetrate core customer segments, expand into new geographies and strengthen common core capabilities in data, technology and market approach.", "This is a compelling acquisition for five key reasons. There's unique fit with clear synergies with S&P Capital IQ and Platts. There is a common industry footprint especially in areas like banking and insurance where we can deepen our expertise. There's a proven growth engine, having delivered organic revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens. There are clear revenue and cost synergies, and there are sound transaction fundamentals. And Jack and I will cover all five in more depth today.", "SNL has a well-diversified customer base including investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, asset managers, corporations and government entities. Through this acquisition, we add two newer information businesses in adjacent sectors, real estate and media.", "SNL's products are commonly cited as best-in-class and must have by its customers due to the combination of differentiated content, proprietary analysis and deep sector coverage. Their products are embedded in the workflow of their user base with tools that have been customized to users' needs over time. For example, over the past 28 years, SNL has built strong relationships with over 75,000 users and its 5,000 customers. You'll note in the pie chart on the top right of this slide, that 91% of SNL's revenue is in the Americas. We believe that expanding SNL's global reach is one of the most attractive immediate opportunities.", "SNL has sector-specific expertise in five different industries; financial institutions, energy, metals and mining, real estate, and media and communications. Currently, financial institutions and energy are the two largest sectors. SNL's well-diversified customer base gives MHFI a stronger presence in banking and insurance. The company has expanded usage outside of its traditional investment banking customer base in recent years. Users leverage SNL for traditional M&A analysis. For example, the company has a widely used bank merger model, but their capabilities run far deeper. Additional popular use cases for the FIG product include branch mapping and competitive benchmarking.", "In the energy space, SNL monitors over 9,000 power plants, 100 gas utilities, 120 interstate pipelines, and 2,500 renewable energy plants. SNL tracks ownership and production data in over 80,000 mines across 60 countries in the metals and mining group. And in real estate, SNL has data on 140,000 commercial and residential properties globally. With each new market that SNL has entered, they deployed the same model of combining differentiated analytics with unique content and deep sector coverage.", "This timeline depicts SNL investments over the last decade. From its roots in providing sector-specific information and data on financial institutions, it was expanded into new sectors. In 2004, SNL entered the energy information market through an acquisition and has built an incredible franchise in power, coal and natural gas. Between 2012 and 2014, they launched their metals and mining platform with two acquisitions, and are beginning to get traction on those investments. They added especially valuable mine-level production data to its metals and mining practice with the acquisition of IntierraRMG in 2014.", "SNL started developing its European financials product in 2009. The product was launched in 2011 and is showing strong growth rate. This, in addition to similar FIG products for Asia and Latin America, represent an attractive opportunity for future value creation given the large and growing market. SNL added depth and diversification to its financial institutions platform when it acquired the insurance specialty company Highline Data in 2011.", "The company has a number of investments underway, and it's best to think about their businesses falling into two buckets; established businesses and developing businesses. On the left of this slide are a set of businesses with low-to-mid teens organic growth rates and margins in the 30%s. On the right are developing businesses, which are in investment phases and expected to turn a profit by 2017.", "This results in an aggregate margin in the 20%s.We believe SNL has the ability to continue to grow revenue and expand margins on its own, but together we think that the opportunity for growth are more substantial. The combination of SNL and McGraw Hill Financial will slightly modify our revenue mix. Adding SNL to our portfolio will increase the analytic, data and research revenue of McGraw Hill Financial from 33% to 36% and increase our recurring revenue from 60% to 62%.", "It wasn't that long ago that SNL's customer base was concentrated in the investment bank sector. They've systematically built products and verticals to provide attractive and compelling data solutions. In the pie chart in the upper left hand side of this slide, you can see SNL's customer diversification. SNL now serves all leading bulge bracket, regional, boutique investment banks in the United States, over 600 investment managers around the world, all of the largest 75 U.S. commercial banks, all 25 of the largest P&C and life insurance companies in the United States, and an array of the largest and most prestigious consulting companies, media companies, power utilities and mining companies.", "One of the most impressive qualities of SNL is its laser focus on data quality. SNL has a stellar reputation for sector-specific data accuracy and fast turnaround. And they have leveraged this successful operational model, as they've expanded into each new industry vertical.", "Now before I hand it to Jack, let me tell you again how impressed we've been with SNL overall with Mike Chinn and the leadership team specifically. The team has built an impressive company with a lot to be proud of, and we look forward to working together to build an even brighter future for McGraw Hill Financial.", "And now, let me turn it over to Jack who'll provide more details on the transaction.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Doug mentioned, SNL is a proven growth engine that will be additive to McGraw Hill Financial's future performance. The company has delivered mid-teens revenue growth for over a decade, driven by organic growth in the low-to-mid teens, complemented by selective acquisitions.", "The revenue model is highly stable, as it is a subscription-based business with high renewal rates and clear future revenue visibility, much like our S&P Cap IQ and Platts businesses. Furthermore, the upfront receipt of cash before the subscription period begins results in minimal working capital requirements. In 2015, we expect revenues of around $255 million and margins over 20%, which includes five points to six points of investment in the developing businesses that Doug just reviewed.", "Given the unique fit of SNL into McGraw Hill Financial, we have identified significant synergies, both cost and revenue based. We have built $70 million of EBITDA benefit in the financial plan that should be realized over the next four years by 2019. I will provide more detail on these synergies in just a moment.", "There's also a tax benefit associated with the basis step-up that has an NPV of approximately $550 million, which has an economic impact on the valuation. Relative to the earnings per share, for the first full year of operation in 2016, we anticipate accretion on a cash basis excluding transaction-specific amortization. On a GAAP basis, we expect the transaction to be accretive in 2018.", "As I just mentioned, SNL was a proven growth engine, delivering mid-teens growth over the last few years. Their established businesses are growing approximately 10% with margins over 30%. Their developing businesses, global expansion of their leading financial institutions product line, the build-out of the metals and mining product line, and selective software for U.S. banks and insurance companies are all expected to be profitable in 2017. As these developing businesses become profitable, overall margins in the business should strongly improve. This attractive margin profile will be further strengthened by synergies.", "The combination of SNL and McGraw Hill Financial provides significant revenue and cost synergies for SNL, and both our S&P Capital IQ and Platts businesses. With S&P Capital IQ, we see opportunities to deepen penetration in commercial banking, insurance and corporates. This includes a terrific opportunity to accelerate international growth for SNL's leading financial institutions products, leveraging the commercial reach of McGraw Hill Financial. In addition, we see incremental opportunity by developing new products that leverage capabilities in core sectors including risk management products for banking and insurance.", "With Platts, the opportunity exists to build out the combined energy and commodity platforms. The SNL products of energy focus largely on utilities and natural gas. In metals and mining, match up well with Platts' capabilities in these areas. In energy, there is an opportunity to expand internationally, leveraging the recent Platts acquisition of Eclipse. Furthermore, there are clear opportunities to introduce new products, especially in oil, leveraging the deep expertise of Platts.", "There are also greater opportunities to build out joint capability vertically in these commodity sectors by providing end-to-end information offerings covering price assessments, fundamental research and supply/demand analytics. Finally, SNL adds scale and leverage to our data and technology operations, which will enable us to drive efficiencies and add new opportunities to enrich existing product offerings.", "Let me provide a bit more color on the data-related opportunity. SNL adds considerable capabilities in data collection, analysis and research with addition of 2,000 employees in key offshore locations. The combined capabilities of both companies will have approximately 7,200 employees primarily in locations that can attract well-trained analytical associates at a reasonable cost. This is a terrific asset to power future growth.", "The total synergies built into the $70 million of EBITDA by 2019 are roughly half cost related and the balance revenue related. The revenue synergies assumed over the medium term are fairly straightforward, as McGraw Hill Financial will work with SNL to extend their global reach. Quite simply, no other billion-dollar-plus acquisition that we have reviewed since the formation of McGraw Hill Financial has offered such a clear synergy opportunity, both over the medium term and longer term in new product development and customer relevance.", "The clear synergy is a significant consideration into the overall valuation of the business that supported the purchase price. There are several other important items to consider as part of the valuation. As Doug and I have both discussed, the current profitability of the business is impacted by investments in the developing businesses, which are growing rapidly but are not yet profitable. We evaluated these investments in great detail and are comfortable with the ramp rates of profitability by 2017. The valuation needed to provide a return on these investments, which included multiple acquisitions over the last four years to five years. There is also considerable value from the tax basis step-up, which on a net present value basis is worth approximately $550 million.", "Lastly, with the upfront cash receipts exceeding revenue, the cash basis on which evaluation is based is roughly a year ahead of GAAP EBITDA. If you take into consideration the economic impact of a tax step-up, the value of this transaction is approximately $1.7 billion. As we move past the investment cycle that is nearing an end and consider that cash flow was roughly a year ahead of EBITDA, we view the price of this transaction as having a mid-teens multiple on 2017 cash flow before the impact of synergies. Longer term, the synergies across SNL, S&P Cap IQ and Platts provide a terrific opportunity for significant shareholder value creation.", "Financing of the transaction should be relatively straightforward given our strong balance sheet and the success of our recent bond offering, which reintroduced McGraw Hill Financial to the fixed income investor. This acquisition will be funded by a combination of approximately $525 million of cash on the balance sheet and $1.7 billion of new debt. A committed bridge financing of $1 billion combined with our existing credit facility of $1.2 billion will provide additional flexibility through closing. Post deal, we anticipate 1.6 times pro forma leverage, which provides ongoing flexibility in returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, and pursuing future growth opportunities while maintaining an investment-grade rating.", "Our approach to integration will be to have SNL's CEO, Mike Chinn, report directly to Doug. Mike and his executive team are based in Charlottesville, Virginia, and we are committed to that location over the long term. Initially for financial reporting purposes, we will report SNL as part of S&P Cap IQ, but that may evolve over time. We expect immediate areas of focus to include pragmatic integration of corporate, data and technology capability, as well as sales force training on this enhanced product line.", "Let me summarize by saying that SNL has a unique fit to McGraw Hill Financial, adding sector-specific depth and overall scale. It is a proven growth engine with compelling revenue and cost synergy opportunities across both S&P Cap IQ and Platts. We believe that McGraw Hill Financial is the right owner for SNL.", "Now, let me hand the call back over to Doug to discuss our second quarter results.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Jack. And as I've said in the past, we're aligned around four very important themes to drive growth and performance, and create value, strengthening our customer and stakeholder engagement, accelerating our international growth, sustaining our margin expansion and maintaining discipline in capital allocation, and fostering a robust risk and compliance culture to manage and mitigate risk throughout the company. As you just heard, the acquisition of SNL today fits very well with these themes.", "Now let's turn to the second quarter and I'm pleased to report solid results. The company delivered increased revenue despite unfavorable foreign exchange rates and decreased issuance outside of the United States, continued margin expansion with a 450 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin, a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS to $1.21, strong year-to-date free cash flow of $621 million excluding the payments of legal settlements, issuance of $700 million of new 10-year notes as we re-entered the capital markets for the first time in eight years, increased capital return with repurchase of 2.6 million shares year-to-date, new additions to the portfolio with purchases of NADA Used Car Guide in J.D. Power and Petromedia in Platts, and continued productivity efforts across the company, which Jack will review later in the call.", "Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter results. Revenue increased 3%, but excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenue increased 6%. Adjusted operating profit increased 16%. While geopolitical concerns negatively impacted issuance in our ratings business, adjusted operating profit increased across the entire portfolio. Progress on productivity initiatives resulted in a year-over-year decline in adjusted expenses. These initiatives have been focused on de-layering the organization, driving process efficiencies and improving productivity.", "Of note, on Friday, we will close the door on our former Midtown headquarters as the last wave of employees relocates to our downtown Manhattan operating center at 55 Water Street. Productivity actions led to an adjusted operating margin increase of 450 basis points and adjusted diluted EPS increase of 17%. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services reported its second highest revenue ever, but due to unfavorable changes in FX and weak issuance outside the United States, did not exceed the second quarter of last year. Every other business segment delivered year-on-year revenue growth.", "Now, let me turn to the individual businesses and I'll start with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. In the quarter, revenue decreased 1%. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, revenue increased 3%. Adjusted operating profit grew 7% and the adjusted operating margin increased 370 basis points to 50%. While revenue was negatively impacted by FX, it has less of an impact on operating profit. S&P Ratings Services continues to make progress improving margin. Reduced head count from recent restructurings and lower incentive costs were the primary contributors to this quarter's margin improvement. In addition, ratings continues to implement a process re-engineering program called The Way We Work (25:17). Legal expenses were significantly lower. However, this was offset by costs associated with Dodd-Frank implementation, as we continue to invest in people and technology.", "Transaction revenue increased from 49% to 50% of total revenue. Non-transaction revenue decreased due to the effects of a strong dollar. Excluding the impact of FX, non-transaction revenue increased 3% due primarily to annual fee growth. Transaction revenue grew 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is a result of the record U.S. public finance issuance and strong U.S. investment-grade issuance paced by a number of large M&A transactions.", "When we look at second quarter issuance in the U.S., it was driven by a 20% increase in public finance, as call options on strong 2005 issuance are being refinanced and a 30% increase in investment-grade issuance. U.S. structure finance issuance in total was unchanged with a 53% increase in CMBS and an 18% decrease in structured credit, which is predominantly CLOs.", "In Europe, issuance decreased in almost every category. RMBS was the notable exception. Concerns about Greek debt, slowing growth in China and dramatic volatility in German sovereign debt along with a very, very low cost bank liquidity all combined to dampen bond market activity outside the United States during the quarter. In Europe, investment-grade debt issuance decreased actually 33% and high-yield debt declined 54%. Structured issuance decreased 7% with RMBS being the primary area of strength. Not depicted on this chart is issuance from other parts of the world, which collectively, excluding sovereigns, declined over 50%.", "Now let me turn to S&P Capital IQ. Revenue grew 6% with consistent growth globally, adjusted segment operating profit grew 37%, and adjusted operating margin increased 520 basis points to 22.9%. Capitalizing on past investments, the margin improvement is the result of product enhancements to deliver revenue growth coupled with tight cost control. In fact, head count increased less than 1% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of FX, revenue increased 7% and expenses only 3%.", "Let me add a bit more color on growth in the three business lines of S&P Capital IQ. S&P Capital IQ Desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7% primarily as a result of low-teens increase in desktop revenue driven by a similar increase in users. S&P Credit Solutions revenue increased 6% due primarily to growth in RatingsXpressand RatingsDirect. In the smallest category, S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence revenue decreased 4% overall. Strong growth in Global Market Intelligence and Leveraged Commentary & Data, however, was offset by declines in Equity Research services.", "Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, this business delivered an 11% increase in revenue due to ETF, mutual funds, data license and derivatives revenue, which all increased. Operating profit increased 16% and the operating profit margin increased 250 basis points to 64.6%. During the quarter, we introduced 64 new indices, many in the fixed income space and the net of new ETFs based upon our indices were launched. ETF's asset under management associated with our indices increased 10% to $792 billion versus the end of the second quarter in 2014.", "Please note that while our year-over-year growth was meaningful, this AUM decreased from the record $832 billion at the end of 2014, and the ETF flows moved to products offering European and non-U.S. exposure. One of our fastest growing categories has been the products based on our smart data indices. AUM in these products increased 55% year-over-year to $133.6 billion.", "This next slide depicts two charts that should help you understand year-to-year ETF industry flows. In the chart on the left, you see that the AUM linked to ETFs, based on our indices, has declined recently. While the year-over-year comparisons are still positive, AUM has declined since the end of 2014. The chart on the right shows that inflows into passively managed ETFs continue to be robust. In fact, while down sequentially, the industry experienced record first half flows of $146 billion. Unfortunately, compared to recent quarters, the percentage of flows directed to products based on our indices has declined. We view this as temporary, as investors move into global products.", "During the quarter, we launched the flagship of our fixed income indices, the S&P 500 Bond Index. This is the first index that tracks the debt of the S&P 500 companies and the first to be priced in real-time throughout the day. We divide the market value of the bonds and with the maturity requirement of greater than one month, we anticipate that the S&P 500 Bond Index will be liquid enough to also serve as the basis for potential ETF and structured products.", "The S&P 500 Bond Index currently tracks the debt of 430 S&P 500 companies, reflecting over $3 trillion in debt outstanding. At the launch, we published more than 20 years of daily historical data on the S&P 500 Bond Index. We'll round out this offering with multiple S&P 500 Index variations based on duration, rating and sector. Examples include the S&P 500 AA Investment Grade Corporate Bond, the S&P 500 Five-Year to Seven-Year Investment-Grade Corporate Bond Index, and the S&P 500 Utilities Corporate Bond Index.", "And finally, as you know, we have formed a number of unique and dynamic alliances with exchanges in various markets since 1998. This quarter, we signed an agreement with the BM&FBOVESPA, designed to create and launch new co-branded Brazilian equity indices. In addition, we have signed an agreement with the BMV, the Mexican Stock Exchange, incorporating all of BMV's indices, including their flagship index, IPC, the broadest indicator of the BMV's overall performance.", "In the Commodities & Commercial Markets segment, revenue grew 7%, with organic growth of 6% excluding the Eclipse acquisition. This was led by high-single-digit revenue growth at Platts. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 15%. Adding together the solid revenue growth and tight cost control, the adjusted operating margin increased 270 basis points to 37.8%. J.D. Power delivered low-single-digit revenue growth by double-digit revenue growth from the PIN information network \u2013 the Power Information Network, and modest growth in the U.S. auto sector. Revenues in Asia were negative, as growth in the China market moderated and Japan revenue declined.", "Platts continued to deliver strong results while building for the future. Platts demonstrated resiliency, delivering high-single-digit revenue growth despite continued low commodity prices. Platts' results, while quite strong, would have been even stronger except that several major banks have withdrawn from the commodity space and upselling new products have been difficult in this low oil price environment. Metals, Agriculture and Petrochemicals continued to deliver the highest revenue growth rates, and Global Trading Services increased primarily due to license revenue from The Steel Index derivative activity and record eWindow trading volumes.", "Petromedia is a small but interesting tuck-in acquisition for Platts. Through a product named Bunkerworld, Petromedia provides pricing, news and analytics for the global marine fuel market. Bunker makes up 70% of the cost of chartering a ship and is therefore a critical price component for the industry. The other main product is Ocean Intelligence, which provides credit reports for the bunker industry and adds to Platts risk management offerings.", "The highlights of the quarter for J.D. Power was the acquisition of the NADA Used Car Guide. This is the premier source of used car value benchmarks. This acquisition fits well with J.D. Power's PIN business, as both generate essential pricing benchmarks and analytics. This subscription-based business with more than 30,000 business customers expands J.D. Power's offerings in the U.S. automotive OEM, retailer, financial services and insurance markets.", "This final slide shows examples of how different sectors utilize this reliable used car benchmark data in their businesses.", "With that I want to thank you for joining the call this morning and now I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Doug. I know this has been a longer call this morning than our norm, so I just want to briefly add some color on several items related to the second quarter financial performance, the balance sheet and the impact of the SNL acquisition on our 2015 guidance and then we'll open it up to your questions.", "First, I will recap key financial results and review certain adjustments to earnings that were recorded in the quarter. Let's start with the second quarter income statement.", "Overall, these were very good results especially the continuing progress in margin improvement. Revenue grew 3% despite the continuous headwinds from foreign exchange which reduced our growth rate by about three points. Adjusted consolidated operating profit grew 16% with all four business units contributing to this growth.", "Operating margins were over 41%, up 450 basis points from a year ago. This is the highest quarterly margin achieved since the formation of McGraw Hill Financial. Revenue growth combined with progress on our productivity initiatives contributed to this significant step-up. While foreign exchange had a negative impact on revenue we had had almost no impact on adjusted operating profit for the company as a whole due to the offsetting impact to expenses.", "Adjusted unallocated expenses decreased 22% as the prior period had cost associated with the sales of certain assets. The tax rate on an adjusted basis was 32.3%; for the balance of the year we continue to guide below a 33% rate.", "Adjusted net income increased 17%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.21 versus the toughest comparison from 2014. The average diluted shares outstanding decreased by almost 1.5 million shares versus a year ago, as share repurchase activity offset the diluted impact of shares granted for equity related compensation.", "Now, let me turn to adjustments to earnings, to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business.", "In total, pre-tax adjustments to earnings from continued operations resulted in a $30 million gain during the quarter. This consisted of $41 million in net settlement related insurance recoveries, a gain of $11 million related to the sale of a legacy construction business asset and $22 million of restructuring charges as the company continues to de-layer and streamline operations.", "Now, I'll turn to cash flow and the return of capital. Our year-to-date free cash flow was a negative $988 million. However, once the payments associated with legal settlements are excluded, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, year-to-date free cash flow was a positive $621 million. That puts us well on our way to full year 2015 guidance of greater than $1.1 billion.", "During the quarter, the company stepped up its share repurchase program and bought 1.6 million shares bringing the year-to-date total to 2.6 million shares. The share repurchase program remains an important component of our overall capital allocation, and we anticipate continuing to selectively repurchase shares under our remaining share repurchase authorization of 42.9 million shares.", "Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. As of the end of the second quarter, we had $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 70% was held outside the United States. Our cash position was augmented with the issuance of $700 million of 10-year notes in May. This was the first bond offering by the company since 2007 and we were delighted with the strong interest from investors in the attractive 4% coupon. We used some of the proceeds from these notes to pay down the short-term debt that we incurred during the first quarter. And during the quarter we completed the refinancing of our $1.2 billion credit facility.", "At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.5 billion term debt. As a result of the SNL acquisition, as we discussed earlier, we currently anticipate issuing $1.7 billion of long-term debt to fund the transaction and we anticipate completing the financing ahead of projected closing. Once completed, this would bring our total debt to approximately $3.2 billion or 1.6 times EBITDA. The unique fit of SNL combined with the smaller acquisitions of NADA Used Car Guide by J.D. Power and Petromedia by Platts, all strengthened the McGraw Hill Financial portfolio and will contribute to sustained growth. In the context of 2015 guidance, and assuming that the SNL transaction closes towards the end of the third quarter, we anticipate that the deal to collectively add approximately $80 million to $90 million of revenue over the balance of this year in the second half and SNL specifically have a dilutive impact to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.05 to $0.07.", "However, based on the strength of the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we will leave adjusted EPS guidance unchanged at $4.35 to $4.45. At this point, we would expect performance toward the higher end of this range.", "In closing, we continue to focus on creating growth and driving performance, building out the portfolio, improving margins and returning cash to shareholders. And today is truly a special day, as we look forward to welcoming over 3,000 associates of SNL Financial to McGraw Hill Financial.", "With that, we will now open the call to your questions.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. Please press star, one to indicate that you wish to enter the queue and ask a question. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press star two. I would kindly ask you to limit yourself to two questions, that's two questions, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. If you've been listening through a speakerphone but would like to now ask a question, we ask that you lift your handset prior to pressing star one and remain on the handset until your question has been answered. This will ensure better sound quality. Operator, we'll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The first question comes from Alex Kramm, UBS. Your line is open.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah, hey, good morning, everyone. Hopefully you can hear me okay. I'm remote. But anyways, Doug, I guess, for you, I mean, you often described McGraw Hill Financial as a collection of benchmark businesses. So obviously, those are hard to purchase or hard to expand. So maybe can you just summarize to us how you think SNL can be one of those benchmark businesses or not. And then maybe specifically, you said part of this business will be part of Platts, or could be part of Platts over time. When I look at the customer base, it's really just financial companies and not really the core user base of Platts. So can you maybe talk about this a little bit because a benchmark company, I would assume some corporate users as well?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, thank you for the question. First of all, let me just mention that as we've been looking at our overall strategy, we focus on a combination of benchmark, of data, analytics and research. And all of these are different sorts of products which get embedded into the workflow of the users that we work with.", "So first of all, SNL really is a benchmarking business at heart. If you look at how they produce the information, the proprietary data, and the focus and attention to detail that they provide, it's very similar to what you would look at for a benchmarking business. They're not a traditional price or index or credit benchmark, but they serve as financial performance and operating performance benchmarks for companies and assets in our space.", "We do look at them in addition to \u2013 as your second part of your question about how they would enhance our business related to Platts. They've been building verticals in the mining space, in the energy market analysis. As an example, they've got industry forecast curves and proprietary daily spot market prices in the energy market. They have operational statistics on over 5,000 electrical utilities. They've got power plant unit level data. On the mining world, they've got profiles of statistics on all mining projects globally. They've got customized maps.", "They've got location data, company primary, commodity information, ownership information, et cetera. All of that is very similar to what Bentek does, and very complementary to Bentek and Eclipse in the natural gas space. And so we see a lot of excellent fits in ways that we'll be able to leverage their database and their relationship. So I think that we want to make sure that you get more and more data about who they are and who their customers are, but you'll see over time as you get a chance to learn about them, that they've diversified incredibly well beyond their traditional investment banking portfolio.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then really just secondly for Jack. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about the \u2013 I guess the accretion as we think about 2016, and to some degree also from a mechanical and technical perspective. So if you're saying it's accretive on a cash basis, are you actually going to adjust your earnings next year to exclude amortization? Or will we still find this dilutive on a reported basis? And if so, how much dilution do you think you could expect next year from an EPS perspective? Thanks.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "At this point in time I don't anticipate that we would exclude the amortization specifically relative to the transaction. However, we will point you towards to let you know what it is such that you can judge the cash accretion that we're forecasting for next year. So we will connect the dots there. I think we have some work to do to close this deal. We have to finalize some purchase accounting, so I would say on a GAAP basis next year the dilution for 2016, please this is the first pass (45:46) view of it, it's somewhere between $0.15 to $0.20. And we'll tighten up that range as we integrate this into our 2016 financial planning and future guidance.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Very helpful. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Bill Bird, FBR Capital Markets, you're line is open.", "Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yeah. Good morning. The synergy numbers are quite large relative to EBITDA. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what's included in the synergies. Also, what's not included? And then how do you expect synergies to phase in between now and 2018? Thank you.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me start, Bill. This is Doug. Well first of all, one of the things we've been impressed with at SNL as we've gotten to know them is their ability to run a very tight operational shop and how they've got ways that we can work together, as Jack showed on that map, in their operating centers around the globe. And then second, as you saw from the chart, they've got 91% of their sales today are in the United States. And we have a sales force and penetration globally that we think that we can get a lot of synergies from there. But let me hand it over to Jack for some more detail.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Two points, and maybe let me address maybe cost synergies first and then come back on revenue, because the case is built roughly 50-50. First on cost, I would \u2013 we came at the analysis not just looking at the costs of SNL, we looked at the costs across SNL, S&P Capital IQ and Platts. I think when you look across that cost base, the cost synergies that we assumed here are actually quite modest, and there's a lot of overlapping capability as it relates to technology, in some cases data, et cetera. So I think you need to say from a cost point of view (47:43) take a more holistic view of it.", "Secondly in terms of revenue, there's both near term, what's called medium term and longer term revenue synergies. Some of the more medium term are taking the great products they've already developed, like their global FIG product, and we just have a much greater sales force coverage than what SNL has today. In collective, we just have more feet on the street to kind of expand that, to accelerate their global build out. And then longer term, we gave and we talked. There's a lot of new product development opportunity that's quite exciting both maybe in more traditional S&P Capital IQ space but also as Doug was just mentioning with Platts in terms of the mutual areas of capability that we built out there.", "Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then a question on the phasing in, how it may phase in between now and 2018.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I mean traditionally, as you'd expect, the cost synergies are a little bit more forward weighting between now and \u2013 we have pointed to $70 million by 2019. We may get a little bit more benefit on the revenue side a little earlier because of the opportunities to just kind of take their existing product line through our sales force. And in terms of the specifics for 2016, we'll give you more guidance on that when we do it in the context of our full outlook for next year, towards the end of this year or early next.", "Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Thank you.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks Bill.", "Operator", "Andre Benjamin, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning. First question. I know you're just getting your hands around this large deal, but I was thinking, what does this mean for incremental M&A, which you mentioned you may continue to do. How we should think about areas of focus? Should we expect you to do some other things like continue to build the index business more organically like you've been doing. Then if you were to do a deal, how high a leverage you would be temporarily willing to go for that deal.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Andre, good morning. Thank you for the question. We continue to believe we have flexibility to pursue what we've always described before as our asset allocation between investing in organic growth, smaller tuck-in acquisitions, continuing to pay our dividend and also repurchase shares. We, as I mentioned earlier, we're focused on benchmark businesses, in particular, how we can also enhance those with high quality data and research businesses. So we hope that we can continue to do small transactions like the other ones that we announced this quarter with Petromedia and NADA Used Car Guide. And so it's our goal to continue to add to the portfolio high quality properties over time, but in the sense, we also want to keep a level of leverage so we're also able to always pay our dividend and repurchase shares.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then on the core business, I know you mentioned that you were having some challenge in the Platts business from some banks pulling back. Any color on exactly how much of a headwind that was, just color, I apologize if I missed it. And more importantly, do you have any visibility into how many more may follow that trend going forward?", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Yeah, I wouldn't refer to it as a challenge. I mean Platts had a great quarter, so I would not put it in that context at all. We probably lost a point or two of growth off of what we otherwise would have had because of some of the banks pulling out of commodity space, and a couple of small factors going out of business. But great quarter, and with oil prices the way they've gone so directly south, it's kind of amazing how little Platts has been impacted.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Joseph Foresi, Janney Montgomery Scott, your line is open.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the pricing structure of the SNL acquisition and how you feel pricing power there relates to what you're seeing in Capital IQ?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You know I think we've been very impressed with the must-have capability of what SNL offers its customer set and the very sector specific data and analytics that they provide. I think they, over time, they have realized reasonable pricing improvements over time and I suspect that will continue. But I think that \u2013 I wouldn't point to anything unusual about pricing. I think it's more what we work on across both our S&P Cap IQ business and Platts. So I think it's very similar.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Okay. And then if I could just get some comments on Europe and the issuance market there and your thought sort of as we head towards the back half of the year. Thanks.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So Europe has continued to be incredibly weak. There's a combination of factors that I mentioned earlier, the volatility that we saw earlier in the year with the German yields. We also saw some of the negative interest rate issuance, et cetera. We haven't seen too much of a rebound in Europe in this July, although there have been a few reserve Yankee bonds, which have gone to the market in a few financial institutions.", "But overall Europe investment grade was down 33% and the investment-grade corporates were down 33% in the second quarter. Financial institutions were down 40%. Total Europe was down over 40% and the rest of the world was down 54%. So we saw very strong issuance in the U.S. and investment grade was up almost 30%, although non-investment grade in the U.S. was down 8.9%. So as I've already said every quarter when we have these calls and when I meet with investors is that we don't know what each quarter is going to bring and we have a longer term forecast that, I think, was a combination of refinancing with global growth, with a belief that we have \u2013 that Europe will continue to move from a banking market to a capital market overall. In a long run, we will see growth in issuance but we do see quarter-by-quarter a lot of volatility.", "Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Doug Arthur, Huber Research, your line is open.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners", "Yeah, thanks. Jack, I think you mentioned or Doug that the organic growth trend at SNL has been low-to-mid teens. Can you break that down between sort of how much of that growth is a function of the new verticals they've gotten into? Or another way of asking the question is what's the organic growth of the very established products? Are they slowing or are they also growing at a mid-teens level? Thanks.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Chart in the deck.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There's a chart in the deck that, I think, kind of lays it out over the last few years, I think back to 2012. So on a compounded basis, including the forecast for 2015, the established businesses have been growing around 10%. And then the developing businesses have been growing, I think it's 70%...", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "70%, yeah.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "CAGR over the last few years for an all-in CAGR of around 16%. Now on the established side, it's really a combination of both organic investment combined with selective acquisitions. So you should view the developing business as a combination of both internal investments that they've made combined with some of these acquisitions. And if you look at the timeline, you can see they've been pretty active the last few years adding to the mix.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's on slide 16.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners", "Okay. So just to clarify, the organic growth has included the impact of the small tuck-ins.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. Let's break it apart. I think if you kind of go within the established businesses \u2013 I mean the developing businesses, some of that's been internal investments, some of that's been acquisitions. So depending on the year that's why we kind of classified over a longer term timeframe there a growth of either low-teens to mid-teens depending on the year.", "Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners", "Okay. Okay. Thank you. I'll go back and take a look at it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Denny Galindo, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, there. Good morning. I had a quick one just on the quarter on Capital IQ margins were very strong \u2013 it looks like the best since 2012 or so. And I wanted to get a feeling for whether there was any kind of one-time-ish benefit from here, whether it was kind of mix-driven. I know that some of your lower profit pieces of that segment have been declining whereas some of the other ones are growing. Or any other kind of one-time issues that might have driven that margin expansion and can we expect it to continue?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. First of all, in terms of we have been doing some selective restructuring in that business and also the team there has done a nice job of sort of re-sequencing on, I think, some of the investments that were underway in the business. And I think that's starting to have some real benefits. I would say though, the margin, close to \u2013 there is a little bit of an impact in their margins in Cap IQ from forex. Just about all of their revenue is dollar denominated based and so from an expense point of view, we are benefiting from forex particularly in the pound and the euro. So a little less than half is forex, but the rest is just good performance in terms of expense management.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then lastly, this SNL is really more of a sector-specific data platform. And actually some of the more general platforms have also been going to providing more sector-specific information. Is this kind of a trend in the industry that everyone's going to have their own sector-specific platform instead of the more general one-size-fits-all platforms or do you think it's just additive or maybe you could just talk about that trend?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, let me \u2013 from the point of view of the trend, I think that what \u2013 we find what our users and customers are looking for is depth, and depth of knowledge, depth of data, time series, being able to go back for a long time to be able to understand the kind of data need. As an example, not related to SNL, but when we launched the S&P 500 Bond Index, we put in 20 years of back data on this kind of transaction. So what I would look at is that the type of data and analytics that are required more and more in the market is sophistication. And to have that kind of sophistication, we need to have depth and data and industry-specific information that something like SNL has. So I think SNL has been a leader in this area as well as some of the other McGraw Hill Financial businesses, and you should expect to see this kind of activity from a lot of different companies.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Operator?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray, your line is now open.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Thanks. So, Doug, it looks like S&P's revenue growth maybe is lagging a little bit relative to some of the peers or relative to the overall industry. Do you have any bridge in terms of why that differential may exist?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So when I've looked at this in a couple of different ways, the main driver of differential in growth is in the United States and it's in the structured finance markets, specifically. If you look at the issuance during the second quarter, as I went through them, the largest growth in the United States was in the investment-grade corporates and in public finance, which we continue to perform very well in. And then the only sector where there was growth in the United States in structured finance was in CMBS. And as you know, we are temporarily not involved in conduit/fusion in CMBS and that's the main differentiating factor that we've seen when we look at our competitors.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Got it. Thank you. And then on the margin side, the progress at S&P has obviously been very impressive. Can you talk about how far along we are in the margin improvement story? Are most of the gains baked in at this point or is there more to come?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're going to continue to work as much as possible on that, although we continue to invest in people and technology. We think that it's important that we automate and update our systems such as our processing systems, I mentioned The Way We Work (61:35), Dodd-Frank. We're also ensuring that we have high-quality publication and publishing systems so that we think that we're very, very pleased with the performance and with the improvement in the margins. We will continue to attack those margins through every different lever we have. But on the other hand, we want to continue to invest to have the highest quality and very high-quality risk management when we look at the way we manage the company. So we're pleased, we think that there should continue to be more progress, but we don't want to overpromise, either.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, Peter, I want to add, just as a reminder, is this was a good revenue quarter, so there is the importance of revenue leverage in the margin. So I think while 50% margins are quite attractive, I'm not sure I'd straight-line that, particularly the third quarter, which traditionally is a little bit lower in revenues, but we're overall extraordinarily pleased with the solid progress we've made there.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Tim McHugh, William Blair, your line is now open.", "Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes. I guess, just another question on SNL, the differentiation, I guess. Can you help us just for those less familiar with the product, I guess, how is the data different than what people can get through other kind of data providers or is it more the research and kind of analysis layered on top of the data that's really, I guess, the differentiating point as SNL goes to market here?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, this is Jack. I'll take a start and then maybe Doug can add on. I mean I think what's different is if you kind of compare it with S&P Cap IQ, which has sort of broad coverage, SNL has really grown up very sector specific with deep, deep expertise in financial institutions and that's where they really have perfected their model and then what they have by building off that depth, they then have kind of taken that model, then expanded it to other significant industry types that then have provided them the growth. And they're still in the middle of this expansion and investment phase.", "That's why we're very excited to work with them now to leverage the great progress they've made in taking their financial institutions product globally and we want to work with them with the Platts and the investments they've made in energy and metals and mining, it's kind of collectively continued to build out that very sector-specific deep insight. And they provide some tools that, back to Doug's earlier point about getting all the way down to workflow, that actually will be simplified as far as some of \u2013 even simplifying some of the regulatory requirements \u2013 some of the regulatory requirements for some of the commercial banks. So they're very, very deep and very much linked into the workflow of their clients.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me just add as an example in the bank area where they started and the kind of discipline that they're now moving into their other vertical. So if you were to look at the United States banking market, they have detailed information about every branch of every bank in the United States. They can look at the proximity of the different branches and overlap analysis. They can have an analysis of bird eye views and satellite. They can map it. They can look at the markets and the market demographics of every branch. They can look at deposit concentration and deposit growth. They can then add into that deposit rates, auto rates, mortgage rates, asset quality, demographics, et cetera. And so that's the kind of information which is unparalleled, as they built up in that kind of a market and they've taken that expertise and that approach to managing and gathering data and then distributing that, which is a combination of proprietary data mapped with some third-party data so that they really provide something that is quite unique. And they've moved that into other markets and it's very complementary to both S&P Capital IQ and Platts, as we've said.", "Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And as we think about, I guess, the core part of SNL, the growth, 10% growth, I guess, over the last few years, do you have any sense that you can give us for how much of that is price versus customer growth, versus selling additional products to the established customer base?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think it would be premature to get into that a little detail on this call, but it's been a combination of both extending their reach and some fair realization on pricing.", "Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tim.", "Operator", "Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo, your line is open.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you and congratulations on the SNL acquisition. Their accuracy guarantee is famous. So one question I wanted to ask you was just to make sure that I had the bridge correctly in terms of how you're looking at the acquisition costs before and after the adjustments. So if we just start out unadjusted the $2.25 billion \u2013 $2.225 billion versus the EBITDA, it looks like about $51 million unadjusted, and then we can adjust, you can back out the $550 million on the tax and add the $70 million back to the EBITDA. That would get you to something closer to a 14 multiple. Is that the way you're thinking about it?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think you kind of look forward, I mean because their current margins are so impacted by the investments that they're making in the developing businesses combined with the fact that they've made a number of acquisitions in these areas to kind of build them out with \u2013 I would probably \u2013 I would look forward to 2017 whereas these investments work, which we have spent a lot of time looking at, that we're quite excited about. Once as they start to basically contribute to the profit pool before any real application of synergies, you start to be getting to a GAAP EBITDA in 2017 of around $100 million.", "And also, to remember this is based on, the valuation here is based on cash not GAAP EBITDA. And they tend to have like 98% of their customers pay ahead. So if you think about it from a rough cash EBITDA, you could add at least on a current run rate around $20 million to that number. So I think that's more the right range to think about, comparing it to what the valuation of the business is. And then we start to layer in the synergies as we start to move forward into 2017, 2018, beyond.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. And then a question on the overall business, it's such a high percentage of renewals. Is there a seasonality to the renewals? Are most of them taking place at the end of December, beginning of January? Or is it just kind of spread out throughout the year?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Most of them \u2013 a good number of their deals are multi-year in nature. So it's a little bit of a mix. There's a little bit of maybe the end of the year, but there's nothing overly pronounced in it.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We've been quite impressed with their overall success in their renewals. And really on a consistent year-on-year fashion, it's really quite remarkable particularly when you consider how they've expanded out from their core strength in financial institutions into new sectors over the last few years.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. Well, thank you very much.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Operator", "James Friedman, Susquehanna, your line is now open.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. Thank you. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. I was wondering with regard to the $140 million cost takeout plan for the McGraw Hill side, if you can update us just as to where you are there and then I guess I'll ask my SNL upfront. In terms of five points to six points of investment, could you articulate in a little bit more detail where that investment's going?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. In terms of \u2013 we're well on track to \u2013 this was our cost saving, I think that's pretty obvious by looking at our margins that the progress that we have made there. And as Doug mentioned, one part of that program was the exit of our old headquarters building, which has been completed over the last few weeks. So we're well on our way to delivering on that target and we may actually \u2013 given the very strong margin performance we've had so far, we may be a little ahead of that previous target that we had set to have full realization of the $140 million by the end of 2016. So I think we're a bit ahead, but we'll give a more complete update on that as we approach the back half of the year.", "And as it relates back to your investment on the five points to six points of investment, that has all to do with the investments they're making in the build-out of the developing businesses. So that's taking the FIG products global. It's building out metals and mining, which is really interesting to us and its synergy with Platts. And they also have some selective software business' capabilities that they offer U.S. commercial banks and insurance companies. So those businesses are growing very nicely at a compounded basis of around 70% over the last few years, and they'll start contributing to profitability in 2017.", "James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, thank you. Just one question for Jack and then one for Doug as well. So firstly, on the margins for SNL Financial, I just want to make sure I've got that clear. So you said steady state their margins should be 30%, I think you said there was five points to six points of investments going on. So I guess margins should be 25%, but I think you said this year it was only 20%, so I just wanted to know what that gap was, and if that 30% includes your synergies by 2018?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, look, I think the way to think about it is their established businesses right now are in the 30% range. They're investing in the developing businesses. So once the developing businesses start to contribute to profitability, frankly they're a drag right now. Overall company margins will start to approach that 30% sort of number over time. So that's the sort of \u2013 and then there's also just some general margin improvement in the established businesses. And that's just, the sequence of the build-out of these developing businesses should improve the overall margins of the business over the next two years. Then we would layer in specific synergies.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then just big picture, Doug, it seems like, obviously you guys are looking at 2017 cash EBITDA. There seems like some work left in terms of synergies and tax benefits and so forth, and you get your mid-teens multiple. WoodMac seem like it was sort of a cleaner (01:12:56), like you get to similar multiples in 2017, so what was the difference between walking out of that deal in valuation versus pursuing this one?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't have any comments on WoodMac (01:13:11). What I would say is that we're very, very please with SNL. It's a fantastic business, as I said earlier. Mike Chinn and the management team has built a very high-quality set of businesses and operating procedures. We think that they bring a high-quality operating platform. They've got product innovation and that they can benefit it tremendously from our global reach as well as the operating centers we already have. This is really about SNL today and we're very pleased that we're able to announce this transaction.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, all right. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Vincent Hung, Autonomous, your line is now open.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Hi. Good morning.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Just first question. Could you just talk about the existing management team and how they're going to be incentivized and how long they're going to be locked in for?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Locked in?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So we have contracts with Mike Chinn and the folks, that sort of thing.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Are you talking about the SNL people or the McGraw Hill Financial?", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Yeah. The SNL.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I think in our approach, we are \u2013 look Mike is now a direct report to Doug. One of the reasons why we're excited about this deal was the quality of that leadership team and we're looking forward to working with them and we're quite comfortable that we're going to have that opportunity over the coming years, so.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Okay. Last question. On slide 12, you break out revenues by customer type. Can you just give us a sense for revenue growth by those customer types?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "All we would say is that I think \u2013 you're asking in the context of SNL?", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Yeah.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. The only thing, I think, we would say today is that they've done a very nice job of broadening it out from investment banks and to appeal more to the buy side, commercial banks, insurance and corporates. I think they've done a nice job building a very, very broad reach in their customers that they serve. And they have no significant dependence on any one customer or customer type, which I think kind of gives more to the stability and future predictability of the business.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Okay. Thanks.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy, Raymond James. Your line is now open.", "Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. So a question on the tax benefit that you guys are going to be getting. Can you talk a little bit about the nature of that benefit and then how are you going to realize it? Is your GAAP tax rate going to be lower going forward or how do you actually benefit from that?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's basically just a step-up from the basis. So it will provide us some tax benefits within the United States, which is just \u2013 in a large part, which is our highest tax jurisdiction. And it will collectively give us a couple-tenths of improvement in our overall effective tax rate, which is helpful, so that's how it will come in over the next few years.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That plays out over a number of years.", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Oh, it's a number of years and this will stay (01:16:47), and that's why you really need to think about it on an NPV basis. I mean this benefit will be with us for about 15 years.", "Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "All right. Got it. Thank you. That makes sense. And then as far as the cash component of the deal, are you able to use any non-U.S. cash for that or is that basically going to more or less tap out the U.S. cash that you have on hand right now?", "Jack F. Callahan, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It will be mostly U.S. based deal in terms of cash. That's one reason why we do need to go to raise some new debt to fund the transaction.", "Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "All right, great. Thank you.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Great. Well, thank you, everyone. I know this has been a very long call and you might have some more questions, you can get to Chip later. We've covered a lot this morning on our acquisition announcement on SNL Financial. We also were able to go through the quarter, which we think was a very strong quarter from the point of view of margin improvement and continued for us to deliver what we've been talking about in the past. So thank you again, everybody, and good morning.", "Operator", "That concludes today's morning's call. A PDF version of the presenters' slides is available now for downloading from www.mhfi.com.

Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for McGraw Hill Financial's third quarter 2015 earnings call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer. This morning, we issued a news release with our third quarter results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management's.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at 212-438-1247 subsequent to this call.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Chip, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. This is a significant quarter for the company. We made excellent progress with our strategic initiative, including some very important decisions regarding our portfolio, while at the same time delivering solid top line and bottom-line results.", "But before I go into the strong results, let me cover some of the more strategic highlights from the quarter. We added SNL to our portfolio, which was funded with $2 billion of new notes and closed on September 1. We merged our S&P Capital IQ business with SNL and made several leadership changes, and we commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives for J.D. Power. And we have a great collection of assets. It's a portfolio that's now more focused on scalable, industry leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets.", "With the closing of the SNL transaction, work is underway to take advantage of the capabilities of both firms. The combination of S&P Capital IQ's broad data and powerful analytics with SNL's deep sector intelligence gives users unrivaled insights into the markets. As we execute our integration plans and learn more about SNL, we're identifying opportunities for additional synergies and are increasingly enthusiastic about the potential SNL brings to our company.", "Now, on this slide you can see, as previously announced, Mike Chinn will lead S&P Capital IQ and SNL. Mike is building a unified organization that drives creativity and innovation and delivers best-in-class performance. He has built a team which is made up of key leaders from the former SNL and S&P Capital IQ organizations, and Mike will manage the business from Charlottesville, Virginia.", "The integration of SNL is well underway. I head a steering committee that closely reviews key metrics to assess integration and synergy progress versus our plans. We've established a dedicated integration management office to support and accelerate our efforts to bring the two companies together with a mandate to deliver synergies that exceed the original deal thesis.", "Twelve integration work streams have been created, such as data, technology, and product and commercial strategies. In addition, we have more than 100 people across the organization working on the integration program. We believe SNL is a great asset and will unlock tremendous revenue opportunities and cost synergies, and we're on track to deliver or exceed our targeted synergies.", "Moving on to the next slide, recently we made a number of management changes. John Berisford, who has been one of the architects of the transformation of McGraw Hill Financial, is now President of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. John is well-suited to lead the ongoing transformation of the business in an increasingly regulated environment.", "Mike Chinn is leading S&P Capital IQ and SNL, as I just mentioned, and he is well-suited for this expanded role, having led SNL through a decade of consistent growth. Martina Cheung, who headed up our Global Strategy and Business Development area, is now Executive Managing Director of Global Risk Services. This is a business that's part of the intersection of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and S&P Capital IQ and SNL.", "Imogen Dillon Hatcher was just named President of Platts, and Imogen has been instrumental in positioning S&P Capital IQ for both growth and margin expansion. And now, we're looking forward to bringing her significant leadership experience to Platts.", "France Gingras is now the Executive Vice President of Human Resources, and France has a distinguished background in human resources with particular expertise in compensation and benefits. And last, David Goldenberg serves as Acting General Counsel. Prior to joining the company early this year, he held general counsel roles at Muzinich & Company, Mercer and Lazard Asset Management.", "Last week, we announced that we recently commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives for J.D. Power. This business is a household name in the U.S. It's a trusted source for new car quality and reliability ratings. It's headquartered in Westlake Village, California, and the business is currently estimated to have revenue of approximately $350 million in 2016, not only from the auto industry, but from other sectors: financial services, insurance, travel and healthcare. The business has roughly 800 employees globally.", "As MHFI has continued to evolve, we believe that J.D. Power could be more valuable as part of a market research and consumer analytics platform than by remaining in our portfolio. And the recent NADA Used Car Guide will add to that value.", "We haven't set a timetable because we want to run through a thoughtful, thorough, disciplined process to find the best fit for this business and its employees. Morgan Stanley will act as a financial adviser, and we'll provide an update at the appropriate time.", "As a result of this, as you'll see on this slide, our portfolio is now increasingly focused on businesses with a common set of attributes. The businesses are scalable; they are global; all have market-leading positions and fantastic brands; and serve growing markets. These businesses are increasingly interrelated and serving the capital and commodities markets. Together, it's this unique collection of great assets with these world-class brands that distinguishes McGraw Hill Financial.", "Now building on our solid first half, we continued to deliver strong financial results in the third quarter while simultaneously adding to our portfolio. During the quarter, the company delivered increased revenue, driven by the strength of the broad portfolio, continued margin expansion with 230 basis point improvement in our adjusted operating profit margin; a 15% increase in adjusted diluted EPS to $1.19; excellent cost control as our efficiency initiative combined with lower legal expense have enabled the company's adjusted expenses to increase less than 1% year-over-year; strong year-to-date free cash flow of $776 million, excluding after-tax payments associated with legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries; an increase of our 2015 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $4.45 to $4.50; and, a meaningful return of capital with share repurchases of 2.3 million shares in the quarter.", "This, combined with the 2.6 million shares in the first half, brings the year-to-date total to 4.9 million shares repurchased. The company accomplished all of this while investing in and encouraging a culture that emphasizes robust risk management and compliance with policies and regulations.", "Now, let's dig into the third quarter results. Revenue increased 5%. Excluding impact of foreign exchange, however, revenue increased 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 11%. Revenue growth, coupled with productivity initiatives, led to an adjusted operating margin increase of 230 basis points. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of prior year tax audits, and Jack will elaborate on this in a moment. All of this led to adjusted diluted EPS of $1.19, which is an increase of 16%.", "During the quarter, we had consistent profit improvement in every business segment. We did, however, experience a drop in revenue at Standard & Poor's Ratings, which declined due to weak third quarter bond issuance.", "Now, let's look at the individual businesses, and let me start with S&P Capital IQ and SNL. Revenue for the segment grew 14% including the contribution of SNL for the month of September. Organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter. While this is only one month of data, SNL delivered mid-teens revenue growth versus September 2014 when we did not own the company. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 25%. Solid revenue growth coupled with head count declines of 1% led to growth in adjusted operating margin, which increased 200 basis points to 23.8%.", "Because so much of the cost base of S&P Capital IQ and SNL is based outside the U.S., operating profit benefited from the stronger dollar. So, excluding the impact of forex, the adjusted operating margin was 22.2%. Not surprisingly, with the relative strength of the U.S. economy, domestic revenue growth outpaced international growth again this quarter.", "Let me add a bit more color on growth in the business lines of S&P Capital IQ and SNL. S&P Capital IQ Desktop & Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 9% primarily as a result of the low-teens increase in Desktop revenue. The number of Desktop users increased at low-teens to over 72,000 users. As we continue to leverage the breadth of capabilities within MHFI, S&P Capital IQ platform subscribers can now access Platts Bentek's Energy's oil and gas forecasts. With this addition, the S&P Capital IQ platform now features proprietary research from S&P Ratings, CRISIL and Platts' Bentek Energy, with other MHFI products to follow.", "For the month of September, SNL revenue increased 13% versus September 2014 when we did not own the company. The increase was driven by its Financial Institutions Group, both in the U.S. and overseas. S&P Credit Solutions revenue increased 7%, due primarily to the consistent growth in RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect. In the smallest category, S&P Capital IQ Markets Intelligence, revenue decreased 4% overall. Strong growth in Global Markets Intelligence and, to a lesser extent, Leveraged Commentary & Data was offset by declines in Equity Research Services.", "Now, let me turn to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. In the quarter, despite a meaningful decline in global issuance, revenue only decreased 3%, due in part to relationship-based contracts with our customers. Revenue grew, however, 1% excluding adverse forex. Issuance outside the U.S. was weak as concerns related to China's declining growth, falling commodity prices, and the Fed's impending interest rate hike hindered issuance activity.", "For the fourth straight quarter, international revenue lagged domestic revenue growth with a decline of 14%. Adjusted operating profit grew 5% and adjusted margin improvement continued with a 380 basis point improvement of 47.8%. This improvement was the result of decreased expenses primarily related to legal, recent restructurings and efforts to leverage lower cost locations. While revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates, it had less of an impact on operating profit.", "Now, turning to the next slide, non-transaction revenue reached a quarterly record of $343 million due to an increased demand for rating evaluation services from robust U.S. M&A activity and strength at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue increased from 55% to 58% of total revenue and was the highest percentage of quarterly revenue that non-transaction has represented since the first quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, non-transaction revenue increased 8%.", "Transaction revenue weakness was driven by a 20% decline in global issuance. Bank loan ratings revenue was also weak, decreasing 16% due to a reduction of leveraged recapitalizations and refinancings partially due to leveraged lending regulatory guidance on the loan market. Two areas of strength were U.S. investment grade issuance led by robust M&A activity and U.S. public finance. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, transaction revenue decreased 7%.", "As you can see on this slide, Asia and Latin America issuance decreased by 58% and 72%, respectively. This led to a 20% decline in global issuance overall. To put that in perspective, both Asia and Latin America had their lowest quarterly issuance since 2008. Due to the turmoil in the Asian markets and the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, year-over-year quarterly revenue from China experienced a decline for the first time in the last five years. In addition, this was Europe's lowest issuance quarter since the third quarter of 2013.", "But when we look at third quarter U.S. issuance, which increased 1%, the strongest category is U.S. industrial investment grade companies, which set a third quarter record due to a number of jumbo M&A transactions. The other bright spot was a 5% increase in public finance issuance. These gains were largely offset by a 43% decrease in high yield and a 27% decrease in structured finance, which had weaknesses in most asset classes.", "In Europe, excluding sovereigns, issuance decreased 4%; investment grade declined 31% and high yield declined 14%. Structured finance issuance increased 98% with a surge in RMBS and had strength in every asset class except CLOs.", "Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the business delivered a 9% increase in revenue due primarily to a sharp increase in exchange-traded derivative volume in the quarter. This growth was supported by ETF mutual funds and data license revenue, which all increased. The only area with a revenue decline was in over-the-counter derivatives primarily due to the loss of the UBS contract last year.", "As the volatility of equity markets intensified during the quarter, trading volumes of exchange-traded derivatives contracts increased. Importantly, inflows into U.S. equity ETFs resumed this quarter. Adjusted operating profit increased 18% and the adjusted operating profit margin increased 500 basis points to 68.5%.", "The trend from active to passive investing has continued in 2015 with year-to-date ETF industry inflows setting a record of $230 billion. It's very encouraging that, after a brief pause, inflows into U.S. equity turned positive in the third quarter, totaling $28 billion.", "ETF assets under management associated with our indices increased 2% to $749 billion versus the end of the quarter of 2014, but remains below peak levels of $832 billion at the end of 2014. During the quarter, S&P Dow Jones Indices introduced 107 new indices as it continues to expand its index families. Over the past year, the number of ETFs based upon our indices increased by 45 to 660.", "Market volatility led to a surge in exchange-traded activity, with exchange rate derivative volumes based on S&P Dow Jones indices increasing 32%. You know the key products driving this increase. It was the E-mini, the VIX and the SPX, all which had volume increases of 27%, 42% and 36%, respectively.", "This slide depicts two charts that we've shown you before. They should be instructive in understanding year-to-year ETF industry flows. In the chart on the left, you see the AUM linked to ETFs based on our indices has declined recently. While the year-over-year comparison are still positive, AUM has declined since the end of 2014. The chart on the right shows that inflows into passively managed ETFs continue to be robust. In fact, the industry experienced record first nine months' inflows of $230 billion.", "In the first half of this year, unfortunately, ETF flows moved to European and non-U.S. products where we have less exposure. In the third quarter, inflows into products based upon our indices, fortunately, resumed. While it's encouraging that inflows into our AUM increased, as you can see on the bar chart on the left, AUM was down sequentially due to a decline in equity prices.", "In the Commodities and Commercial Markets segment, revenue grew 9% with organic growth of 5%, excluding revenue from Petromedia and NADA Used Car Guide acquisition. And this was led by high-single-digit revenue growth at Platts. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 11%. Adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 37.3%.", "Excluding the NADA Used Car Guide acquisition, J.D. Power revenue declined primarily due to weakness in China. Platts continues to deliver strong results with high-single-digit revenue growth despite the negative impact of continued low commodity prices. In fact, petroleum products recorded low-teens revenue growth.", "Due to recent investments, metals, agriculture and petrochemicals continued to deliver the highest revenue growth rates. Global Trading Services revenue increased primarily due to the timing of license fees from revisions to pricing terms on existing agreement and license revenue from The Steel Index derivative activity.", "In summary, this was an important quarter. We've built a portfolio of scalable industry-leading interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets. The addition of SNL contributes nicely to the portfolio. We announced the realignment of S&P Capital IQ and SNL businesses and several leadership changes. We continued progress on productivity efforts across the company. We delivered increased revenue, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS. We increased 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.45 to $4.50. We generated considerable year-to-date free cash flow, excluding after-tax payments associated with legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries. And we maintained our commitment to meaningful capital return with increased share repurchase activity. And as announced, we're initiating a process to explore strategic alternatives for J.D. Power.", "With that, I want to thank you for joining the call this morning, and I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our CFO.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. As you just heard from Doug, there has been a great deal of continued progress building an ever more focused and capable McGraw Hill Financial while continuing to deliver strong financial performance. Today, I want to add some color to several items related to our financial performance, and then we will open the call up for your questions.", "First, I'll recap key financial results and review certain adjustments to earnings that were recorded during the quarter. Next, I will clarify the impact from acquisition-related amortization and foreign exchange. After that, I will review important changes to the balance sheet and progress year-to-date on free cash flow and return of capital. And finally, I will update our 2015 guidance.", "Let's start with the consolidated third quarter income statement. Overall, these were solid results, particularly the continuing progress in margin improvement. Revenue grew 5% as the balance of the portfolio offset a modest decline at Standard & Poor's Ratings and the continued headwinds from foreign exchange, which reduced our growth rate by about 2 points. Adjusted consolidated operating profit grew 11% with all four businesses contributing to this growth. Adjusted operating margins approached 40%, up 230 basis points from a year ago. Revenue growth combined with the continued progress on our productivity initiatives resulted in this improvement.", "Adjusted unallocated expenses did increase 11%, largely due to professional fees in support of several enterprise-wide initiatives. The tax rate on an adjusted basis was 28.8%. This was unusually low due to favorable outcomes from the resolution of certain prior year tax audits, which generated a positive impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.06. We now expect a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 31.5%.", "And finally, both adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16%. EPS was $1.19. The average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 1 million shares versus a year ago.", "Now, let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. In total, pre-tax adjustments to earnings from continuing operations totaled $118 million. This consisted of $86 million in net accruals for potential settlements, offset in part by insurance recoveries, and approximately $32 million for acquisition-related costs associated with the SNL transaction.", "We recognize that investors use different methods for evaluating McGraw Hill Financial and that understanding the amount of acquisition-related amortization can be important in these evaluations. Going forward, we intend to provide you with a clear detail to assist you in the analysis.", "In the table on the top, we show pre-tax amortization expense of $17 million and adjusted EBITDA of $565 million for the third quarter. In the lower table, we show after-tax amortization expense of $11 million and adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization expense, of $1.22 for the third quarter.", "We are now further along in the purchase price accounting for SNL. The annualized amortization expense due to the SNL acquisition is anticipated to be approximately $53 million. During the third quarter, we recorded just one month of amortization expense related to SNL, so the overall impact is negligible.", "The level of amortization expense will become more pronounced in the fourth quarter as we record three months of SNL-related acquisition expense. Please note that our guidance for the balance of 2015 does include the impact of this amortization.", "Let me turn to foreign exchange. Foreign exchange continues to have a negative impact on the company's revenue. Reported international revenues decreased 5%. However, on a constant currency basis, international revenue actually increased 1%. The majority of this impact was realized within Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Overall, on a constant-currency basis, total company revenue increased 7%, 2 points faster than the reported results. Expenses incurred outside the United States also decreased, providing a modest positive impact on adjusted operating profit totaling less than $0.01 of EPS.", "Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which appropriately 90% was held outside the United States. In August, the company issued $2 billion of notes of various maturities at a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%. We were quite pleased with the strong execution behind this financing and the strong response from investors given the ongoing volatility in the market. This increased our outstanding long-term debt to appropriately $3.5 billion, all of which is rated investment grade. Our gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is now approximately 1.6 times.", "Now, let's turn to cash flow and the return of capital. Our year-to-date free cash flow was negative $497 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations excluding the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries, year-to-date free cash flow was a positive $776 million. We remain on track with our full year 2015 free cash flow guidance of greater than $1.1 billion.", "During the quarter, the company stepped up its share repurchase program and bought 2.3 million shares, bringing the year-to-date total to 4.9 million shares. The share repurchase program remains an important component of our overall capital allocation and we anticipate continuing to repurchase shares under our remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately 40.6 million shares, subject to market conditions. Through nine months of 2015, the total capital returned was $775 million, surpassing the $607 million at this time last year.", "Finally, I would like to close by updating our 2015 guidance. We anticipated that our productivity programs would have a clear impact on margins this year. Our strong performance year-to-date leads us to increase our adjusted operating margin guidance to an improvement of more than 200 basis points.", "As I discussed earlier, due to the favorable benefit from the resolution of prior year tax audits, we are lowering our adjusted tax rate guidance to approximately 31.5%. Therefore, based on the strong results in the quarter, we are increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.45 to $4.50. However, we are cautious given the uneven trends in bond issuance as we close out the year and the volatility across the capital markets.", "In closing, we continue to focus on creating growth and driving performance. Our actions demonstrate our commitment to building upon an extraordinary portfolio of assets, improving margins and returning cash to shareholders. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning, and I'll turn it back over to Chip for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jack. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. I would kindly ask you to limit yourself to two questions. That's two questions each in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take the first question.", "Operator", "Alex Kramm, UBS, your line is open.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just want to start with J.D. Power, actually. I think this doesn't come as a total surprise, but I want to talk about \u2013 or ask about the timing a little bit here. I mean, you just completed the NADA acquisition recently, or NADA, and it seems like that's kind part of that business.", "So, just want to ask what changed in the commitment considering that you just did an acquisition there and now you're looking to potentially divest this business? It seems like a little bit of a flip flop. And then, maybe just in terms of the numbers from J.D. Power, EBITDA around $50 million, is that fair? And what would you do with the proceeds?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Alex. It's Jack. First, (32:50) about the Used Car Guide. Look, that was a great addition to the J.D. Power portfolio. We'd been in discussions for quite some time. It really adds and broadens the capability of the PIN business that sits within J.D. Power, which is maybe one of the most valuable assets within it. So, it was a great opportunity and we're pleased with the progress that we've seen so far in the integration; and a great addition to the organization.", "Relative to timing, we don't have a strict timetable. We are just beginning the process. We have engaged an advisor. We do anticipate that we'll be reaching out to various parties in the coming weeks. And we have no gun to our head to get it done overnight, but at the same time we don't want this process to linger. So we hope to move it forward as we get into the early part of next year.", "Relative to your question on margins, next year in 2016, our current view is that the business on a revenue basis will be approaching $350 million in revenue. And once \u2013 and we still have some work to do to get the stand-up EBITDA margins. But I do think we'll have stand-up EBITDA margins of approximately approaching 20% as we get into next year. And, you know, we look \u2013 this will be a nice inflow to U.S. cash, which is something that we are \u2013 we're tightly managing the balance sheet right now and using that available U.S. cash, if there's not tuck-in acquisitions available, returning that cash to shareholders.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Fantastic. Thanks for the detailed answer. And then, secondly, want to go back to the slide of the leadership reorganization. Unfortunately, the slide is not up anymore, but it looks to me like you created a new position sitting between Capital IQ and Ratings. So, maybe you can just talk a little bit more about what you're doing there, in particular as it seems like, relative to your primary competitor, your revenues (34:57) through Capital IQ is much lower than theirs. So, any goals of bringing this up substantially in the next one year to three years? Thank you.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. This is Doug. So, we have created a new business which is underneath the S&P Capital IQ Group, which is called Global Risk Services. The woman who's going to be leading it is named Martina Cheung. She is going to continue to report to Mike Chinn. She is going to be part of our Executive Committee. We have an Executive Committee that meets almost weekly, three times to four times a month, that talks about all of our key strategic initiatives, how we're going to be investing in the company, where we're going to be growing, et cetera. So Martina is reporting to Mike Chinn, but she's joining our Executive Committee because this is such an important growth initiative for us.", "So the way we look at this, there is a very large demand for increased information inside of financial institutions, as well as corporates, for risk components, risk data, in some cases, liquidity information, et cetera. And we're pulling together all of the different assets that we have that are related to that type of information and putting them under Martina. And that's basically what the role is that she's going to be taking on.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber, Huber Research. Your line is open.", "Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC", "Yes. Good morning. A few questions, if I could. First one here, the synergies you talked about here of $70 million-plus by 2019 for SNL, can you just give us further update on how that breaks down between costs and revenue? And why 2019? That just seems like an eternity here. I mean, why can't this get done within, say, 18 months? I have some follow ups, too. Thank you.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think for today, just kind of going back to the original assumptions that we put out there, to your point, it's $70 million in EBITDA by 2019, we are pointing currently to sort of an even mix between cost and revenue that support that assumption at the time of the acquisition. That all being said, I think both Doug and I are enormously encouraged by the enthusiasm by which, collectively, both the legacy S&P Capital IQ and the SNL team are working together to forge a new and integrated organization. And we announced that very soon after the closing of the acquisition. And they're deeply (37:32) at work, detailing and updating that synergy case. And we hope to have a more complete update for investors when we get to our next call.", "But I would say at this time we're highly encouraged that we have great confidence in the $70 million. We are pointing to an upside to that number, both in terms of aggregate amount and timing. And I think with the decision we've made to move towards an integrated organization, I think there should be some upside, particularly as it relates to cost synergies.", "Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC", "And then, also, what is holding you guys back? I get this question a lot from investors. What's holding you back from buying a lot more stock than you've bought back in the last three quarters, particularly with your stock trading in the low-double digits on EBITDA basis? Then, you go out and do what a lot of people and investors perceive is a very expensive acquisition at a few times that multiple. Why aren't you buying back stock a lot more aggressively here, particularly at these price levels?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, you know what? I would just point to \u2013 we did step up our share repurchase activity in the third quarter, despite the fact that at the same time we were completing the SNL acquisition. And I think we agree with investors that we do have balance sheet flexibility as we go forward. And we do believe that continued share repurchase will be important part of our capital allocation in the fourth quarter and as we move forward into next year.", "Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC", "And then, my last question, please. What is your outlook for the bond ratings business, for the transaction revenues here for, say, the next three months? Are you seeing any green shoots here or anything?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, this is Doug. Just in terms of the mix that we've seen over the last year, as you saw on the slides, and all of you know because you track it very carefully, issuance has been \u2013 the story of issuance has been very mixed this year. And as you know, total global issuance was down 20% in the third quarter with different puts and takes in terms of how they came out.", "So far, October started off very weak. It was a weak month with issuance. So, we're cautious about the fourth quarter overall. There were some large issuance related to M&A as well as some, what I call, synthetic repatriations where corporations have a lot of offshore cash they don't bring back, but they do borrow domestically.", "In the last week or so we saw Microsoft, ACE. There's continued to be a robust pipeline of municipal and public finance issuers, like Texas and Florida. So, we're not projecting anything right now. It's hard to see. Some of the same conditions which made the third quarter very volatile, like the questions about what's going to happen to the U.S. interest rate; when is Yellen going to increase interest rates; what kind of impact that's going to have, what are some of the emerging markets' volatility factors, China, Brazil, et cetera; what's happening with the banking market? There's a new initiative which was released last week from the Fed for U.S. banks about resolution and recovery planning, which has new guidance about TLAC.", "In addition, in Europe, they're looking at TLAC, which is the total loss-absorbing capacity of the large financial institutions. Depending on where that comes out, that might drive more issuance. But we're looking at a lot of different factors. I don't want to give you a forecast, but I'd tell you that we're seeing \u2013 we saw a slow start to October, a very robust end of October. But generally speaking, in the fourth quarter, we are going to be watching interest rates, inflation numbers, TLAC, China, Europe, et cetera; and we're cautious.", "Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Doug Arthur, Huber Research, your line is now open.", "Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC", "Yeah. Thanks. Jack, it looks like cost \u2013 adjusted cost at S&P or in the Ratings Group was down 9% in the quarter. Can you just sort of break that down in terms of the currency \u2013 whether you had a currency benefit? How much is that is year-over-year drop in legal costs, and how much of it is productivity? Thanks.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Sure, Doug. A good part of it is related back \u2013 as you may remember, back in the third and fourth quarter of 2014 we had a couple of restructuring actions at Ratings. Those restructuring actions are making a significant contribution to this expense management that you're seeing this year. In terms of \u2013 we have seen some benefits from reduced legal expense, but, to a large part, a good part of that benefit has been offset with some selective investments in areas of compliance as we are working to tighten up some of our processes there. So it's been a couple of moving pieces.", "And overall, in terms of forex impact on Ratings, there's not a big part \u2013 I mean, there is a benefit, but it's \u2013 actually, on a profit basis, forex within Ratings \u2013 forex was actually \u2013 caused a modest \u2013 hit profits of a couple million dollars. Because we had \u2013 that's also the business where we have the most significant forex impact on the top line, and the savings that we get on the expense side are not enough to offset that.", "Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC", "And just as a follow-up, in terms of total cost year-over-year for the company in the quarter, how much \u2013 you may have said this, but how much did FX benefit or not benefit the year-over-year relationship? Thanks.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "As I mentioned, the total profit impact of forex was a modest positive, less than a $0.01 of EPS. So in large part, the revenue hit that we took, which was about 2 points of growth, was to a large part offset by the impact on expenses.", "Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Denny Galindo, Morgan Stanley, your line is open.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, there. I wanted to delve a little bit more into Ratings. Your numbers were a little bit worse than your big competitor, and I wanted to understand if you guys had more exposure to LatAm and Asia, where you saw some weakness, than your global peer? And then, they also called out CMBS as an area of strength. Did that \u2013 is it kind of a lag in CMBS hurt the numbers as well?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. This is Doug. So, the main sources of differences of the top-line are related to CMBS, and a little bit of CLOs and CDOs, on the structured finance business, and then there was a slight difference to what we could see in Europe; but generally speaking, those are the main differences.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, I wanted to talk about margins a little bit. With the shift in the leadership in the Ratings division, margins have been doing really well, especially with revenue down. But will there be any differences in your approach to margin improvement? Will there be more reliance on pricing or any changes at all there to what you've been doing in margin expansion for Ratings?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There's no expectations we're changing any of our approaches, although we are watching very carefully what's the outlook for issuance. So I don't know what kind of top line growth we're going to have. As I mentioned before, I'm cautious about expectations on what's going to be happening in the markets with issuance, generally speaking. We do have a continued focus on margins, on efficiency, and the new president of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services is committed to continuing to manage the business in a way that does look at the bottom line.", "On the other hand, we are looking at ways that we can improve some of our workflow, have more automated approaches to some of the ways that we deliver information to the markets. So it's possible that we will be investing in technology and automation to improve our overall performance; but maybe we'll see some investments in that.", "But generally speaking, let me say that for Ratings and all of our businesses we're committed to continuing to drive margin improvement. And over time, that's something we're going to look at, but I can't guarantee you that we're always going to get that if the markets themselves are not going up and our growth is not delivering.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, switching gears to Index, I've never really thought of Index as a place where the margins could go even higher. It's usually Capital IQ and Ratings. But your competitor recently released margins and they were a little bit higher than yours. I've always thought of you as more innovative, more investments in new products like fixed income, indices. Is that what \u2013 at least the difference between your margins and your big competitor, or is there something else, maybe the mix of subscription revenue, risk trading revenue; maybe just any thoughts on the difference between your margins and theirs?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Denny, one thing that you may want to check \u2013 I don't have it in front of me, but you may just want to check. I think when that particular competitor talked about their margin, I think they excluded the impact of D&A. So I think they were EBITDA margins. So I'm not sure it's quite apples to apples.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "(47:25) something like 1% or so, right?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I think it's enough to close the gap. So I think that's the best part of the story.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And last one, with energy markets declining, customers cutting back, are you seeing anything new in the acquisition pipeline that you could add in terms of energy? It seems like there must be some assets that you can get a little bit cheaper than usual at this time.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "When it comes to our acquisition pipeline, we have a disciplined process to keep our eyes on different opportunities in the U.S. and around the globe. We are always, obviously, looking at ideas. We have nothing that \u2013 we've said before, we have a lot of work to do right now with SNL. That's our top priority, is integration, as well as working to ensure that we have a very smooth process with J.D. Power. So right now, our top priorities are to shape the portfolio in the direction that we've discussed today.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That's it for me. Thanks.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray, your line is now open.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning. So, Doug, just continuing on the margin theme, the results have been very impressive, obviously, across the portfolio. So I'm wondering if you're rethinking what the upside might be longer term and if you can quantify it for us in terms of the various segments where you see the upside?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think that that's one of the things that we're working on right now as, typically, you might hear from a lot of corporations. In our fourth quarter, we're looking at a three-year to five-year strategic plan and, very importantly, now going to come up with a one-year approach. So in February next year when we do our full year earnings, we'll also be presenting our guidance for 2016. And I would \u2013 if you don't mind, I'd rather defer my thinking on that question until we've had a chance to put in place our 2016 expectations; but Jack wants to add something.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Peter, just one obvious point, though, I just want to add to Doug's comment. As you know, we do see the newly integrated S&P Capital IQ, SNL business segment as a business unit that we would anticipate some sustained margin expansion going forward. And back to Doug's comment, I think we'll put some more specifics and guardrails on that when we get into our guidance view for 2016.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Got it. Understood. And then unrelated, in the structured finance market I think you're exclusion from the CMBS market ends in the beginning of 2016. Should that have some measurable impact on your operating results next year?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "As of right now, I don't know and I'm not \u2013 it's not something I can really talk about, yet.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "You can't talk about it because you don't know how it's going to play out or...?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Because of the agreements that we have with the government on our ability to talk about that business.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Oh, I see. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Tim McHugh, William Blair, your line is open.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thanks. I guess, just coming back to SNL, you'd, I guess, hinted at some potential for upside and I guess it was something you feel better about. And I think it was more about the cost, but can you elaborate more on it? Is it about the cost of SNL and the ability to improve their margins, or are you feeling better about the synergies with Cap IQ? I guess, what makes you feel better about \u2013 enough to hint at upside in terms of the timing and size of the profit contribution from that business?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Jack. So first of all, this is literally only about a month, two months since we've been working with Mike Chinn. And as we did the due diligence and got to know the business very well over a period during the second and third quarter this year, we were always impressed with SNL and their operating capacity, as well as what we saw as the ways to merge these businesses and get a lot more out of both of them.", "So through that, now that we've got this very thorough integration management office in place, where we're tracking 12 projects with some of them with other subprojects and driving that very intensively faster than anybody expected, I can guarantee you that people did not expect that we were going to put Mike Chinn in charge of both businesses within eight days of closing the transaction. And so, we are really serious about this, and we're driving it fast and hard.", "You already answered the question in your question itself by where we're finding the opportunities. We're finding them both in cost in both businesses, ways we can do things more efficiently. We're finding them in revenue opportunities. We're also able to work more closely with some other projects Jack is driving about how we manage the corporate center; but let me see what else Jack wants to add.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, look, I think the thing that gives us the confidence, Tim, more than anything is the speed at which, to Doug's point, that we've moved to integrate the organization, building sort of the best from both organizations. And when you move away from the outside in, evaluation of synergies, to the inside out, and you're starting to see the detail behind it and the clear accountability and a better sense of the timing to realize, I just think today, two months post-close, we feel better than ever about the synergy case; and we hope to have more insight for you in our next call.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And on Platts, can you elaborate? Obviously, it's good performance in the face of a tough environment. Is it the pricing initiatives you had talked about maybe a year or so ago, I guess, but what \u2013 that or what else, I guess, is really contributing to the growth, and particularly, I guess, in the petroleum sector right now?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes; so a couple of things. Clearly, it's a matter of many, many different factors. It's a much more concerted effort on the commercial side where we've got a \u2013 with the combination of Larry and, now, Imogen in place looking at how we can be very customer-focused, have a good approach to sales, pricing, discipline, et cetera. It's also something that is maybe not \u2013 is maybe a little bit counterintuitive, but even though the price of oil is down very low, there still are a lot of winners. It's not just the losers that are hit by the market. You have people that are also consumers downstream in the environment of oil industry, airlines, the travel/leisure industry, et cetera, that are big consumers of data and analytics and pricing from commodity space that are beneficiaries of the lower prices that also have a lot of demand for the data.", "So we are finding that the demand is not necessarily dropping as dramatically as you would expect given the volatility and the lowering of the prices. But we are very carefully, obviously, watching the number of seats, the kind of cost initiatives that could be going on in a lot of the firms to ensure that we're prepared for, potentially, a weaker environment. But through many, many different initiatives, we're pleased that we're still driving the growth.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Vincent Hung, Autonomous, your line is now open.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Hi. Good morning. I'll keep it to two questions. Firstly, can you talk about what John has already done in his short time as President of the Ratings business and what his priorities as President will be going forward?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. So John is \u2013 just to tell you a little bit more about John since you asked the question, John has been with us for over five years. He was instrumental in helping drive the transformation of McGraw Hill Financial and the sale of the publishing and non-core assets. He knows all of our leaders across the firm. He's a very strategic manager with excellent project management and executional capabilities.", "So John's main focus has been to continue the programs and progress that Neeraj Sahai had been making in how we're managing the workflow, managing the business, ensuring that we are responsive to the markets and our customers, and very, very importantly that we have in place regulatory and risk programs that meet the requirements of all of the new regulations that have been coming up around the world.", "So John's priorities have not changed from Neeraj's. But in terms of how he's managing the place, he's spending a lot of time in the field, walking the floors, learning the business as quickly as he can; although, he's off to a \u2013 he was able to hit a running start because he already knows the business well. But John, as I said, priorities haven't changed but maybe his style and how he's getting it done is a little bit different. And he's getting a lot of visibility with the troops and energizing the organization.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Okay. And just lastly, what is going so right in Capital IQ Desktop in light of the strength in user growth?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, just \u2013 there's nothing really new there. In the last three years, if you look at the user growth on the desktop, it's basically most quarters been kind of a low teen growth number. So, we're just continuing to penetrate a marketplace that is increasingly appreciative of the additions we've made to that product. It's a great price point and it's an ever better product.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd add to that that there is also continued international growth, so that there's more penetration, as always, continuing overseas. And when you look at a lot of the customers, there's a lot of them who are trying to understand what are the requirements of their internal data needs and which is the product that best serves those needs, looking at some of the competitors, and we're also winning out a lot of those reviews against some of the other maybe more expensive competitors or those that have different products and services that don't necessarily meet the needs of the users on the floors.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Andre Benjamin, Goldman Sachs, your line is open.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. I wanted to know if you could maybe talk a little bit about where you stand in terms of continuing to add fixed income indices. I know you called out Indices and the business up quarter-over-quarter. I didn't know how much of that was fixed income, and then how much that business is contributing to the overall revenue pot today?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, we continue to have \u2013 this is one of our key growth areas. So, when we look at the index business, if I were to over simplify our growth approach, it's to the international expansion, which we talk about a lot and we had some recent wins there in Chile and some other markets where we're growing out our international expansion. The second is fixed income indices. The fixed income indices today is \u2013 represents a...", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "About $30 billion of the AUM.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "$30 billion of the AUM. It's not a large \u2013 it's not a significant factor in our top line growth, but today \u2013 our top line results. But we are \u2013 it's an area that we think that \u2013 if you go to the wealth managers, in particular, and you look at the secular trends of the baby boomers retiring, the needs for different types of products beyond just the buying bonds directly and other sorts of benchmarks, we're continuing to see this as a top priority for us even though it has not produced a lot of growth right now \u2013 or a lot of income. It is something that we're positioning for because we want to get ahead of that opportunity.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I have a little bit more specifics to follow up on the Capital IQ question you just answered. In terms of the growth, is it really broad-based across both fixed income and equity products? And then, who are you finding that you're taking share from? I mean, the markets are not up double digits and your competitors have generally talked about a more benign environment. So, I guess, where are you seeing that you're getting the most share gains?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're getting the most share gain in analytical-type roles. So it's both fixed income and equities, and it's also risk management. And so, these are areas that we're continuing to see growth. I can't tell you directly if we're taking share from somebody else, but we're finding that we can penetrate those areas, analytical roles \u2013 mid-level and junior level analytical roles at banks, investment banks, asset managers, some corporations, et cetera. So, we're pleased with the growth we're seeing, and we've got an aggressive sales program out to call on our customers and identify where they can use our products.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo, your line is open.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of housekeeping items for me, I think. Just double checking the organic constant currency growth, looks like it was about 5% reported, 7% constant currency, 3 points from acquisitions, would give you about 4%. Am I doing that right?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Pretty close. I think it's pretty \u2013 it rounds closer to 5%, but...", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "5%? Okay.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...the general approach you're going at makes \u2013 is about right.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, if I could then, the share count exiting Q3, because I know you \u2013 it looked like you bought back a bunch later in the quarter so...", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. We did \u2013 we were buying. So, basic share count as we ended Q3 was 271 million.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And with the dilution?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "On a fully diluted, it was 274 million.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "274 million. Great. That does it for me. Thanks a lot.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Bill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. The first one, just on Pratts, in the context of some of your peers reporting sort of the divergence between the subscription and non-subscription performance of the business, I apologize if I missed it, but can you talk about sort of the growth on subscription and non-subscription and how that tallied to the total that you talked about?", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "There's really very little of that business that's non-subscription, so roughly 90% of that business is a subscription business. So we're not impacted by reduction in consulting fees of that nature. The other 10% is really on the derivative trading side. That's going to be the contracts that are traded at the major exchanges, like the ICE Exchange and the Singapore Exchange, which in the quarter did quite well. I mean, as you know, volatility bodes well for that business.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. I think that's what I was trying to get to, though. So like sometimes, that number can be really high and obviously skew that total result. So that's what I was just trying to understand, like \u2013 I mean, is it fair to say that the subscription was at par with the total that you talked about?", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Subscriptions at par with the total you talked about?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Look, I think we did see relatively faster growth in the non-transaction part of the Platts business, but the fact that that's only approaching 10% of the overall mix, there's limits to how much it can impact the overall number. So, in balance, we saw pretty good growth in the subscription business. It was high-single digits.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then...", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "So, the derivatives side increased double-digit, but to Jack's point, it's only 10%. So it's nice growth, but it can only move the needle so far.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, Okay. I understood. And then, Doug, just sort of bigger picture, I mean, you know the management slide that you had out there, I think you sort of had a similar slide when you first began with another team. So, I was just trying to understand like \u2013 in terms of the evolution of your few years as CEO now, like is this \u2013 are there more changes to be coming? And then, just on the departure of Lucy, was just curious if we should take that as an indication of there's not a lot more legal work left to be done?", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think that \u2013 first of all, I believe that this is a young company, even though we have a very long legacy; over 125 years as McGraw Hill and 150 years with S&P businesses. We think that it is a young company. We've only been in this configuration for two years, and it's only been eight months since the time of the Department of Justice settlement.", "So I'm very pleased with the team that we're building. We have a \u2013 and I think team is the right word. People get along very well. We're aligned on how \u2013 what our purpose is and what our goals and objectives are going forward. I don't have any expectations that we have management changes underway. We have a lot of people in new jobs. So if there's one thing that I'm spending a lot of time on with the team is to ensure that the people in new jobs have the resources that they need, that they've got the approach to leading and managing their teams that's going to be successful. So, I don't \u2013 I really think that it's a great team without any \u2013 with no changes in place.", "On the legal department's role, I do think that we have a meaningful shift in what would have been a year ago versus today's approach to the legal department. As you know, we used to include in our earnings releases every month a list of all of the legal cases. We had very significant litigation with the Department of Justice and the states, et cetera. So as we settle into a \u2013 more of a BAU approach with a little bit of legacy litigation, we are pleased that we have a legal department that is an advisory department, helping us grow the businesses and looking more forward with a future approach as opposed to a legacy approach.", "That doesn't mean that we're not going to ensure we have all of the best resources available and the best minds to settle the final little pieces of litigation here and there, but really, team focus across the entire team; want to make sure everybody's successful and that we're focused now on growth and performance.", "Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from Bill Bird, FBR. Your line is open.", "Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Good morning. Thank you. I have two questions related to S&P Ratings. One, how much cost flexibility do you have should the operating environment change and should you need to reduce costs quickly?", "And then, second, you had great growth in non-transaction revenues. Could you just speak to kind of the durability of that growth? Thank you.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. So first of all, on the cost flexibility, we \u2013 this isn't just a question for Ratings. We actually look at this for every business, and there's obviously opportunities which any company has when they're approving their budgets which relate to head count. Do you have, for instance, growth areas that you would slow down the growth? Do you have the opportunity if people left, if there's attrition, not to replace the attrition? I mean, these are traditional and typical tools that you use to address any sort of opportunities if you need to slow down your expense growth. Another one could be if you have any major initiatives which you're undertaking, can you also slow them down or delay them or cancel them?", "In addition, we have \u2013 if the performance is not going very well, you obviously have not \u2013 you're not going to be accruing the same level of compensation and bonus accruals and things like that, which is another opportunity.", "We also have other projects which we're, obviously, always looking at. I mentioned in my comments that we're looking to see how we can leverage lower cost operations in the U.S. and around the globe to make sure that we're also finding the best mix of costs so we can still support all of our businesses and our customers.", "So those \u2013 there's a lot of those tools, and I say it's not just Ratings. That goes for every business we've got, that we're always looking for that kind of flexibility. And as I've said before, we always feel like we need to be prepared and we want to be able to control what we can control.", "Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Thanks. And the other question was just related to the strong growth you had in non-transaction revenues.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Oh, sorry. Yeah, on non-transaction, so we had a \u2013 there were a couple of reasons for that. One was there was a \u2013 you know, because of all the M&A activity around the globe, we had a large increase in Ratings Evaluation Services. Those are coming from the M&A activities in the U.S., in Europe, et cetera. So that was one of the main drivers of the increase in that area.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And also, too \u2013 that's also where we \u2013 our CRISIL results are largely \u2013 in CRISIL, well, it was a \u2013 it had very nice growth in sort of mid-teens area. So that was another good contribution.", "Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "So, would you characterize the growth in that line as maybe elevated above normal and likely to moderate? Or is there anything else going on?", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "If you look historically, I mean, most of the time that line is kind of in the mid-single digits. So we've had periods we're a little below it, you know, the last couple of quarters, but mid-single digits is, in the long run, is kind of a reasonable area for that line item.", "Bill G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Douglas L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Bill, and let me thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We were very pleased with our results, obviously, as I said. Going forward, we're going to be focusing the company on these four pillars of scale businesses that are very interrelated, that have excellent brands focused on global growth. And we look forward to speaking with you at the end of the year when we have our next quarter. And clearly there's a few questions that we need to get back to you on when we launch our 2016 \u2013 when we give you our guidance. But we really appreciate all of your questions and your support, and we look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "That concludes today's \u2013 this morning's call.

Sir, you may begin.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the McGraw Hill Financials Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO, and Jack Callahan, the Chief Financial Officer. This morning we issued a news release with our first quarter 2016 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at www.mhfi.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we'll provide an adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measure and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.", "In addition, I want to remind you that we now exclude deal-related amortization from our non-GAAP results.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates, and descriptions of future events.

Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of McGraw Hill Financial should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company.", "We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call, however, this call is intended for investors. And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger in our New York office at (212) 438-1247 subsequent to this call.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. This morning Jack and I will review our first quarter results. More broadly, however, want to share the progress made at the company as we increasingly focus on providing essential benchmark data and analytics to the financial and commodity markets.", "Let me begin with the highlights of the first quarter. The strength of our portfolio was displayed, as we delivered solid EPS growth despite weak global debt issuance. We completed our portfolio refinement with announcements that we have reached definitive agreements to sell J.D. Power for $1.1 billion to XIO Group and Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc. and Credit Market Analysis to Intercontinental Exchange.", "A top priority in 2016 is the integration of SNL. We made tremendous strides with both the integration and the progress on important synergy targets. We delivered a 130 basis point improvement in the company's adjusted operating profit margin. Our share repurchases resulted in a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of 9 million shares over the past year. And, finally, we are prepared for changing the name of the company to S&P Global tomorrow. This new name better reflects the company's global footprint and premium portfolio.", "Now, let's take a closer look at the first quarter results. While reported revenue grew 5%, organic revenue on a constant currency basis was unchanged. Weakness in S&P Rating Services revenue was offset by growth in every other business, with particular strength in Platts and SNL. The company delivered 130 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as the result of the addition of SNL and tremendous progress made toward achieving SNL integration synergy targets.", "Margin improvement and share repurchases enabled the company to record an 8% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. In the first quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in margins, except for Standard & Poor's Rating Services. What is most notable, however, is the financial improvement in Market Intelligence.", "Now, let me turn to the individual businesses, and I'll start with Market Intelligence. For division reporting purposes, we have rebranded S&P Capital IQ and SNL as S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the first quarter, revenue increased 27%, primarily due to addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 81%, and the adjusted operating margin advanced 900 basis points to 30.3%.", "In 2016, successful integration of SNL is the top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL, and we recognize that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver a return on that investment.", "Our first quarter progress demonstrates our resolve to achieve these important targets. Most of the cost savings in the first quarter were the result of decreased staffing levels. Going forward, we will continue to target additional longer-lead-time synergies. Some of these items will require investment.", "Let me add a bit more color on first quarter revenue growth in the Market Intelligence business lines. In Financial Data & Analytics, S&P Capital IQ Desktop and enterprise solutions revenue increased 7%, principally through a high-single-digit increase in Desktop revenue. In addition, SNL revenue increased 13% compared to first quarter 2015, prior to our acquisition of SNL.", "Global Risk Services revenue increased 8%, led by double-digit RatingsXpress growth, which is increasingly used by customers to meet their regulatory reporting needs. In the smallest category, Research & Advisory, revenue decreased 9% due to declines in Equity Research services.", "Now, let me turn to Standard & Poor's Rating Services. During the quarter, revenue decreased 9%. The forex impact was negligible. Adjusted operating profit decreased 12%, and the adjusted operating margin decreased 160 basis points to 45.6%. The results were driven by a slow start to global issuance in the quarter. While January and February had anemic global issuance, however, market conditions improved late in the quarter, and March had the largest monthly debt issuance in the past year. Adjusted expenses declined 6%, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and legal expenses.", "Non-transaction revenue in the quarter increased to 3%, or 5% excluding forex, with strength in surveillance fees in CRISIL partially offset by declines in Rating Evaluation Service. Weak transaction revenue was caused by a 14% decline in global issuance, including a 64% decrease in global high-yield issuance, partially offset by mid-teens growth in bank loan ratings. The high-yield market has been particularly volatile with weak transaction volume since the third quarter last year.", "Let's take a look at issuance. U.S. issuance declined 24%, EMEA declined 10%, and the Americas ex-U.S. declined 27%. Only Asia reported an increase in issuance with an 8% gain. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year declining global issuance.", "If we look more closely at the largest markets, first quarter issuance in the U.S. was down across the board year-on-year. Investment-grade decreased 13%, high-yield down 61%, public finance was down 9%, and structured finance also declined 40%, with declines in every asset class.", "In Europe, investment-grade decreased 3%, high-yield was down 68%, while structured finance increased 7% with growth in covered bonds. And in Asia, investment-grade increased 10%, high-yield was down 39%, and structured finance increased 4% due to RMBS and covered bonds.", "During the quarter, Standard & Poor's Rating Services issued its annual global refinancing study. This yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming five years. This chart illustrates data from the 2015 and 2016 studies. The five-year period in the 2016 study shows a $600 billion increase in the total debt maturing versus the 2015 study. We use this study along with other market-based data to forecast and anticipate issuance.", "Taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high-yield maturities. Over the next five years, the level of high-yield debt maturing significantly increases each year, which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years.", "Yesterday, Standard & Poor's issued their latest global issuance forecast. We still expect overall global issuance in 2016 to finish slightly lower than the level seen in 2015, with a decline of about 2%.", "Interest rate assumption in the U.S. have been paired back, which should give a boost to speculative-grade issuers, though, through the remainder of the year. However, the decline of the previous three months is expected to weigh down global trends.", "Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, revenue increased 5%. Adjusted operating profit increased 5%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 67.7%.", "During the quarter, strength in revenue associated with exchange traded derivative activity and data licenses was partially offset by weakness in average ETF, AUM and OTC derivatives.", "If we turn to the key business drivers, market volatility, particularly early in the quarter, resulted in increased trading activity, the exchange-traded derivative. The average daily volume of exchange-traded derivative product based on S&P Dow Jones Indices increased 29%. Two key products, the E-mini S&P 500 Futures and the CBOE Volatility Index options and futures, known as the VIX, had volume increases of 29% and 43%, respectively.", "The exchange-traded product industry continues to show strength, recording inflows of $70 billion in the first quarter. Despite AUM based on S&P Dow Jones Indices reaching $828 billion at the quarter end, the highest since year-end 2014, average AUM during the quarter decreased 5% year-over-year. It's a testament to our business model and product scope that with the year-over-year declines in ETF average AUM, increased volatility has generated sufficient trading-related revenue to enable S&P Dow Jones Indices to deliver top line growth.", "On to Commodities & Commercial markets, organic revenue increased 8% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide and Petromedia acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit increased 21% and the adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 42.2%.", "Strength in Global Trading Services helped Platts deliver revenue growth of 10%. Clearly, the biggest news is the announcement that we've reached a definitive agreement to sell J.D. Power with an expected close in the third quarter. J.D. Power is an iconic brand and Fin O'Neill and his team have built a strong business over the past decade as part of McGraw Hill Financial. We wish Fin and all of the J.D. Power employees continued success.", "Turning to Platts, Global Trading Services booked double-digit revenue gains, primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE exchanges. This license revenue tends to be erratic from quarter-to-quarter based on trading activity.", "The core subscription business delivered high-single digit revenue growth led by the Petroleum sector which had mid-teens growth due to strength in market data for oil price assessment, shipping data and forward price curve product.", "Metals, Agriculture & Petrochemicals revenue grew mid-single digit, primarily to strength of the Singapore Exchange-listed TSI Iron Ore contract. Over the course of the year, we anticipate revenue growth will moderate as low oil prices have led to consolidations and restructuring in the oil and energy industry.", "On the business development front, we have great news. Mexico has entered into an exclusive agreement with Platts to utilize its oil and natural gas price data in the nation's pricing formulas as part of the energy reform policy. Mexico is one of the largest exporters of gas globally. It has vast resources of oil and gas and influences flow patterns not just in North America, but around the world.", "In closing, the breadth of our portfolio enabled the company to weather weaker \u2013 to weather market volatility and still deliver solid results. With the strength of our portfolio, we were off to a good start in 2016 and our adjusted diluted EPS guidance remains unchanged at $5 to $5.15. While we've made progress with the integration of SNL, it remains a top priority for the company with much more to do.", "The next time I speak with you, we will be named S&P Global with SPGI as our new ticker symbol, that's SPGI. We'll be ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday to mark the occasion.", "With that, I want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. And now, I'm going to hand it over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. First, I will recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings and outline a reporting change we made to bring greater clarity to the disclosure of our recurring revenue. Then, I will update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. In wrapping up, I will provide some color on our guidance.", "Let's start with the consolidated first quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you just heard from Doug, we are off to a good start in 2016 despite weak bond issuance, which resulted in a year-on-year revenue decline at S&P Rating Services. The balance of the portfolio, excluding Ratings, delivered strong 18% top line growth, driven by both organic growth and acquisition.", "Taken in total, reported revenue grew 5%. We have faced several quarters in a row of relatively weak global issuance and, once again, thanks to the strength and breadth of our portfolio, combined with the timely addition of SNL Financial, we were able to sustain top line growth.", "Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points, led by the outstanding profit growth and margin improvement and Market Intelligence. This division recorded an adjusted margin of 30%, an improvement of nine points versus a year ago. This was driven by strong top line growth, realized cost synergies and the addition of SNL profit. Looking forward, we anticipate Market Intelligence adjusted margins to generally continue in this new range.", "Adjusted margins across Commodities & Commercial also improved almost three points. Interest expense was up over $24 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year. This stepped up level of interest expense will continue to create a difficult year-over-year comparison until the fourth quarter.", "Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in over a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustained top line growth, margin improvement and share count reduction delivered an 8% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Now, let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled $15 million in the quarter. The first item consisted of a $24 million technology-related, non-cash impairment charge in Market Intelligence. This write-down is based on a change in strategy. The division was working towards sourcing certain data internally. Now, we have secured this data more economically from an outside source and are shutting down our internal capabilities.", "The second item is the net gain from insurance recoveries and the last item is primarily disposition-related costs incurred to sell J.D. Power. Also, as Chip pointed out earlier in the call, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release.", "In Exhibit 6 of today's press release tables, we have modified the way that we report recurring revenue to provide investors with more granularity in understanding our revenue mix. In the past, we reported ETF and mutual fund assets under management based licensing revenue in S&P Dow Jones Indices as non-subscription revenue. Because of the ongoing nature of this revenue, we are now classifying it as asset-linked fees. Admittedly, there is some volatility in assets under management, but the nature of this revenue stream is not as transaction oriented as bond issuance. With this modified classification, more than 70% of our revenue is largely recurring in nature.", "Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 90% was held outside the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $472 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a draw down on our credit facility. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will fluctuate as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs.", "Our first quarter free cash flow was $84 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements in related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first quarter free cash flow was $192 million. As a reminder, the first quarter free cash flow is seasonably weak due to the payment of annual incentives.", "Now, I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company bought approximately 2.2 million shares for $200 million. These purchases combined with our dividend totaled to approximately $296 million of cash returned to shareholders in the quarter. The share repurchase program remains an important component of the company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate leveraging share repurchases to help mitigate the dilution from our recently announced asset sales, subject to market conditions.", "Now, we'll provide some additional perspective on our 2016 guidance. At this time, we are leaving all of our 2016 guidance unchanged, and is summarized on this slide. This guidance continues to include the full year results of J.D. Power, S&P Securities Evaluation and Credit Market Analysis, all of which are pending sale. We will update guidance as necessary once these transactions are closed. While we will likely need to adjust our revenue guidance based on the timing of the divestiture of these assets, we anticipate using cash proceeds and ongoing share repurchase activity to mitigate the earnings per share dilution.", "So in summary, we are off to a good start in 2016. The strength of our portfolio with its high proportion of recurring revenue, combined with the continued progress on our cost reduction programs positions us well to manage through these volatile market conditions.", "So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for the Q&A session.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jack. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants I would kindly ask that you limit yourself to two questions; that's two questions, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session.", "Operator, we'll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. This question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. First question was just on the sale of the J.D. Power and the S&P Securities Evaluation and so forth. I'm surprised you guys didn't already exclude it. Is there any risk to the closing, or is this just a procedure decision? If you could give us some estimate of how much dilution that is before the buybacks?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "First of all, on the first part of your question, Manav \u2013 this is Jack, I don't think there's anything unusual about the closing conditions in these transactions. I suspect \u2013 I think \u2013 I do anticipate that perhaps J.D. Power may close a bit sooner. I would point to the middle or early third quarter. The sale of the pricing businesses maybe a little bit more late in the third, early fourth. That would be the timing that we're currently considering.", "In terms of the dilution for this year, for J.D. Power, if you assume a mid-year close, the EPS dilution is \u2013 it would probably be roughly $0.1. And at this point, I think our assumption we could use ongoing share repurchase activity combined with proceeds from sales to largely mitigate the dilution within the year. And again, I think because the other pricing businesses will be a bit more back-end loaded. I don't think it's going to be a big issue for \u2013 at this point in time, in terms of what we see for 2016.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the Ratings business, obviously, March window opened up and we'll see what happens there. But in terms of the expense control, can you talk about some of the initiatives you took this quarter to have that expense decline and what you can do for the rest of the year as well?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me start with that. First of all, during the quarter, we have continued with programs we've put in place for the last two or three years related to ensuring that we have the right effective approach to managing our expenses, staffing levels, et cetera. So during the quarter, we've continued to invest for the long run in the business. It's very important for us to continue to invest in technology to ensure that we're meeting all of the global regulatory requirements. But we, at the same time, have also been able to ensure that we have the right level of staffing for the level of transactions that are coming out. We have an opportunity to look at our accrual for our bonuses at the end of the year. In addition to that, if you remember last year in the first quarter, we were still in the final negotiations on settlements with the DOJ and the SEC. So we did not have that same level of legal expenses.", "Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about the selling environment for your Market Intelligence business, whether (26:29)? I know you put up some pretty strong growth for the Desktop business, but just what people are saying about the environment both for buying now and how you're thinking about renewals into next year?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, first of all, we've been looking very carefully at the broader set of demands and information requirements from our customers, going out to meet with banks, with buy side, sell side. In addition, digging deeper into different classes of people within those organizations, so portfolio managers, investment bankers, risk managers, CFOs, treasurers, et cetera. We generally see that there's a high demand for data across the financial institutions and increasingly as well as corporates. Corporates also are managing balance sheets and have more and more requirements for data and analytics.", "There are a lot of different tools which are available, and one of our goals is to ensure that the kinds of products and services that we provide, whether it's our ratings information that goes through our Risk Services business or, more importantly, the S&P Capital IQ and SNL products that are used in many different ways are tied and linked to the needs of the different constituencies that we're working with. So we've been forecasting there's a combination of volume growth that we're continuing to see in a positive sense, as well as pricing and different ways that we can increase our growth.", "Remember that when we bought SNL, one of the deal theses for us was that we're also going to be able to see more international growth for the SNL product. We're in the very early stages of that. We're seeing some pilots here and there that are starting to pay off, but it's part of our integration plan is to pursue the international aspect of SNL and very early days of that, but that's another component that we're driving for our growth.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. And then I would just say from a competitive standpoint, I know that it's always priced a little bit below some of your competitors and you've been looking to close that gap as you enhance the product. Could you maybe talk a little bit about where that initiative stands today and whether you expect that to continue to be a growth driver going forward? Or is it more just the number of desktops itself that should be driving growth?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's a combination of both, the desktops and penetration is very important for us. We want to have a commercial organization that is understanding the needs of our customers and targeting where we can place more services, whether it's desktops or it's overall enterprise-wide services. Pricing is something that obviously we look at across the board to see how we can always get better price realization. But for us it's more important, is to ensure that we have the right customer acceptance, and that's what's driving our growth principally.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "And just to clarify, there is no goal to close a gap, okay?", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "We want to price our products appropriately.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood. Thank you.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Alex Kramm from UBS. Sir, you may ask your question.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just coming back to the Ratings business for a little bit here. One of the things you've been talking about for a little bit, but not today, has been the work you've been doing on the frequent issuer programs. Some of those have been pretty outdated, and I think you're tweaking them a little bit. So just wondering if you could give a little bit more color and numbers around this in particular as we think about the next couple of years? How can that, I guess, repricing kind of add to the top line in that segment in terms of percentages?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "As I've mentioned on prior calls, the way we think about this is, we want to ensure that we have the appropriate commercial and sales organization in place in Ratings. We have \u2013 through the last few years, we've put in place all of the different requirements of Dodd-Frank and the CRA3 in Europe, which means that we've segregated our sales force and our commercial activities. Part of our commercial activities are to understand how we can best price for our customers. We can have yield for our ability to price for them for what they need in the services at the time. We have been looking at our frequent issuer programs. It is potentially a growth area for us, but it's not something that we're giving a lot of details on at this point in time.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Fair enough. And then, I guess moving to Jack, on the buybacks, $200 million this quarter, I mean, certainly bigger number than we saw a year ago, but in the context of a low share price, fairly soft I'd say. And in particular, if you think about J.D. Power and the businesses you sold to ICE and all the free cash flow you generate, I mean, you can easily buy back $1.5 billion, $2 billion this year. So should we expect a big pickup here? Or how are you thinking about the pace of buybacks as we look at the remainder of the year? And was there anything going on that prevented you from buying back, i.e., the J.D. Power sales and things like that?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think we were pretty in the market in the first quarter. It was a step up relative to the first quarter a year ago. And as we've alluded to in terms of our comments on guidance, it is our current assumption that from what we see right now, we'll largely use the cash proceeds from the asset sales to largely offset any dilution that we anticipate from the sale of what were profitable businesses. So to that end, as we do start to receive or in anticipation of cash received on sales, we do anticipate some pickup in our share repurchase activity, particularly more, I would say, in the back half of the year.", "Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Very good. Thanks.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Alex.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Sir, your line's now open.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. Just to go back to the Ratings business for a second. I was wondering, you gave your preliminary thoughts, I think, on the last earnings call about what your outlook for that business would be for 2016. Has that changed at all? I assume no because of guidance. And anything you could share on the margin front from a forecasting perspective would be helpful as well for 2016.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me give you \u2013 start by just a little bit of an outlook. We gave you a quick slide on that in our earnings slides we just gave you. We have looked at the forward approach to what we think 2016 issuance is going to be. When we did our last call, we said that we thought it'd be down about 1% for the year. We've adjusted that now, that it should be down about 2% for the year.", "In terms of components, industrials, or we want to call them non-financials, should be down about 6% to 10%. Financial services is one of the bright spots. There are a lot of needs for TLAC, or Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity for banks around the globe as well as some different programs, which is attracting financial services issuance. Structured finance is likely to be down 4% to 9%, and public finance in the U.S. is also going to be down 8% to 12%.", "International public finance will be up a little bit, 3% or 4%. But net-net, we expect that the total year issuance will be down about 2% to 2.3% for the entire year, and that's after a very, very weak first quarter as you know.", "We've seen in April so far issuance that stayed similar to the March, especially on investment grade. Investment grade has stayed quite strong. Non-investment grade issuance is still fairly weak into the second quarter. Throughout the year, we're going to continue to follow all of the same management disciplines we've talked about in the past, having to do with being \u2013 having a very aggressive commercial strategy, managing our costs in a way that are very prudent, while meeting all of our goals and objectives related to investments in technology and more efficiency in our business, as well as meeting all of our risk and compliance standards.", "As you see, we've kept our guidance at the same level despite having started off with a weak first quarter, because we believe that in addition to what we've seen across all of our businesses that we've got conditions to maintain that same level of guidance.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Got it. Okay. And then on the Market Intelligence business, obviously, we've seen a slowdown in IPOs and M&As start the year, and particularly capital markets. What portion of that business is exposed to that capital market slow down? And how do you offset or how do you think about the growth trajectory and the margins in that business for 2016 going forward?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think we've been talking about slowdown in capital markets now for a couple of years. So I don't know if we'd point to anything fundamentally has changed in the overall market environment for Market Intelligence. It is a competitive marketplace out there. But particularly now, as we now have the benefits of bringing together the scale benefits of SNL with our legacy S&P Cap IQ businesses, we think over time we'll have a much more compelling product offering, particularly as we move forward.", "On the margin question, obviously, we're very, very pleased with the step-up to approximately 30% margins in the business. I think that's generally the new range for the business for 2016. But I would think over the long-term, as we continue to realize synergies, which we are obviously making good progress on, but we continue to have a good number ahead of us, we think that there is some upside to the margin as we go into 2017 and beyond.", "Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Warren Gardiner of Evercore. Sir, you may ask your question.", "Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC", "Great, thanks. Good morning. So you guys mentioned structured products is down, I think, about 41% year-to-date and I think the guide, I think you just said, assumed about 4% to 9% decline for the year. So I was just kind of wondering where you see the most rebound coming from in terms of maybe product \u2013 specific to sort of product...", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So...", "Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC", "...through the balance of the year?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, couple of things. So first of all, there have been \u2013 we continue to see very strong covered bond market in Europe and in Asia. There's also what I would call bank originated securitization, which our traditional ABS products, its credit cards, its auto loans, things like that, those continue to be very strong. Banks are all actively managing their balance sheet to have the optimal level of capital. So those types of issuances, bank-specific, have been very, very busy, very important. The areas where we're seeing more, I guess, I'd use the word volatility in issuance, which means it's going up and down, is in traditional RMBS, which has been quite weak, as well as CMBS. We do see a robust pipeline of CMBS deals right now, but we didn't see that three weeks ago, six weeks ago and 12 weeks ago. So the CMBS market is a little bit more volatile, it's one of the swing factors.", "There has been some tightening of the spreads on CMBS deals in the United States over last couple of weeks. And we do think that we're seeing, because of that, we're getting a stronger pipeline. Anyway, so just to give you a view again, bank issuance, covered bonds, bank oriented securitizations, should be stronger, more steady, and then things like RMBS, CMBS around the globe, we're seeing more volatility in that. But we expect towards \u2013 our expectations on this forecast also take into account refinancing. And there are certain refinancing of securitizations as well, that are coming in through the second half of the year that we think will also come to the market.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We just updated our forecast which released yesterday, I mean, Chip, maybe after this call you can make the new forecast available so people can see on which our assumptions were based.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "And subscribers of Ratings Direct would already have it.", "Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC", "I've got to sign up then. Okay. So I guess just one more question there. So I guess you guys touched on it a little bit, but it hasn't quite been a year yet, but obviously when you announced the SNL deal, you highlighted Europe and Asia as kind of key areas, potential upside, or for revenue synergies. So I was wondering if you guys could just dig into that a little bit more and give us an update on some of the progress you've seen there so far?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't have any detailed numbers on that. What I'd tell you is that it's been \u2013 September is when we closed the transaction. So it's not quite a year yet. We have a very robust integration program which has 10 work streams. Those work streams include the classic areas you'd imagine, things like technology and ensuring that we have the right computer systems in place, et cetera.", "And there's a work stream on commercial opportunities where we have pilots across the globe. The team under Mike Chinn have done a fantastic job of identifying an optimal sales force, taking into account people from both of the businesses that know the markets really well. And we have pilot programs in Asia and in EMEA that we started launching. I think that it would be better if you gave us a few more months before we started thinking about what kind of disclosure and what kind of progress we would talk about on that.", "But just you didn't ask the question, but to talk a little bit about what that progress is, we mentioned in our remarks that a lot of that progress has been around initial cost reductions based on people leaving the organization and there's other synergies which will start coming through that have longer tails and maybe require some investments in areas like technology, operations.", "And then the top line, as we've said, will probably take a little bit longer overall. And when we gave our guidance in the last quarterly call, we updated it and we said that the revenue synergies, we're going to probably take a little bit longer, more along the original thesis that we had produced, which was around between now and 2019.", "Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Sir, you may now ask your question.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes, thanks. Maybe just following up on that last question, you mentioned \u2013 and digging into the Cap IQ \u2013 or, sorry, Market Intelligence margin improvement, it was people leaving the organization. Where are those people coming from? Was it data collection? Is it client service? I guess, more specifically, what did you become more efficient at than you were doing previously?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That was mainly from management. This is one of the biggest advantages of moving really fast on a decision about how to integrate businesses. And by making a decision to put Mike Chinn in charge of the division, within a week of the acquisition, we were able to move very quickly on the management structure. So that's principally where the roles came from.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. And then on the CNC segment, that the margins there, can you talk about what drove that? Was that J.D. Power, or is that Platts? And I know it's going to change once we sell J.D. Power, but is that level of margin sustainable, I guess?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's mostly Platts, and it's one of the nice things about having a business that grew almost 10% on the top line. So the very large percentage of that dropped to the margin and dropped to the bottom line.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I would just add, though, that there could be some fluctuation because we did have, as we mentioned, an unusually strong quarter in the Global Trading Services which is more transaction side of the business. So that's a nice growth business for us, but it was really high growth in the first quarter kind of given the volatility that was there. So I'm not sure that'll be there every quarter, but we're quite heartened by the progress. There was a bit of forex benefit to the margin improvement. So I'd say about a third of margin improvement was \u2013 we did get some forex benefit, but in general we think that we're \u2013 I think that's very solid right now.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Sir, you may ask your question.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning. So, Jack, I'm wondering if you could give us an update on how you're thinking about appropriate leverage ratios? And I think last quarter you said $500 million of buyback was in the guidance. Is that still how we should be thinking about it?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's a general range, Peter, in terms of base plan assumptions. I think that has to be \u2013 based on our current view, I think, going back to what we said earlier, I think we have to flex that upwards as we certainly get at least into the back half of the year given the proceeds from the asset sales that we see coming. And, obviously, we need to do something to reduce the dilution from the sale of those businesses. So we do anticipate some pickup at this point in time as we look to the back half of the year.", "And then, in terms of the leverage question, I think you've seen over the last year that we are methodically putting a little bit more debt into the balance sheet. We had two very successful bond raises last year. You've seen that we have used our short-term borrowing capabilities to flex \u2013 to continue to buy back relatively heavy in the Q1 timeframe, which is time that we're a little \u2013 we tend to be a little bit short U.S. cash. But we know we have that flexibility on using short-term debt to sustain the program. And we're going to \u2013 when we acknowledge that we still have more borrowing flexibility that we'll consider in terms of the pacing of future activities.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Got it. Thank you. And then on the \u2013 sticking with the SNL margins for a second, the performance is quite extraordinary relative to, I think, the expectations maybe you had initially laid out. And I think if I heard what Doug just said, you were indicating it was mainly due to sort of senior staff restructuring. So it's not a function yet of this change in the strategy about the \u2013 around the data sourcing? Is that correct? So there's still opportunity associated with that?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There's a couple of components of \u2013 this is a big \u2013 obviously, a big improvement in the margin. So it is \u2013 maybe it's important to comment on a couple important pieces here. One, if you look at just the performance of the legacy S&P Cap IQ business last year in 2015, the lowest margin point of the year was Q1. And the legacy S&P Cap IQ business did improve their margins to the mid-20% range when you looked into the second and third. So the run rate of the legacy Cap IQ business was getting better.", "Then you overlay the profits from the SNL acquisition, those two \u2013 those were significant and combined with both businesses growing very nicely on the top line. Then, you start to layer in the synergies. And the synergies, we had given guidance earlier that we thought about a third of the $100 million of total synergies would be achieved in 2016. And I can tell you we're very much on pace to deliver that based on what we've seen in the first quarter. So synergies did have a role in the expansion here, but it wasn't the only driver.", "And then, in terms of the nature of what we saw in the first quarter, it was more G&A related. And I think these longer term cost opportunities around data, technology, commercial, et cetera, are more down the line. So that's some of the work that we have ahead of us.", "Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. Sir, you may ask your question.", "Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC", "Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions. Understand that you guys have been working to change out your \u2013 improve your sales forces throughout the organization. I'd maybe like to get an update on that, how much further there is to go on that in terms of the management and just general upgrades and processes and all that. Thank you.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So first of all, we have a corporate-wide initiative to look at our overall data and analytics related to customers. This is something that we want to improve, we want to have the right kind of culture around the organization of understanding the importance of customers and customer data and analytics.", "In addition to that, we have a buy-in and approach for each of our businesses to hire new organizations or upgrade or promote people within the organization to have these commercial organizations that are focused on the markets. They're doing a new approach or an upgraded approach to market sizing, to market segmentation, et cetera. Each of the businesses now are very far along with those processes, although I'd say that we don't necessarily have all of the people in place. I do think it's part of our ongoing approach to growing the business. We think that top line growth is the best way to improve our margins and to improve the business overall and as well as having a portfolio now which has very scalable global businesses.", "So we are making a lot of progress in that area. We have very strong sales heads in Ratings, in our Indices business. We have a person named Will Pappas, who's leading the sales and commercial organization in Market Intelligence. And then, in Platts, we also have a new person who's just joining us to run that organization.", "Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then also can you just update us on your Ratings business? I mean, obviously the margins in Ratings were extremely high on an absolute basis. They do lag your main competitor out there. What's your updated thoughts in terms of what's left to do on the cost front, the margin front, moving margins more towards Moody's level? Understanding of course you're probably not ever going to get to their level maybe, but what's just sort of holding that back relative to your main peer out there? Thank you.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, as we've always said, and Chip just said before, we don't necessarily target our competitor in that sense. We want to ensure that we have the best business that we run that's compliant as well as providing excellent service to the markets. We have continued to invest in technology. If I were going to say there's any major area that we want to have at a very high quality level, it's going to be on technology. It's giving us the ability to have better work flow tools. It also gives us an opportunity to simplify the way we work and at the same time improve controls across the organization. So I think you'll see, over time, it's our goal and our target to have a steady progress on improvement in our margins, but also in a way that we run the business with the right kind of approach to customers and control.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And I would just add that I think what we saw in Q1, it's not just about cost management. I mean, revenue year-on-year was down over $50 million. So I think the organization did a very good job controlling their expenses overall as they worked through that moment of volatility.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Great. Thanks, Craig.", "Craig Anthony Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Sir, you may now ask your question.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So, first of all, congratulations on the sale of J.D. Power. And I wanted to ask my first question on Platts. And again we've had a \u2013 first quarter was a very volatile quarter for oil, sort of a blinding glance to the obvious, coming from the mid-30s to the mid-20s to the mid-40s. But I wanted to ask if you've seen any improvement now or change in another way in the selling environment there in terms of renewals and selling cycle, pricing?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Just a couple of headlines on that. In my remarks, I referenced that we have seen a difficult environment because there have been a lot of restructurings. There are a set of companies, which have defaulted or are going through restructurings. We expect over time there could be some challenges towards the end of the year on some of the renewals coming up. So we're very aware that we're not in an environment that's a robust high-growth, high-investment environment in the oil and petroleum industry overall.", "As Jack mentioned, one of the reasons that our earnings were so robust is because of our trading, our transactions services business in that area. So Platts has been a fantastic growth business for us. We like the business. We continue to invest in it aggressively. But we're also looking very cautiously at what kind of trends we're going to see in the industry overall.", "Just as an unrelated information, in the defaults, from the information from the Ratings business, there's been 67 defaults so far this year of which most of those \u2013 there were 16 of those were in the oil and gas industry, and there nine were from metals, mining and steel industry. So it's been a large number of those \u2013 the defaulters have been in that industry, something that we also watch carefully to see any kind of correlation across our businesses that we can use to pick up for our forecasting.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got you. And then just a clarification question on the S&P Dow Jones Indices recurring revenue. My understanding was you have benchmark data about 20% of that division, derivatives sales being about 25% and then the AUM being the remaining 55%. The AUM piece previously was treated as transaction; that's now going to be treated as recurring. The derivatives is going to remain as transaction, and the benchmark was recurring \u2013 is going to remain recurring. Is that the right way to look at that?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, it is right. The information, the benchmark side has always been classified in recurring revenue.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Right.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "The derivative trading remains in the transaction side because that can be very volatile. As we just looked at the revenue stream we have from assets under management, while there is some volatility there, it's not like it goes to zero. Like nothing ever \u2013 it's not as volatile...", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We hope, right?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That you ever see in bond issuance. So that's why we broke it out as a third category, because we do believe that it has different revenue characteristics and, in general, we think that's clearly more sticky than in the transaction side. So we think that gives investors a better sense to better appreciate the more recurring side of our future revenue flows.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And that's going to include the AUM associated with ETFs. That's going to include the AUM associated with mutual funds. And it also includes \u2013 we've got some steady contracts, if you will, that are associated with over-the-counter derivatives that are not based on volatility, if you will, but are set for a year, if you will, and that's very steady business...", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "...for the category as well.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "One more housekeeping item if I could. Is Platts going to be reported on a standalone basis going forward after the sale of J.D. Power, or is it going to be folded into another division?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Right now our current assumption is that Platts will be reported as a standalone entity.", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Excellent. All right. Well, thank you very much.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Bill, I want to just correct something. I said 67 defaults; there's actually 51 defaults so far this year. Sorry, just wanted to give you the right ...", "William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line's now open.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you so much. Just going back to the global Market Intelligence business, I know there's been some speculation of some potential de-bundling where folks maybe use cheaper or web-based products to gain certain aspects of their analysis. So the overall cost comes down. Are you seeing any of that or inklings of that at all in your business?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. So the notion that people want to buy from five different sources doesn't really make a lot of sense to us. What we really see exactly is opposite, is that purchasers like the simplicity of being able to purchase from as few vendors if possible. So, yeah, we don't see that.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "The only thing I would add, though, is I do think it puts \u2013 we were very mindful of some of the new \u2013 the competition that could be out there. I think it just raises the game in terms of ever better quality data and increasing analytic capabilities and the ability to link into a customer's work flow. So I mean, I think it just kind of \u2013 we have to kind of continue the journey we're on to maintain clear differentiation in the marketplace.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "All right. Great. And then just going back to the businesses that you plan to divest this year, you gave some color on the potential impact to EPS depending on the timing. How about the impact to revenues in EBITDA, either for this year or maybe with what those businesses contributed last year? Thanks.", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I don't want to jump into next year quite yet, but J.D. Power which will be at \u2013 let's just \u2013 if we assume it closes at mid-year, that could be approximately somewhere between about $175 million of revenue. And then on the pricing business, if we assume the end of third quarter close, that could be around $30 million. So that's \u2013 and taken in total, roughly $200 million if you assume the timing of close on both those transactions.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. And on the EBITDA or margin side?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I would say that between J.D. Power alone at mid-year is roughly $0.1. If you assume the third quarter close for the other business, you're probably talking about $0.13, $0.14 in total for the year.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "All right. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "That's prior to any share repurchase, correct?", "John F. Callahan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That would be prior to share repurchase, and that's going back to our earlier comments that our current anticipation is that we would leverage share repurchase activity to offset the dilution from these businesses. And we can tighten that up once we know the timing, both of the close of these transactions and the pacing of our share repurchase activities. But again, our current assumption is any adjustment we have in terms of our outlook for 2016 is going to be more around revenue, not EPS.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Denny Galindo of Morgan Stanley. Sir, you may now ask your question.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi there. I just had a quick question on Ratings. It seems like the maturities, especially in high-yield, are increasing as we look forward, but you mentioned that the Ratings Evaluation Services and kind of the determination (59:22) driver has been decreasing. So I was curious if this ECB announcement about purchasing corporate bonds is having any impact on either one of these? Maybe it's starting to drive Ratings Evaluation Services or maybe it's causing some of these upcoming maturities and high-yield to be pulled forward into this year, just any thoughts on that topic?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. On the first one \u2013 I'm going to answer the second part of your question first, the ECB. We've seen that the ECB's approach to being able to purchase very large portions of new bond issuance, we expect that that could have some positive impact on issuance. At the same time, there's \u2013 the ECB also have some liquidity programs it's providing to banks that make it actually attractive for them to keep assets on their balance sheet so there might be some increase in loan activity. We're not quite sure where all of these different initiatives are going to land, but we have seen corporate investment grade issuance in Europe. Even though it was weak, it seems to be picking up a little bit. So we expect there could be some pick up there.", "When it comes to Rating Evaluation Services, Rating Evaluation Services is more linked to activity of IPOs, companies that are going to be going to the market for the first time and want to have a benchmark or some sort of an ability to know how they rate. We also see Rating Evaluation Services that are done for M&A transactions.", "So what drives Rating Evaluation Services is not necessarily issuance, it's much more related to IPOs, to M&A activity. Those are the links that are more important on that. And as you know, during the quarter, both IPOs and M&A, there were some big M&A headline deals, but there was not as much smaller M&A deals. And in addition to that, the IPO activity was very, very weak. So some of those correlation factors were weak. So we watch RES, it's a business for us that we actually use sometimes as a leading indicator for M&A activity itself.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, another one on Ratings. Can you talk a little bit more in detail about the CMBS market? You kind of mentioned it as being down, but it's been very volatile. You've been out of that market in the conduit side for a while, but you've recently reentered. And I was wondering if you can give us any color about how market share in the quarter has tracked or how quickly it's back to gain some traction in that CMBS market?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We're back in the CMBS market. We're working with the marketplace. We have not done any issuance so far, we have not rated any deals, but we are working closely to understand the dynamics of that marketplace and get our name back out there.", "Denny L. Galindo - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Sir, you may now ask your question.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Hi. Good morning. So can you disclose what the revenues were for the four buckets of Market Intelligence, please?", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "To be absolute, what we give you the \u2013 on the slide that we give you, we give you the change year-over-year for the various buckets. We don't provide the absolute number within that.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We did disclose the SNL revenue numbers specifically.", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Okay, thanks. But I mean, the \u2013 yeah, so we just currently don't do that. I can generally size it for you, if you'd like, but we don't give the exact numbers.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Okay. And, just lastly, on the two businesses you're selling to ICE, just a little bit more color there. Why is it closing later in 3Q or 4Q and what can you tell us about the revenue growth profile of that business historically?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "First of all, I mean, let's take a step back, why are we selling those businesses? They're nice sticky businesses. They are not \u2013 I wouldn't classify it as high growth, but I would say solid growth, very sticky, good margins. But at the end of the day, they are not something that was a core focus in terms of investment, in terms of growth. So given their size, we thought it was prudent to really focus Market Intelligence going forward, particularly with the SNL transaction. But there was \u2013 we had more than enough things to work on where we had larger, more strategic scale positions. So that was sort of the logic of it. They are \u2013 in total, on an annualized basis, they're roughly $100 million in revenue. So that's why in terms of the \u2013 depending on the timing of the close, we'll see what the impact is to 2016. And we're just working through the final closing conditions and regulatory approvals and that's why we do anticipate a close with it later in the year.", "Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Gary Wei of Susquehanna Financial Group. Sir, you may now ask your question.", "Gary Wei - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)", "Good morning. Thank you. Can you just remind us about where are we in terms of the cost reduction program right now?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Are you talking about the $140 million cost reduction program?", "Gary Wei - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)", "Yes, yes.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think we're largely on pace right now as we enter 2016 \u2013 (01:04:58) on the original assumptions of achieving on the $140 million cost reduction program that we anticipate to achieve by the end of 2016. I would then, though, need to overlay because that's the subsequent to the announcement of that target back in early 2014 is then subsequently on top of that. We have the incremental cost synergy target of the SNL transaction, which we anticipate to achieve by the end of 2016 also. So that synergy target is $100 million, a third of which to be achieved in 2016. So you call that $35 million \u2013 that'd be $35 million on top of the $140 million that we think we'll achieve by the end of 2016, so $175 million in total.", "Gary Wei - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)", "Okay, great. Thank you. So if we \u2013 now thinking about the SNL, just thinking about the program that you already had in place, after you finish this, should we expect that we'll be \u2013 we'll continue to work on a new program to have some further cost reduction?", "Robert S. Merritt - Vice President, Investor Relations", "So the question is after we're done with all these programs, will there be other cost reduction programs?", "Gary Wei - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)", "Right, right. Thanks.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That is a key question on which we are asking ourselves as we go into our \u2013 as our three-year strategic planning. But, yeah, I think it's fair to say companies always have some ongoing productivity activities.", "Gary Wei - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we will now take our final question from Doug Arthur from Huber Research. You may now ask your question.", "Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC", "Yeah. Just specifically on the $24 million technology impairment charge in Market Intelligence, I mean, as the SNL team gets deeper into the process, should we expect to see more of these kind of charges and related benefits as the year unfolds?", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Not of this nature, I don't think, Doug. I think it \u2013 we didn't have any restructuring charges in the quarter. Going forward, I think, there's likely to be some restructuring activity from time-to-time. I would say this issue is a little bit more specific, and the reason why the number was as high as it was, part of it, about half of it, kind of relates to an acquisition that was done several years ago. So part of that technology and tangible was put up at the time of the acquisition, and the other half related to ongoing software development since that point.", "And so that's why it was a little bit larger than normal for us. But I don't \u2013 at this point in time, I don't anticipate an ongoing stream of these sort of \u2013 we don't capitalize that much as it relates to software development in general. So I think the magnitude here, it will be fairly modest as we look forward.", "Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Doug, any more questions from you?", "Douglas Middleton Arthur - Huber Research Partners LLC", "No, I'm good. Thank you.", "Doug L. Peterson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Great. Okay, thank you, everyone. We appreciate that all of you joined the call. We are pleased that we were able to start the year with a very solid quarter, especially with the progress on the integration with SNL, and we're also very excited about being able to launch the company as S&P Global starting on Thursday morning.", "So thank you again for your support, and we look forward to talking to you again soon.

Doug?", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you, Chip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. This morning Jack and I will review our second quarter results. We're very pleased with the progress the company is making creating growth in a macroeconomic environment has challenged many of our customers.", "Let me begin with the highlights of the second quarter. Every segment delivered revenue growth, this is a testament to the quality of our products and the creativity and execution of the employee to develop and deliver them. In addition to creating growth, driving performance is a key thing in managing the company and margin improvement is an important yardstick by which our progress is measured. This quarter the company delivered 210 basis points expansion in the adjusted operating profit margin. The top priority for 2016 is the integration of SNL. We continue to make progress on SNL integrations and synergy targets, and I'll share few examples with you in a few moments.", "Financial performance was excellent with an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 17% over the most difficult quarter comparison in 2015. As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding debt by 3% year-over-year. Last week, we received final regulatory approvals for the sale of J.D. Power. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $513 million, and we increased the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range reflecting strong second quarter results.", "Before I get to the results in more detail, I want to take a moment to discuss the British exit from the European Union. First and foremost, Brexit has no immediate implications for European operations, it's business as usual for S&P Global. While the media has reported that a number of companies plan on moving operations out of London, we have no such plans. We expect that because of the uncertainty it creates, however, Brexit could hamper issuance, particularly in Europe. So far the impact has been muted but markets never like uncertainty; it will take time to resolve all of the various regulatory changes that companies and markets will face.", "Our company will seek to work with a relevant UK and EU legal and regulatory authorities to navigate the path forward, a process that will likely take years. S&P Global Ratings has written extensively on the impact that Brexit will have on the markets and our views can be found on the S&P Global Ratings website at the URL listed on this slide.", "Now, let's take a closer look at the second quarter results. While reported revenue grew 10%, organic revenue on a constant currency basis increased 5%. In most recent quarters, the Company's revenue has been hit by Forex with little impact to operating profit, primarily due to the weak British pound however, this quarter was different. In the second quarter Forex had a negligible impact on the revenue, yet contributed approximately three percentage points to adjusted operating profit and approximately 100 basis points for the adjusted operating profit margin. Most of this benefit was realized in S&P Global Ratings.", "So overall, the company delivered 210 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin improvement as a result of forex, S&P Global Ratings margin improvement, and the progress made on SNL integration synergy targets. Together revenue growth, margin improvement and share repurchases combined led to 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. In the second quarter, every division recorded top line growth and improvement in adjusted operating profit. The two standout performers were S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 400 basis points and 370 basis points respectively.", "Now let me turn to the business and I'll start with S&P Global Ratings. During the quarter revenue increased 4% with a negligible impact from Forex. Adjusted operating profit increased 12% and the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 54.1%. Improved market conditions after a weak 2016 start resulted in a modest year-over-year issuance increase. For the first time in six quarters, international revenue outperformed domestic. Forex had a favorable impact as 3 percentage points in adjusted operating profit and approximately 150 basis points on the adjusted operating margin, due primarily to the weakness in the British pound. Excluding Forex, adjusted expenses decreased 3 percentage points, mainly due to reduced outside services.", "Another highlight of the quarter was the purchase of 49% stake in TRIS Rating. This increased commitment to TRIS and an exciting step forward in our longstanding relationship. By working together more closely, we'll be in a better position to serve our customers and investors in Thailand and other Asian markets.", "Non-transaction revenue increased 3% from growth in surveillance, CRISIL, commercial paper activity and royalties from the services. Transaction revenue increased 5% as a result of improved contract terms, increased bank loan rating, and growth in debt issuance in Asia. If we look more closely at the largest markets, second quarter issuance in U.S. was down 11% with investment grade decreasing 6%, high yield down 9%, public finance up 4%, and structured finance declining 37% with drops in every class. In Europe, investment grade is unchanged, high yield is down 5%, while structured finance increased 4% with strength in RMBS and CLL [ph]. And in Asia, investment grade issuance surged 60% and structured finance increased 20% due to ABS and RMBS.", "Let's take a further look at issuance. The 3% increase in global issuance break the four quarter streak of year-on-year decline in global issuance that had pressured S&P Global Ratings revenue. During the quarter only Asia reported an increase in issuance with a 55% gain. Excluding domestic Chinese issuance which we don't rate, issuance in Asia still increased 35%. One factor driving this was offshore Chinese issuance. During the quarter investment grade was generally had unlimited access to debt capital markets while spec-grade issuers had very limited access with windows of opportunity that opened for short periods and then were disrupted by external events.", "Despite the year-over-year declines in the U.S. and Europe, there were periods of extreme strength during the quarter, in fact May set a monthly record for U.S. investment grade issuance. June started out with a very strong issuance but then came to standstill in the week leading upto the Brexit vote. Last week S&P Global Ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. We now expect global issuance to decline 3.8% in 2016. This compares to the April forecast which anticipated decline of approximately 2%. The biggest difference is only corporate and structured issuance which had been lower due to Brexit and international public issuance which is an increase as first half issuance already exceeds all of 2015.", "Now let S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the second quarter revenue increased 29%, primarily due to addition of SNL. Excluding SNL revenue, organic growth was 8%. Adjusted operating profit increased 48%, and the adjusted operating margin advanced 370 basis points to 28.4%. The adjusted segment operating margin includes the benefit from Forex of approximately 100 basis points. Excluding Forex, this figure is comparable to the first quarter adjusted segment operating margin. We had a favorable impact of 5 percentage points on adjusted operating profit, primarily due to weakness in the Indian rupee and British pound.", "In 2016, successful integration of SNL is the top priority for the company. We made a substantial investment with the acquisition of SNL, and we recognize that we must achieve our integration synergy targets in order to deliver a return on that investment. We are well on our way to achieving cross-sell synergy targets from 2016. Last quarter we reviewed some of the organizational changes that took place. Today in order to help you get a better sense of our efforts, I'm going to share several examples of integration synergies progressed during the quarter.", "We reconfigure our risk services scorecard product for analyzing commercial banks to include SNL bank data. We received great feedback and early sales success from the market. We integrated our equity ownership and earnings estimate data onto the SNL platform. We made tremendous progress on these trading SNL sector-specific fundamental data into our Xpressfeed delivery platform. Now in beta testing, SNL content will be available this fall enabling more seamless cross-selling to our existing feed clients. We completed significant design work on our next generation consolidated product platform to encompass mobile, web and excel delivery. Reduced cost by replacing third-party data with internal solutions, we completed our office consolidations in Denver, New York and Singapore with other cities still in the works. We've been making great progress.", "Let me add a bit more color on second quarter revenue growth in S&P Global Market Intelligence which delivered double-digit user growth in both S&P Capital IQ desktop and SNL. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ desktop and enterprise solutions revenue increased 8% with high single-digit growth in both products. In addition, SNL revenue reported a 9% increase compared to the second quarter 2015. Prior to our acquisition of SNL however, excluding a purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, revenue grew 10%. With that progress that we continue to make integrating SNL into S&P Global Market Intelligence will become increasingly difficult to separate SNL results from the total. Therefore this is likely the last quarter we'll provide separate revenue figures for SNL.", "With services revenue increased 10% led by double-digit Ratings Xpress growth. In the smallest category, research and advisory, revenue decreased 12% due to declines in equity research services.", "Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices; revenue increased 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4%, and adjusted operating margin improved slightly to 66%. Market volatility has created large swings in AUM from months to months as well as volatility in the number of exchange for a derivative contract traded each month. During the second quarter, revenue increased primarily due to steady data license growth, strength in exchange traded derivative activity due to market volatility, and ETF related revenue is up slightly.", "If we turn to three types of revenue; transactional revenue from exchange traded derivatives increased primarily to 24% increase in average daily volume of products based on S&P DJI's Indices. In particularly, E-mini S&P 500 Futures, CBOE Volatility Index, VIX, and CME Equity complex contracts, all increased more than 20%. Asset linked fees revenue, mostly from exchange rated funds was up slightly. The exchange credit product industry recorded further $46 billion in the second quarter with fixed income products receiving the largest inflows. Average AUM associated with our indices increased 3% year-over-year with inflows of 7% offset by asset value declines of 4%.", "The quarter ended on a high note recording an ETF, AUM associated with our indices reaching a new record of $855 billion as U.S. equity markets rebounded. This creates a great starting point for the third quarter. Subscription revenue which consists primarily of data subscriptions and customer indices increased due to continued steady growth in data subscription revenues.", "During the quarter the Company launched 90 new indices and our partners launched new ETFs based on our indices. We added two in the environment social government space that I'd like to highlight. JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index is designed to measure performance of Japanese companies that are proactively and effectively making investments in physical and human capital based on various metrics including the RobecoSAM Human Capital scores. In the S&P ESG Index Series, designed to measure the performance of companies with a rating scale based on an ESG factor score derived from RobecoSAM's annual corporate sustainability assessments. This launch brings together for the first time smart data and sustainability into a global index family that treats environmental social governance of ESG on a standalone performance factors. With the addition of these two indices we now have 130 ESG indices.", "This quarter we celebrated the 120th anniversary of the Dow Jones Industrial Average launched in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones. On its first day, May 16, 1896, the Dow closed at 40.94. Today the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the iconic symbol of the U.S. stock markets.", "Now onto S&P Global Platts which currently includes J.D. Power. Organic revenue increased 4% adjusted for the NADA Used Car Guide, Petromedia, and RigData, acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit increased 7% and adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 38.4%. Platts delivered 7% revenue growth driven by strength in subscriptions in the global trading services. J.D. Power had a decline in organic revenue due to lower consulting revenue in China. With all of the regulatory requirements completed, we continue to expect closing sale of J.D. Power this quarter.", "Turning to Platts, global trading services led the growth during the quarter with double-digit revenue gains primarily due to the timing of license fees and strong license revenue from the Singapore and ICE Exchanges. The core subscription business delivered mid-single digit revenue growth led by the Petroleum sector with particular strength in Asia. Metals, Agriculture & Petrochemicals revenue grew at high-single digit, primarily due to the strength in Singapore Exchange-listed PSI iron ore contracts and metal market data subscriptions. While rig counts are up since the beginning of May, many of our customers remained under pressure from low oil prices; therefore we continue to expect growth from moderate slightly in the remainder of 2016 as these customers continue to face difficulty.", "Finally, the CME Group that reduced the new Aluminum A380 Alloy, our futures contract that settles against our price assessment, there has been growing need for North American aluminum alloy risk management tool. This contract will provide market participants with an effective solution for hedging aluminum alloy price risk. On the business development front, we have several new items; a June reacquired RigData, a leading provider of daily information on rig activity for the natural gas and oil markets across North America. We've discussed our desire to add our own supply demand data offerings, and this extends our energy analytic capabilities in North America natural gas with oil offerings.", "Founded in 1986, RigData provides over 5,500 cost to customers with daily electronic reports on drilling permits, activity and rig locations in United States, Gulf of Mexico and Canada. We launched five domestic oil product assessments in Japan. Platts now assesses prices for important refined oil products for domestic waterborne deliveries in Japan from locations in Tokyo Bay, Chikyo [ph]. These waterborne assessments reflect prices for gasoline gas oil kerosene, low for fuel oil and high fuel oil. These assessments will follow Platts market on closed principal.", "And finally we launched the LNG U.S. Gulf Coast marker. The natural gas infrastructure that connects the United States, Mexico and Canada is the world's largest and most integrated natural gas market. By 2020, the Americas are expected to be the world's third largest producer of LNG behind Australia and Qatar. This new price reflects the daily export value as LNG traded free onboard from the U.S. Gulf Coast.", "In summary, all segments delivered revenue growth. Bond issuance recovered from a weak start to the year, margin improvement continues to be a key focus. Integration of SNL remains a top priority for the company's meaningful progress to-date. We expect Brexit to have no immediate implication through the Company. And we are increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $5.05 to $5.20. Our guidance has been updated to now include dilution from the pending sale of J.D. Power.", "With that I want to thank you all for joining the call this morning. But before I turn the call over to Jack Callahan, our Chief Financial Officer, I wanted to say a few words about him. As you know, Jack has accepted new position at Yale, not only is he an active Yale Alumni, he grew up at New Haven, Connecticut, so Jack's going home. We're thankful for the time he spent with us after joining the company in November 2010 he is instrumental in engineering the transformation to S&P Global, a faster growing, more focused and profitable company. He also assembled an outstanding organization and we're grateful for all he has done for the company's shareholders. Early next month, Jack will begin his role of Senior Vice President of Operations at Yale. We wish Jack and his family all the best.", "Rob Mackay, our current Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO as we continue the search process for Jack's replacement. Thank you, Jack, and now I'll turn the call over to you.", "John Callahan", "Thanks, Doug, and I appreciate those kind words, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I will recap key financial results. I also want to discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings. Then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow and return of capital. In wrapping up, I will provide some color on our updated guidance. Let's start with the consolidated second quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items I want to highlight. As you have just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top line growth. Collectively, that led to an increase in reported revenue of 10% with organic growth up 5%, the difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition.", "Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points, approximately 100 basis points was due to Forex. The balance is primarily due to outstanding profit growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence, both businesses have delivered margin improvements year-to-date. Interest expense was up over $26 million due to our highly successful bond offerings last year, partially in support of the SNL acquisition. This steps up the level of interest expense, will continue to create a difficult year-over-year comparison until the fourth quarter. Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in more than a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. So overall, sustained top line growth, margin improvement and share account reductions delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the most profitable quarter in 2015.", "Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $22 million in the quarter. The first item is a net gain from insurance recoveries. The second item includes net disposition costs primarily related to the pending sale of J.D. Power to the XIO Group, and our CMA pricing business to ICE. The last item is the restructuring charge in S&P Global Ratings as business continues to focus on sustained productivity. Again, as we discussed last quarter, our adjusted results now exclude deal related amortization of $23 million. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release.", "Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 95% was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.5 billion of long-term debt and $309 million of short-term debt in commercial paper and from a draw down on our credit facility. Since the end of the first quarter, we have reduced short-term debt by $163 million. Going forward, our level of short-term debt will likely fluctuate a bit as we periodically tap into the short-term debt market to fund our share repurchase program and meet other corporate needs.", "Our first half free cash flow was $478 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, first half free cash flow was $513 million and is on-track to reach our 2016 guidance of approximately $1.3 billion.", "Now I want to review our return of capital. During the quarter, the company bought approximately 1.4 million shares. These purchases combined with our dividend totaled to approximately $242 million of cash returned to shareholders just in this quarter. Year-to-date, the Company has returned $538 million to shareholders. The volume weighted average price that shares repurchased so far this year is approximately $98. The share repurchases program remains an important component of the Company's overall capital allocation. In addition, we anticipate stepping up share repurchases to help mitigate some of the dilution from the pending sales of J.D. Power subject to market conditions.", "Now let me provide some additional perspective on our 2016 guidance. There are three items that have been updated. Our previous guidance included the results of J.D. Power for the full year. We now assume that the sale of J.D. Power will be completed during the third quarter and have removed J.D. Power results for the balance of the year. This will have an impact on revenue, and our guidance moves from mid to high single digits to new guidance of mid-single digit growth. Year-to-date margins has benefited by approximately 100 basis points from Forex. Therefore we have increased our adjusted operating profit margin improvement from approximately 50 basis points to a new guidance of approximately 150 basis points.", "Despite the inherent dilution from removing several months of J.D. Power results, we are increasing our 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 due to the strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. The new range is $5.05 to $5.20. We are keeping a wide range as there remains considerable macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact the markets and our customers.", "So in summary, the second quarter was a strong quarter for the company. Each of our segments is performing well, and we are well positioned to continue to provide the essential benchmarks in data and analytics that our customers require.", "As Doug mentioned earlier, today is my last earnings conference call. It has been a pleasure and an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer of initially the McGraw Hill Company, the McGraw Hill Financial, and now S&P Global. I want to thank our shareholders and the analyst community for your interest and support as we have transformed the company. And finally, I want to thank you over 20,000 S&P Global associates for your hard work and commitment in building a stronger organization for the future. I wish you all well and I remain optimistic on the continued success of S&P Global going forward.", "With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.", "Robert Merritt", "Thanks, Jack, just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. I would kindly ask that you limit yourself to two questions; that's two questions each, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. This question comes from Ashish Rao, Credit Suisse. You may now ask your question.", "Ashish Rao", "Good morning. I guess first question just on market intelligence. Can you please give us an update on the selling environment, I was particularly curious on how efforts to broaden SNL's geographic presence into Europe? And also how pricing consolidation are going so far as you integrate SNL and Capital IQ?", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you and welcome. Welcome to the call, I think this is your first time on our call. And so first of all, the market intelligence business is advancing quite well as you heard from some of the statistics that I provided and some of the examples. Related specifically to your question about selling environment, I'll just be clear that we continue to progress faster on cost synergies than we do on sale synergies. But we are finding some early wins -- we're finding more wins in Asia right now that we are necessarily in Europe. I mean this is where we're able to either sell SNL products into Asia customers who are using the former Cap IQ salesforce. Or we're funding opportunities where we've integrated the services together between Cap IQ and SNL and also delivering them into Asia.", "The selling environment is mixed as you know, there still are a lot of financial institutions that is one large part of our customer interface that are reducing headcount, they are reducing some of their -- specifically, trading and front office people. On the other hand on the back office and areas like compliance, controlled risk management, and also some more traditional consumer banking and commercial banking activities, there continue to be increase in headcount. So the environment is mixed with some consolidation and shrinking happening, and on the other hand increase in demand for risk management, for other sorts of tool. So we're seeing a mixed market but we are continuing to have a very, very strong sales effort. Our sales team has integrated excellent in a big way that's very well integrated, and they've got a new commercial approach like reaching out to clients in a much more consolidated organized way, and we're starting to see a top line growth coming out of the synergies as well.", "Ashish Rao", "Great. And maybe a question for Jack, on the pending sale of the pricing business; so I'm curious if you could give us the EPS contribution this quarter and also any sense of the timeline for the sale?", "John Callahan", "In terms of its contribution, it's a couple of pennies per quarter. We're still waiting on the final approvals to close that transaction. Our current assumption is that we've looked for a close towards the end of the year. Our current estimate assumes -- sometime in the fourth quarter, and so we believe the net dilution impact within 2016 is going to be quite minimum.", "Ashish Rao", "Okay, thank you. These were my questions. And Jack, I wish you well.", "John Callahan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm, UBS. Your line is open.", "Alex Kramm", "Good morning, everyone. First of all, let me echo what Doug said, thanks for all the help Jack over the years and obviously all the best for the new endeavors. With that, maybe on the ratings business, I'm not sure how easy this is to enter but as you know, your primary competitor is already reported a few days ago and what certainly stood out as your much awaited growth year-over-year, and particularly on the transactional side. So from what you can tell would be helpful as you could maybe decide for where you might be winning; what businesses you might have done a little bit better or what the mix contributed to that for the outperformance?", "Doug Peterson", "This is Doug, thanks for the comments. And to start off with -- as you know, we've been engaging in a commercial approach to running our business with hiring of Krik Hoise [ph] for the last year to lead our commercial activities. We've approached our clients in a way that gives us a broad relationship oriented approach where we're looking at ways to broaden our coverage, including products like loans, ratings, RES etcetera. So we're looking across that as well as looking at our contract terms. One of the areas where we also had very strong in this quarter was in Asia. Just to give you a color on the issuance in Asia, it was up in across the board in every category. In fact, total issuance in Asia this quarter was greater than total issuance in United States if you include sovereign issuers; sovereign issuers are not necessarily an area that there is a lot of profitability on but even so the total issuance in Asia for the first time outgrew the total issuance in the U.S.", "In the U.S. as you know, the issuance was down overall, in corporate 7%, financial institutions is down, while in Asia the corporates who have 32% and financial institutions were up 84%. So it was a combination of our sales approach, our relationship management approach, more penetration and looking at how we're working on contracts and then very importantly, the volume in Asia.", "Alex Kramm", "Great. And then maybe just for Jack on the GMI margin; and hopefully my numbers are correct here but it looks like the margin actually came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I think last quarter you had said expect kind of like a flattish for the remainder of the year. I noticed it can be bouncing around but just given that you've taken cost out and I think folks are hoping for that margin to actually go higher. Just maybe some commentary of what do you expect for the remainder of the year and whether maybe it was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter despite the benefit? Thanks.", "John Callahan", "I'll only give a little bit more detail as Doug added some comments on it earlier. The primary difference between the first and second quarter is the Forex benefit, there was just relatively more Forex benefit in Q1 than it was in Q2. So there was about two points benefit in Q1 and less than one in this quarter. So once you equalize for that you're pretty much in that same range around 28%. And we're quite pleased with that step versus the year ago and reducing this is an opportunity we can continue to get some steady improvement overtime.", "Alex Kramm", "Very good, thanks.", "John Callahan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Manav Patnaik", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen, and firstly, congratulations Jack as well as thank you for your help. My first question on the Ratings business, if you could just elaborate on -- I guess you had in your press release and you just mentioned in terms of the commentary around improved contract terms. Can you just help understand if there is -- some of those pricing initiatives you guys have talked about or we've been talking about the last year or so or what basically are you referring with that language?", "Doug Peterson", "That language refers to the types of engagements that we have with our customers. We have many, many different pricing approaches across the globe where one of the biggest things you're going to hear from us, from our ratings business over and over this term simplify, we have projects to simplify our workflow, we've been investing in technology simplifier workflow that also brings with a combination of better control, better process management; and then also in many cases lower expenses. So on that side we're having a lot of focus and on the top line we're also looking at ways to simplify our pricing model to revisit our contracts that we've had with customers for very long time that provided relationship pricing that we want to recalibrate to markets so there is much larger issuance. So it's a combination of factors but the top line growth, some of that has been driven by approach to how we look at our pricing and even though we're simplifying it, it has had some benefits and also going up.", "Manav Patnaik", "Got it. And then just -- bigger picture, obviously a lot of things are going good for the Company and you've done a lot of tuck-ins here; just thinking about the appetite for M&A going forward, obviously there seemed to be some assets up for sale in the sea side of things in fixed income. So just curious on how we could think about your plans in that area?", "Doug Peterson", "I guess what I'd say -- first of all, our number one and number two priorities are; number one is to continue with the integration of SNL, that is something that's critical for us; as you know, we've made a very large investment in that. And even though we've had -- we're off to a great start it doesn't mean we're going to take our eye off the ball on that one. And number two is to smoothly complete the exit of J.D. Power which has been going well but we want to make sure that we complete in a way that's very organized and executed well everything we started. Putting those two aside though, you mentioned tuck-ins there, we continue to look at opportunities, we're not going to shut things out but if we believe that there would be opportunities that might have incremental value to our Company by adding capabilities or products or sales or operations or geographies that might enhance our ability to create value, we might look at those but we're always going to look at those in combination with what the financial returns are and how that looks for the long run. And then also do we have the capacity and management skills and capabilities to absorb and take over those businesses. So we have our eyes open, and you know our normal philosophy about our capital waterfall, and so we do look at things but nothing to report on.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Toni Kaplan", "Good morning. You mentioned that SNL grew about 10% in the quarter while I think last year it might have been closer to about 13%. So anything to call out there and are you still looking for low to mid-teens for that business, longer term?", "Doug Peterson", "Let me start and see if Jack has anything to add. We're still looking for long term, we have looked at this business, it's a very attractive growth machine for us. We expect that over the long run it's going to be growing in low double-digit range, it's something we're looking for. This last quarter there were combination of factors that potentially growth came down a little bit, again, it has to do with the overall financial institutions market with some of the downsizing that firms had done inside of the organization. And we're looking continue to see how we can drive that growth and the main factor over the last quarter just related to the slowdown in some of the headcount and financial institutions.", "Toni Kaplan", "Okay, great. And then in Platts, it looked like revenue grew nicely but margins declined a little bit year-over-year. Is that just a result of mix or what caused that and can you assure money of any initiatives you might have going on in terms of Platts margin extension?", "Doug Peterson", "I think the impact on the margins in the quarter was largely driven by more J.D. Power than Platts, it's from some expense timing at J.D. Power. So that was actually a bigger driver than anything really at Platts. And in couple of quarters J.D. Power will be out in numbers and it will be -- we'll have a clear view of the quarter-to-quarter performance in Platts.", "Toni Kaplan", "Got it, thanks a lot. Good luck, Jack.", "John Callahan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. You may ask your question.", "Craig Huber", "Good morning. Congratulations as well Jack, and thanks for all your help. Let's talk margins if we could on the market intelligence area here. With margins in the very high 20s right now including SNL, when you guys think out long-term here -- I mean do you think it's possible to get these margins inside the high 30s including SNL, long-term, since the market holds together?", "Doug Peterson", "Craig, I think from a longer term point of view, from the benchmarking we've done relative to other similar companies, I think I'll be reluctant to put out a target of high 30s. I do think though with growth, with scale, with realization of incremental synergies that has been identified for 2017 and 2018, we do see a path to margin extension but I think from a longer term point of view, we'd more in sort of a mid-30's range versus a high 30s.", "Craig Huber", "Okay. And then also on the Ratings business -- you did a great job on Platts again in the first half, down to 5% or so. Despite FX, what's driving that -- in-house sustainable or cost efforts you guys are doing?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes, there is a couple of things driving it in addition to FX. One of them is, if you recall about year and a half ago, we had undertaken a couple of programs to rebalance our sales force, as well as rebalance our analytical force globally. We also had some programs where we slowed down some hiring, so some of that's just coming through from straight headcount and straight changes to the way that we are managing the business, so those continue to go through. But one of the major areas, if you recall last year in the first half of the year we had the final resolution of some of the disputes and losses we had the U.S. government in 20 states, as well as some private litigation. There had been some residual expenses related to that and then we also have been engaged in the full blown implementation of the Dodd-Frank rules which kicked-in in June 2015. And in order to implement that we had engaged some outside help from some consultant firms and risk management experts, etcetera.", "So those are the legal fees related to -- those have tapered off in the second quarter, and then some of those external consulting fees and other advisory fees, those are gone. And so we think that we're approaching a more sustainable level of expenses going forward, although I would point out that with some of our programs we do continue to invest in technology, that's critical for us. And as we simplify the business, we will be investing technology; and here and there we are going to invest in talented people so -- but we do think that some of those extraordinary expenses such as clinge [ph] now clear through.", "Craig Huber", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Appert, Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Peter Appert", "So keeping on margins in the Platts business for a second, they had tremendous progress here in the last years. So I'm wondering if you're comments Doug are meant to imply that figure, thinking that margins have approached the appropriate level or whether you think there is more upside from here?", "Doug Peterson", "The way I think about it is -- there is necessarily an appropriate level. We have a commitment as well as an operating philosophy across the entire company that we're going to always look for continuous improvement and continuous upside. One of the biggest determinants of our margins are going to also be top line growth. That's one of the reasons that we also have a big focus across the entire company and also in ratings on commercial activities which are the things I'd mentioned before on needs they're selling relationship approach to selling deeper penetration, broadening customer product coverage, looking at contracts pricing etcetera. So it is a combination of how well we do on growing the top line that is going to have an impact on it. And if we can have some of that incremental sales drop to the bottom line, taking advantage of our scale. I guess long answer to the question but we continue to be committed to driving growth in our margin through continuous improvement, both from top line activities, as well as finding ways to continue being more efficient on our cost basis.", "John Callahan", "I just want to add one thing, that if you think about the second quarter, if you look at last three years or so, the second quarter has been our highest margin quarter for the rating business because of the larger levels of issuance during the quarter. So -- it can't predict the future but we would not expect necessarily to have those kind of margins each quarter in the third and fourth quarter.", "Peter Appert", "Understood. And then when you talked earlier Doug, about simplified pricing in the Ratings business, does that suggest more transaction based versus relationship pricing? And therefore higher price utilizations because of that specifically?", "Doug Peterson", "What it implies is that we had some of contract have been basically become stale or become quite old and we needed to go back and just look at the level of compensation we had been receiving for the type of activities that we were providing and the benefits we're providing for the issuance. I'd also say that another aspect has to do with how do we look at these long-term relationship contracts in the context of the size of issuance that had been undertaken originally when these contracts were put out versus what kind of issuance we see today. So there have been opportunities, this is something that we're going to continue to look at but it's based off of generally speaking, better coverage and better relationship management, those go hand-in-hand.", "Peter Appert", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. You may now ask your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "It's Steven Shulman [ph] for Tim, I appreciate you take my questions. First, I wanted to ask what you're seeing on the CMBS side. Now that you're back in the market, I think you talked last quarter about seeing the strong pipeline of deal, so I was wondering if some of those came through in the quarter and then how the pipeline is looking out, just any detail there.", "Doug Peterson", "The CMBS pipeline has actually been quite weak. The CMBS issuance is down over 60% in the second quarter. There were 10 transactions that were completed, we were on one of them and we continued to crawl our way back into that market. The pipeline now -- right now is actually quite weak, it's a trend that started off in the first quarter, I mean the first and second quarters continued in CMBS. So we do -- we have hired and great team, we tooled our approach to the business over the last couple of years, and it's our hope that we get included on more and more deals on the CMBS market overtime. We do continue to rate many of the single borrower transactions but those also have been quite weak during the quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That's helpful. And then second, could you talk about the slowdown in Platts growth in the quarter, the growth rate is still solid overall given your pressure in that market but it sounds like core revenue growth decelerated in a little bit. Was there anything specific that led to that slowdown?", "Doug Peterson", "I pointed two things. One, compared to Q1 -- Q1 was normally terrific growth quarter for our global trading services. It was up quite considerably in the first quarter, we still had very nice growth in that area, it's only 10% in the mix. But we saw very nice growth in the second quarter but it just wasn't quite stacked [ph] as what we saw in Q1. So it wasn't as accretive as we saw previously. It's still a challenging market out there in terms of the profit -- the profit pressure is not enough on the commodity space. We're still going growth but it may be constant to point or two.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "William Warmington", "Good morning, everyone and congratulations to Jack on the new position.", "John Callahan", "William Warmington", "First question for you to go back to the incremental margins on the Ratings business, with revenue up 24% and the adjusted operating is at 39%. It looks like -- I mean to assume a 100% incremental margin would be about $15 million coming from a cost cut, is that a fair way of looking at that? And Doug, what I want to go on the question is how should we think about the incremental margins on that business going forward and your minimum revenue growth on organic basis to achieve that kind of incremental margin?", "John Callahan", "I think that -- I mean, I assume the way you're asking the question is you're looking at more on a sequential basis from first to second quarter?", "William Warmington", "Yes.", "John Callahan", "I think some of the expense difference between the first and the second, and that general range that you mentioned had to do with the drop off -- what Doug mentioned in terms of some of the outside professional fees that we were paying either to lawyers or more significantly some of the work goes underway and risk the compliance area to ensure that compliance from the Dodd-Frank requirements which we had to do last year. So that money has been spent, we do have that risk and compliance investment now in run rate, so that benefit is from the expenses quarter-to-quarter. On a go forward basis, it's not like we expect minimal revenue, I mean we have to kind of -- to Doug's point, we're trying to be more commercially oriented going forward, we are going to be influenced by what's going on with the issuance trends. I mean I just would say that our forward outlook is not assuming robust activity that we saw clearly here in the second quarter.", "Doug Peterson", "Let me just give you a little bit about -- nobody's asked this question yet but since I'm prepared for it, I'll say a couple of factors that are beyond assets related to the overall issuance markets going forward, as you know from what we just gave you, we do see that there is going to be a reduction in the overall issuance for 2016 but if you look forward further, I mean you look at the 2016 -- looking out for to 2020 or so, there are two factors we're looking at. One of them is total debt markets, including bank loans which we don't necessarily rate. The market is large with independent growth by trillions of dollars, in fact it could stand over the next five years to $73 trillion market including a large increase in China. We do think that there is an increase in the combination of refinancing as well as new financing going into that. We are targeting through all of our business in market intelligence, couple of businesses there and then also in rating; more and more penetration of loan markets and through models and things like that. So we look at the size of the markets and how they're growing longer term and just the next quarter.", "Over the rest of the year though we do think that there is large amount of debt maturing between now and 2021, the issuance -- the maturations over the rest of the year are actually not that strong, that's why we see the full year down about 3.8%. We're concerned about the Brexit, what kind of impact that might have on issuance. U.S. interest rates and global interest rate outlooks have been quite volatile and they're changing all the time. So in the short run we usually expect possible volatility as you've seen, as you track this business; quarterly issuance can go up and down but with a very long run five year view we see some very large numbers, $73 trillion overall corporate debt market which includes bank loans. And then through 2021, $10.3 trillion in debt maturity, that's actually publicly issued debt. So we do see that there is a lot of activity, we're trying to build our business around this and trying to expand it beyond just being a single leading approach to the market, looking at bank loan rating, RES, different types of loan evaluation services, etcetera. So this is a big area for us to focus our strategy going forward.", "William Warmington", "If I could on Platts, just wanted to ask what has happened on the client side for us to anniversary the slower growth and see the return to the double-digit growth. Not that I'm complaining about 7% organic in that market, I think that's very strong but just traditionally it's been more into double-digit side. And yet in terms of the timing and whether it's operating expense on the client side or capital expense or rig count or what you think would be the leading indicator of that for us?", "Doug Peterson", "I think the leading indicators could be higher oil prices. It's probably -- I'm giving you an unscientific answer but if I were going to look at what are -- what's one of the most important correlations to overall volume as well as activity, it has to do with the price of oil. As you know, as we dropped into a very low oil price certainly this year even though it's recovered somewhat, there were lot of -- people at the industry -- you had a large increase in the falls from bankruptcies in the U.S. in particularly, in different types of oil businesses. So probably getting a higher price of oil would be the largest factor that could bump up growth to the double-digit range if that was still possible. We have still been growing quite steadily in the mid-single, mid to high single digit range despite this because it's still such a demand of information and for our prices embedded in different kinds of contracts but double-digit range would require more than just -- would require lot of work for us but in particular for the price of oil to be a lot higher.", "John Callahan", "Bill, I'd add to that. Just keep in mind, we're trying to grow off an ever increasing day, so double-digits of $700 million will be different in double-digits of $0.5 billion. So reality is the business is working hard to extend its product line so we have been investing to expand out the product line beyond the oil, on that note in terms of the business. And we're also looking to do more than just price assessment than we're investing to do more in the area of supply demand analytics. So I think we also -- in the longer term point of view need to kind of build out the product line and increase our offering.", "William Warmington", "Excellent. Thank you for the insight and Jack, it's been a great run.", "John Callahan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Doug Peterson", "Andre? Operator, I guess he is not there.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.", "Joseph Foresi", "I was wondering, I think you talked in your remarks about keeping the range wide on the guidance side just to take into account some potential volatility on the macro front. I was wondering, could you just have -- give us some idea of what would put you at the top end of guidance versus the low end at this point?", "Doug Peterson", "It's just sort of -- primary driver would be first this level of overall debt issuance because that's probably the first and the second most important driver. There could be a little bit of impact from what goes on with fund flow relative to U.S. equity markets that could impact our indices business. But now we have pretty good revenue visibility outside of debt issuance because so much of our business today is recurring revenue subscription base.", "John Callahan", "The only thing I'd add to that is, as you know in our indices business we do have certain, as you know we've changed the way we characterize our revenue. If AUMs continue on a very steady increase that would also be a benefit that revenue tends to drop almost all straight to the bottom line, so that could be another factor that would put us up towards the higher end of the range. And that's as per the funds flow and overall end market level.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. Okay, and then the Ratings business seems to be a little bit tricky in the sense that you had a very good quarter this quarter but then of course Platts is out there and then you have your annual outlook and then you have the outlook with obviously the debt levels rising there. How do you handle the staffing where the challenges in that business? Do you prepare for a pick up? Do you change staffing levels at all? I'm just wondering how the resourcing of that business is handled with so many different variables that's out there?", "Doug Peterson", "We have a resource model that takes everything you just mentioned in terms of our forecasting. We are able to manage the staffing level through attrition if we needed to and we're also able to manage it through our bonus pool, our bonus accruals, if that was something we needed to look at to ensure that we're accruing according to the kind of level of staffing we have, as well as level of activity. So those are two of the most important levers. But we've built a way that we've got some flexibility as well by having analysts that are spread around the globe, they're not all concentrated in London and New York. Despite the Brexit being a concern for us, we do have significant staffing and other European cities including Frankfurt and Paris and Madrid. We also get support from our partner CRISIL in India, they are part of the overall flows, some of the aspect to work for process of crunching numbers etcetera. So we have various variables we use to manage that and that's part of what John Burris Curtis [ph] is doing great job at.", "Joseph Foresi", "Thanks. Good luck, Jack.", "John Callahan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vincent Hung, Autonomous. Your line is now open.", "Vincent Hung", "On the improvement in contract service, have you take all the low hanging fruits, whether some left from the second quarter?", "Doug Peterson", "This is an interim process that could take a while. There was no low hanging fruit. This is something that's not -- it's very important for us to proceed from a relationship point of view and we hope that there is continues steady penetration of more products, more services to our customers as I mentioned. There is now league table for loan ratings and this is another area that we're trying to do more and more of it. We think also around the globe as most markets are more bank markets as oppose to loan markets. We're trying to penetrate with more services in that area as well. So this is something that we hope we can see continuous improvement in growth on the top line from many, many different factors, it's not just the contract terms.", "Vincent Hung", "And do you get much push back from customers on this?", "Doug Peterson", "We have good relationships with our customers and as you can imagine anytime when you want to renegotiate contract terms, it's never, it's not always easy.", "Vincent Hung", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now take our last question from Warren Gardiner of Evercore ISI. You may state your question.", "Warren Gardiner", "I just wanted to -- I was wondering if you guys could just give us a quick update on the fixed income index business? And then also sort of as you look out there, how you're thinking about growing that as you move forward? Thanks.", "Doug Peterson", "Yes, that's an area that we've been spending a lot of time on, structurally, as well as strategically. The industry itself is going through a massive amount of change with Barclays having changed hands with I7 bought IDC, with what's happening in Europe with the exchange transaction going on there and the interest of fixed income investments from the world. As well as all of the main asset managers, large globe assets managers looking at so much change in volatility in the shape of the fixed markets, especially with pricing and liquidity concerns creeping in. We think it's an area that it will continue to develop, we think there will be more and more ETF products and target day products, we retirement products, etcetera that are developed over the years. We would like to play in that.", "We're off to a good start with our dialogue with the asset managers and with ultimate distributors about these types of products and services. We have a core set of indices around the S&P 500, as well as some other fixed income indices. We have $40 billion right now in AUM in the fixed income index space. We are looking at all different ways to grow the business, whether it would be continuing to grow and penetrate with what we already have and what we're developing, as well as looking at the different properties that pop up for sale and whether or not they could be valuable to be added to our portfolio at the price is attractive, as well as if the capabilities are being attractive. So it continues to be an important potential growth area for us. And we do have dedicated resources to seeing how we can grow in this area.", "Warren Gardiner", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Okay, thank you very much everyone. With that let me conclude the call. I'm pleased that we had another strong quarter. The financial performance is excellent, ending up with an EPS growth of 17% and year-to-date cash flow of $530 million, etcetera is all something that we're very pleased that we've been able to achieve. But let me end the call again by thanking Jack Callahan. He has been a great partner and he is heading off to Yale University and they are going to get the benefit of his experience and expertise. So thank you, Jack. We wish you all the best. Thanks everyone.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call.

We apologize for the technical difficulties, we'll try this again. Thanks for joining us for S&P Global Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Rob MacKay, Interim Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we issued a news release for our third quarter 2016 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we'll provide an adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparison of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as managements.

We're aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors. And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at (212) 438-1247.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Doug Peterson", "Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call. This morning Rob Mackay, our Interim CFO, has joined us to cover the financial portion of our third quarter results and you will hear from him shortly.", "But let me begin with the highlights. We completed several business divestitures with the sales of J.D. Power, our two pricing businesses SPSE and CMA, and the equity research business. This leaves us with a more focused interrelated portfolio of market-leading businesses.", "Two tuck-in acquisitions were added during the quarter, PIRA Energy Group within Platts and Trucost within S&P Dow Jones indices.", "Several key management additions were announced. We completed the three-year $140 million cost reduction initiative that was announced during our Investor Day in 2014. We demonstrated continued revenue growth and productivity progress which led to an adjusted profit margin improvement of 320 basis points, with every segment delivering organic revenue growth. As a result of our share repurchases, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year.", "Our bottom-line result was excellent with a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS over the third quarter last year. We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion and we increased our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 which Rob will cover shortly.", "Before we turn to the results, I want to note three new appointees to our management team. Steve Kemps joined us from our Quanta Services as EVP of General Counsel. Martin Fraenkel has been promoted to President, SVP Global Platts. Martin previously led the Global Editorial Team at Platts. And Ewout Steenbergen will join us from Voya Financial as EVP and Chief Financial Officer effective November 14.", "I'm pleased we avoided any disruptions to our businesses as we put in place an excellent leadership team.", "Now let's take a closer look at the third quarter results. Reported revenue grew 9% and organic revenue on a constant currency basis increased 8%. In the third quarter ForEx reduced revenue by $5 million yet contributed approximately $8 million to adjusted operating profit and approximately 60 basis points in the adjusted operating profit margin.", "Most of this benefit was realized in the Platts segment which benefited from a weaker British pound. The company delivered a 320 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin. Together, revenue growth, margin improvement, and share repurchases led to a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS of $1.43 per share.", "In the third quarter, every division recorded organic top-line growth. Profit growth however was most pronounced at ratings and market intelligence with adjusted operating profit margin gains of 330 and 480 basis points respectively.", "Let me turn to the businesses and I'll start with S&P Global ratings. Despite initial uncertainty from the Brexit vote, third quarter issuance was strong, particularly in non-financial Global Corporate and U.S. public finance markets. This resulted in a 9% increase in revenue with a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 17% due to strong revenue growth and cost containment particularly with reduced legal and outside services spending. Adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points to 51.3%. ForEx had a negligible impact on adjusted operating profit.", "Non-transaction revenue was unchanged with growth in surveillance fees, offset by lower rating evaluation services fees. Transaction revenue increased 23% as a result of improved contract term, growth in debt issuance, and a 21% increase in bank loan ratings revenue.", "I also want to note that as we work to re-enter the U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS market there are 13 transactions in the quarter and we re-rated two of them.", "If we look more closely at the largest markets, third quarter issuance in U.S. was up 7% with investment grade decreasing 3%, high-yield soaring 49%, public finance up 16% and structured finance increasing 11% due to 44% increase in ABS transactions driven especially by credit card ABS.", "In Europe, issuance increased 14%, with investment grade climbing 42% driven by large M&A transactions, high-yield rising 37%, and structured finance decreasing 46% primarily due to 59% decline in covered bonds.", "In Asia, issuance more than doubled. However excluding domestic China issuance which we do not rate, Asia issuance increased 64%. Investment grade surged a 166%. However excluding domestic China it increased 67%. Japan was country with the largest increase due to the Bank of Japan's negative interest-rate policy. Finally, structured finance increased 2%.", "Two weeks ago, S&P Global ratings released its latest global issuance forecast. In the three months since the Brexit vote, debt markets have reacted very positively with unexpected levels of new issuance, especially in the non-financial corporate financial sectors and international public finance sectors. We now expect global issuance to increase 24% in 2016. This compares to the July forecast issued on the heels of the Brexit vote which anticipated a decline of approximately 4%. If we remove sovereign issuance from the forecast however, we anticipate issuance 2016 to increase approximately 10%.", "Looking ahead to 2017, we expect an overall issuance increase -- we expect an overall increase in global issuance of 5% driven by the ECB extending its quantitative easing policies longer than currently anticipated and further growth out of China. Excluding sovereign issuance, we anticipate issuance 2017 to increase 3% to 6%.", "Now let me turn to S&P Global Market Intelligence. In the third quarter, revenue increased 21% primarily due to the addition of SNL. Excluding SNL organic revenue growth was 7%. Adjusted operating profit increased 43% and the adjusted operating margin advanced 480 basis points to 31.4%. This improvement was due to progress on SNL integration synergies, operating leverage from strong organic revenue growth, and continued efficiency gains. ForEx had a negligible impact on revenue and adjusted operating profit in the quarter.", "As we have stated before in 2016, successful integration of SNL and delivery of synergies is a top priority for the company. We have made tremendous progress as evidenced in the margin improvement and remain committed to achieving our integration synergy targets and deliver on our expected return on investment in SNL.", "Let me add a bit more color on third quarter revenue growth and market intelligence. In financial data and analytics, S&P Capital IQ desktop and Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 6% with high-single-digit growth in S&P Capital IQ desktop. In addition, on a comparable basis, which includes revenue prior to our acquisition, SNL revenue increased 12% over the third quarter 2015. SNL and S&P Capital IQ desktop experienced year-over-year user percentage growth in the low-teens and high-single-digits respectively.", "Risk services revenue increased 10% led by double-digit Ratings Xpress growth. In the smallest category, research and advisory, revenue decreased 8% due to declines in equity research. With the sale of equity research, the only remaining asset in this category is investment advisory. Therefore, in the future, we will report investment advisory as part of financial data and analytics.", "Now let's turn to S&P Dow Jones indices. Revenue increased 6%, adjusted operating profit increased 1%, and adjusted operating margin declined 320 basis points to 66.2%. This is a sizable decline into third quarter of 2015 benefited from a sharp increase in exchange traded derivative volumes that did not repeat this quarter. I also want to point out that the adjusted margin this quarter is comparable to the 66% figure we reported last quarter.", "During the third quarter, revenue increased primarily due to mutual fund and ETF licensees and steady data license growth. Operating costs increased to support revenue growth and business initiatives as well as increased costs for purchase data.", "One notable example is connectivity expenses as we recently started up a third data center to provide additional backup capabilities.", "Often on our earnings call, I say new products that we have launched. Last quarter, I highlighted the launch of the JPX/S&P CAPEX & Human Capital Index in Japan.

It already has over $700 million in AUM.", "Asset like linked fee revenue increased 10% during the quarter.", "The exchange traded products industry recorded massive inflows of $126 billion in the third quarter almost tripled the inflows in the second quarter. Of the $126 billion of industry inflows, $58 billion went into the U.S. equity products with S&P Dow Jones indices capturing about 60% of those inflows.", "Average ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 15% year-over-year with inflows of 10% and the remainder from market appreciation. The quarter ending ETF AUM associated with our indices reached a new record of $914 billion.", "Transaction revenue from exchange traded derivatives decreased primarily due to a 14% decrease in average daily volume of products based on our indices.

Power results for July and August. Because this quarter has one less month of J.D. Power revenue than the third quarter of 2015, segment revenue declined 8%. Segment organic revenue though increased 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4% reflecting one less month of J.D. Power, and adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 40.9%. Organic revenue increased 4% due to growth in subscriptions, partially offset by decline in global trading services.", "The core subscription business delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth led by the petroleum sector. The global trading services double-digit revenue decrease is primarily due to the timing of license fees. Gas and power revenue was flat with modest gains in subscriptions offset by lower GTS service revenue. Metals, agriculture, and petrochemicals revenue declined low-single-digits, primarily due to lower revenue from SGX's listed TSI iron ore contract.", "We continue to expect modest growth in the remainder of 2016 as many customers continue to face pressure from low oil prices.", "On the business development front, we are building a world-class capability in energy, supply, and demand information. The acquisition of PIRA Energy Group, and the added capabilities of Commodity Flow and RigData, which we acquired earlier this year. PIRA is a leader in the worldwide energy market analysis and a great complement to our existing benchmarks. PIRA offers research and analysis in oil, gas, power, natural gas liquids, biofuel, coal, environmental, and agricultural markets.

I'm encouraged by the innovative thinking underway in the company to help tackle increased ESG needs of investors.", "Before I conclude, I need to point out a reporting change. Beginning in the fourth quarter we will report our results under three segments: rating, indices, and marketing commodities intelligence. We are doing this to be consistent with how we manage our businesses.", "In summary, we completed sales of J.D. Power, two pricing businesses, and equity research. We had consistent results with all segments delivering organic revenue growth. Bond issuance is robust in the third quarter despite the Brexit vote. Our focus on revenue growth and productivity performance led to continued margin improvement. Integration of SNL is progressing well and remains a top priority in 2016. And our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is increased to a range of $5.15 to $5.25 and includes dilution from the sale of J.D. Power, the pricing businesses, and equity research.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Rob.", "Rob MacKay", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will recap key financial results, discuss the impact from adjustments to earnings, then I'll update you on the balance sheet, free cash flow, and return of capital. Next I will discuss the completion of our $140 million productivity program. The financial impact of our recent divestitures and update our 2016 guidance. Before wrapping up, I will explain the new segment reporting that will be effective beginning in the fourth quarter and the data we will provide.", "Let's start with the consolidated third quarter income statement. There are just a couple of items, I want to highlight. As you've just heard from Doug, all of our segments delivered top-line organic growth. Collectively that led to an increase in reported revenue of 9% with organic growth on a constant currency basis of 8%. The difference is largely due to the SNL acquisition. Foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $5 million and had a favorable impact of $8 million on operating profit.", "Adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points. Approximately 60 basis points was due to ForEx, the balance was primarily due to outstanding top-line growth and margin improvement at S&P Global Ratings and S&P Global Market Intelligence.", "The adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 31.3%, an increase of 220 basis points over the third quarter of 2015 due to one-time benefits recorded in the prior period.", "Share repurchases over the past year have resulted in a 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. Taken together, top-line growth, margin improvement, and share count reduction combined to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a gain of $732 million in the quarter. The largest item is a gain on the sale of J.D. Power. The next item is a net gain from insurance proceed recoveries. And the last item includes net acquisition and disposition related costs, primarily related to the sale of our SPSE and CMA pricing businesses to ICE and J.D. Power to the XIO Group.", "And as we discussed earlier this year, our adjusted results now exclude deal-related amortization, which totaled $23 million during the quarter. All adjustments are detailed on Exhibit 5 of today's earnings release.", "Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately $1.6 billion was held outside of the United States. We also had $3.6 billion of long-term debt and $400 million of short-term debt. The short-term debt is the value of the 2017 notes that were redeemed in October.", "One other item that I want to point out is that the cash proceeds from the sale of J.D. Power were reported in the quarter. However, the tax on the gain will not be paid until later in the fourth quarter.", "Free cash flow during the first nine months was approximately $1 billion. However to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the after-tax impact of legal and regulatory settlements and related insurance recoveries. On that basis, free cash flow from the first nine months was approximately $1.1 billion.", "Now I'll review our return of capital. During the quarter the company initiated a $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan. This resulted in the repurchase of 5.3 million shares during the quarter. However, the final share count reduction will not be determined until the ASR is completed. In addition, the company paid a dividend of $95 million during the quarter.", "Year-to-date the company has returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.", "In March of 2014, we initiated a productivity target of greater than $100 million in cost reduction initiatives during 2014 to 2016. We subsequently increased the target to $140 million. Today we are pleased to announce the successful completion of this program. We delivered slightly more than $140 million in savings.", "You look at the chart on the right; you can see that our adjusted operating margin has increased by 900 basis points since 2013. The successful achievement of this $140 million productivity target was a key contributor to this improvement.", "While we are pleased with our recent divestitures; we want to make sure all of you understand the loss of revenue and profitability associated with these transactions.", "J.D. Power, SPSE and CMA pricing businesses, and equity research combines to generate $310 million of revenue, $108 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA, and approximately $0.25 of pro forma adjusted diluted EPS to our 2016 results before they were sold. This equates to approximately $100 million of revenue and $0.08 of adjusted diluted EPS that will be forgone each quarter. The recently announced ASR should help offset some of this dilution. We estimate that the ASR will increase diluted adjusted earnings per share by about $0.10 over the next year. We hope these figures will help you with your modeling of our future results.", "Based upon our strong results year-to-date and the expectation that debt issuance remained strong for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.15 to $5.25.", "We've also made changes to other components of guidance as follows: adjusted and allocate expense is reduced to $135 million due primarily to reduced professional fees. The adjusted operating margin increase over 2015 is now expected to be approximately 200 basis points. This is largely due to the excellent performance in ratings and market Intelligence. The adjusted tax rate is increased to approximately 31.5% primarily due to the timing and size of past years tax settlements. Free cash flow, excluding the after-tax, legal and regulatory settlements and insurance recoveries is increased to $1.4 billion to the strong financial results. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2016 will be another strong year for the company.", "Final item I want to discuss is the upcoming change to our reporting segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts will be included in a new segment called Market and Commodities Intelligence. Both fourth quarter results and full-year 2016 results of both businesses will be reported in this new segment. To facilitate analysis in the next few weeks, we will provide a pro forma schedule with results of this new segment for all quarters of 2015 and 2016 as if it had existed this way. This should help investors model 2017 appropriately.", "With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.", "Chip Merritt", "Thanks, Rob. Just a couple instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions]. I would kindly ask you to limit yourself to two questions that's two questions per call, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we'll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. First question comes from Ashley Michael Rao from Credit Suisse. You may now ask your question.", "Ashley Michael Rao", "Good morning. First question is when you think about the integration of the consolidation of segments of Platts into Market Intelligence and you consider recent divestitures, does this change to mid 30% margin target discussed on the last call for that segment?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes, good morning. Thanks, Ashley. So as we were looking at the sale of J.D. Power and then how we were going to manage the company, it was clear that one of the largest opportunities for the Platts business is in the data and analytics space where we've made recent acquisitions and see a lot of opportunity for growth in that area. ", "So by putting these businesses working together between Market Intelligence and having them both report to Mike Chinn, we feel there is opportunities for us there. We do, we will send out further information in the next couple of weeks about how these -- how this segment is going to look when we put these businesses together, but we will be targeting blended margin that's in the high 30s range.", "Ashley Michael Rao", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then as you continue to shape the company's portfolio and also execute on it as an integration, can you just talk about the types of assets you find attractive on the M&A front. Should we just expect more tuck-ins in ESG or in energy and just also some thoughts on how you're thinking about using M&A as a tool to drive growth in the fixed income indexing arena today?", "Doug Peterson", "Well you should consider that we have a disciplined approach to our capital allocation, which starts with investing in our businesses in organic growth. We are obviously going through our year-end review and our 2017 to 2018 strategic planning process where we're evaluating ways that we can invest in the business. So investing in organic growth, which could be expansion of regional areas of new products, of technology investments, et cetera is very important for us. Following that obviously would be ways that we can accelerate growth or expand into new regions or new capabilities through M&A. Then obviously finally come our approach to dividends and share repurchase.", "But when it comes to your question around M&A, we would be looking at many ideas and many options coming in, tuck-ins could be attractive for us, but it's something that we would do business by business, opportunity by opportunity, look at them separately as they arise. We have seen, as you know, tuck-in acquisitions have been a way for us to grow our portfolio of products in Platts. It's given us opportunities with different areas and services in Market Intelligence.", "Last quarter we had purchased a very small rating agency in Thailand S&P Global Ratings area. So we would continue to look selectively at areas but they need to -- we need to ensure that they also meet our parameters for growth and return.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may now ask your question.", "Manav Patnaik", "Yes, hi good morning gentlemen. So the decision to roll Platts into Market Intelligence I think that makes sense. I guess what I'm curious about is I think when we have asked this question over the last couple of months it seems like the answer was there would be more work done over the next couple of years. So I was just curious if there was any change there were you guys being conservative or is this just -- just tuck-in Platts away into that division?", "Doug Peterson", "Manav, can you clarify the question, what do you mean by more work being done, I'm not sure what the question is about?", "Manav Patnaik", "Has been what changed? Because I guess my understanding was based on your response that, yes, it could be an opportunity but it would be like two to three years down the road but it sounds like as things are changing much quicker than that.", "Rob MacKay", "Are you talking about the opportunity for SNL and Platts to work together?", "Manav Patnaik", "Yes, correct.", "Doug Peterson", "Okay, thanks. I didn't understand that. Yes, so when we look at areas that we have the largest opportunities in this company, we try to find areas where there are still large needs in the markets or areas that are unfulfilled and there is we see that the customers have made an avalanche of data, they need to make somehow they can make decisions around it.", "One of the areas that is a very fragmented business and there is high growth that relates to data and analytics are on the energy markets and SNL has a small energy business and Platts obviously is a very large energy business and we wanted to accelerate the integration of those two businesses. But more importantly take advantage of the expertise that we have in the Market Intelligence data machine and how they can work together with platform building out that data analytics business. So this was not something that I really felt we should wait. I felt that wasn't something we should wait for a couple of years for that we needed to move now but opportunities are going to start cropping up and we wanted to be positioned to take advantage of it as quickly as possible.", "Rob MacKay", "But clearly it took second place after the initial integration. So the number one priority for 2016 was getting SNL and Market Intelligence integration. And so this is, if you will kind of step two but perhaps it's done quicker than you might have thought.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay. All right. And then may be just asking the ratings business, your subscription growth was flat. Just some color there, I know you had some constant valuation services comps may be but curious on how we should think about modeling that piece of the business?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes, that was one of the areas that we had a little bit of a flat growth. It was on the subscription side. Rating evaluation service was not growing during the quarter that was -- that was one of the areas in addition to the how we're managing the business now looking at the way that we manage our contracts. So non-transaction business was flat at $343 million during the quarter. It usually grows around 3% to 4% over time but as you can see, it was offset by transaction revenue growth of $55 million from $244 million to $299 million. So there was a very robust growth in the transaction side. But we do continue to value highly this non-transaction side but the main factor was related to lower rating evaluation services fees.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay, got it. Thanks for the color and congrats on the solid quarter.", "Doug Peterson", "Thank you.", "Rob Mackay", "Thanks, Manav.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Toni Kaplan", "I wanted to ask about the Index business. Doug, I think you mentioned increased cost of purchasing data there. Is that exchange data or data from other providers and basically, how much of an impact does this have and are you expecting this trend to continue?", "Doug Peterson", "It was -- it was a very minor repurchase of data, the external data, it was one of the very small factors. But the main factor which drove the drop in the margin was the lower volumes of exchange traded derivatives on the CPOE and with CME the VIX and S&P 500 E-mini that was where the main factor was that drove the margin difference.", "We also put in place a third data, a backup center for to run our data center. So there was a small investment in data and operations that we think provides us with a more stable market approach. We want to get that redundancy in how we run our operations. So it's really a combination of a couple of things that rose, expenses rose, but these were kind of step functions none of these are going to have -- the cost isn't something it's going to be increasing going forward, it was a one-time approach.", "Toni Kaplan", "Okay, terrific. And then just on thinking about index gross in general, it sort of stepped down a little bit from low-double-digits in a number of years past to now mid-single. It could be a mix shift I know especially, just related to what you just mentioned in terms of these derivatives. But just trying to think about longer-term, how you think about the growth in the index business, can you sort of get back to a double-digit range there and what would be sort of the primary drivers that we should be thinking about in terms of long-term index growth?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes. So there is obviously a few components to the revenue. One of them we just mentioned has been very strong in the last few quarters here and which is the volatility aspect of our revenue, which relates to the exchange traded derivative trading volume that goes through. So there is that aspect to it.", "There is another aspect is, which is the core businesses that relate to AUM growth and AUM growth, which could be a combination of the fees that we get for the actual underlying components of a fund or an ETF or the actual growth in AUMs over time. So that's, that's a very important factor for us. And then we have our data feeds and data business.", "Generally, we're seeing growth in all of those. I think that the drop of the exchange traded derivative income is what impacted this quarter and also had very positively impacted the third quarter last year. So that's a little bit about that, about the -- that what you see there in the difference between last year and this year.", "But let me just give you a couple of data points about the growth in the AUM. So if I go way back I go back almost five, six years ago. If you go back into the end of 2013 there was a -- the overall AUMs was only $585 billion. It's now $914 billion as of the end of this quarter.", "And through that time there's been a combination of factors that have driven that growth. One is the increase in market value. So as the market themselves and the indices themselves go up that is a positive for our revenue. And the other is flows into the funds and you saw that last week in The Wall Street Journal, there was a series, the entire week about the shifting needs of investors and the changes in the investment management industry, which have been benefiting -- have been benefiting firms like ours that are in the passive index field. So we're not giving you any specific projections today. We will provide guidance for 2017 at our next earnings call, but we do continue to see the trend for this industry to be very positive.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open.", "Alex Kramm", "Yes hi good morning everyone. Just wanted to get back to the guidance, which I believe nobody has asked about but when I look at the mid-point here at 112 for the quarter, it doesn't really flip with the lot of the things that you've said, for example, you would expect the debt issuance environment to remain good. I know you also gave some of the impact from the businesses that you're divesting but I think it's like $0.04, $0.05 may be. So you're still arriving at a EPS for the fourth quarter that's basically below around the first quarter, which I think we all would agree it was a pretty tough environment. So can you flush this out a little bit more? What am I missing here? Why you're just being very conservative and so sorry, one more thing, you have raised your guidance like $0.05 each quarter, is there any sort of technicalities in how you approach guidance or what's going on there? Thanks. Sorry for the long question.", "Doug Peterson", "I'm going to start and then hand it over to Rob. From the point of view of the factors you actually gave most of the factors which were included in our calculation or understanding of our guidance, which has to do with what could be a very difficult environment.", "On the one hand, we've seen a very strong third quarter in issuance. It was almost unprecedented the strength that we saw after the Brexit. And we do project based off of the M&A pipeline and what we see for being some pull forward of issuance. And what we see looking at the investment banking calendar and the debt capital markets of depth of the big banks. We do see a strong issuance in the fourth quarter.", "On the other hand, as you saw with the Brexit that happened last quarter, this could turn on a dime. You could see there is still lot of volatility, there is still lot of factors, which we are very cautious about, you've got the interest rate discussions in the United States, you still have Brexit, you have the elections in United States, which have been quite volatile. So there is still a lot of factors out there that are impacting our external view and that external view has been driving our approach to where we ended up with guidance, but let me hand it over to Rob.", "Rob MacKay", "Alex, your math is similar to ours, where there's about a nickel going away from what you'd expect because of the divestitures, offset by the ASR. But we did take the bottom up $0.10 and the top up $0.05. So we're heading now closer but yes the nickel going away for divestitures and we're cautiously optimistic of what's going to happen in the fourth quarter.", "Doug Peterson", "Alex, I will point out one other thing, if you look at the last two years, you can see the first quarter and fourth quarter both in 2014 and 2015 were considerably lower on EPS than our second and third quarters. So it's kind of a consistent pattern that you see each year. I can't guarantee it's going to repeat but at least that we see in the past.", "Alex Kramm", "All right, that's helpful, thanks for the color. And then just coming back to the point of the restatements of the combining GMI and Platts, first of all, I think if you ask the investors they would ask -- they would argue that you are now bearing one of the best businesses you have in one of the businesses that people do not give a lot of think there is a lot of quality but maybe you disagree. And I guess that is really my question. If you look at the new combined segment now, how much of the business in terms of revenue or EBITDA, do you think is really businesses that are Platts like and may be have gotten lost before like things that are must have very sticky good pricing power there's things like the CUSIP database ratings reselling versus may be similar things that are more discretionary, easier to cut like the desktop businesses. Thank you.", "Doug Peterson", "So this is, this is a question about for us what we looked at was partially your question and then beyond that was what are the needs of customers and where do we see the opportunities for further penetration of data and analytics services with different types of client basis. And then going into the backend behind that, how do you run those to be able to deliver the fastest, the best way, and take advantage of our expertise across the company.", "So within the segment, obviously you're going to have the must-have products of SNL, you've got the must have products of things like CUSIP, in our risk services area, we have products which have become very important for risk management tools that we see as people are doing CCAR modeling and liquidity planning and living well, so there is an advantage to having all of those types of products together.", "In addition, then you got the Platts part of the business. So you've got a combination. I don't know the numbers off the top of my head that would be better if we talked about that after we put together the new segment information and we send it out. But there is a lot of must have data in there.", "And then remember that the traditional Cap IQ and SNL desktops have been growing very well. They're growing in somewhere in the high-single digit level for the Cap IQ desktop and over double-digits for the SNL. So even though they might have some sort of discretionary component to them they're still growing at a very good clip and in many cases substituting for other products which might be similar that are much more expensive.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Your line is now open. ", "Kevin McVeigh", "Okay. Hi, this is Kevin McVeigh stepping in for Hamzah. I have a question for you guys around margin improvement related to the rating business. There's probably some low-hanging fruits behind on the legal cost coming off, but do you guys see any pricing opportunity remaining still?", "Doug Peterson", "Well, if we take a look at the margin in ratings in September 2015 it was about 48% and we improved to 51.3% this quarter. Every quarter for the last year we've been -- we've been driving towards improvement. Last quarter, at the end of June, we had a 54.1% margin. As you've heard us say before, our goal was to remove all of the first areas of things like legal expense of ensuring that we had the right approach to managing our business when it came to compliance and control, embedding new technology tools to have more automation. We have a project going on right now called project simplify, which has the benefits of better control, of better workflow, and eventually it will also bring lower cost with it as well, as you have more streamlined operation.", "So think about our approach towards margin is continuous improvement. We will keep striving to improve our margins. I'm not going to give you a target necessarily today, but we do have a commitment to strive to keep improving our margin and that would come with a combination of better penetration into the markets where sales force through looking at how we can manage our contracts and our mix on pricing as well as discounting policies. And then on the cost side, through projects like simplify and other ways to manage the business more efficiently and more effectively.", "So you can see over the last few years, we have had a continuous improvement in our margins, and that's a commitment that we still have.", "Kevin McVeigh", "All right, thanks for that. One other quick question could you give us an update on where you see the upsides in SNL synergies over, next two-year period. You guys spoken about $100 million number before any sense of that.", "Doug Peterson", "Yes, we had given you a number and I believe it was at the beginning of the year, it was may be updated which was originally $70 million. We then increased it to a $100 million with a approach where we gave guidance as said that we get approximately half of the $70 million, which was the cost side during this year. We will update you on that, on how we are against those targets at our next call.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Vincent Hung from Autonomous. Your line is now open.", "Vincent Hung", "Hi, good morning. So on evaluation services fees, sounds like weakness that it due --", "Doug Peterson", "Vincent, can you speak a little louder?", "Vincent Hung", "Yes, so on the evaluation service fees sounds like most of the weakness that is due to the contract reviews, how much revenue do you usually get from that?", "Doug Peterson", "I can't give you -- your question -- can you -- your revenue was how much revenue do we get from where. It can range from 5% to 10% of raised revenue ballpark.", "Vincent Hung", "Okay. And on desktop and enterprise and market intelligence looks like the growth has slowed compared to last few quarters, if there anything to highlight there?", "Doug Peterson", "No, nothing to highlight there, we continue to see a very good penetration, a good acceptance to the market in that area, so nothing that I'd highlight at this time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Warren Gardiner of Evercore. Your line is now open.", "Warren Gardiner", "Great, thanks. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on how you're progressing in terms of regaining some market share in CMBS, kind of feels like that market is starting to pick up a bit. So just wondering how we should kind of expect you guys to participate there?", "Doug Peterson", "So during the last quarter, there were 13 CMBS deals of which we were engaged on two of them. So that was a beginning to maybe I could say get our toe in the water. We do continue to rate a large number of the single issuer CMBS transactions. And so we are back engaged in the market, we are engaging with investors and with issuers and continue to be out there showing what we can do. So let's -- let's hope that we keep getting more deals.", "Warren Gardiner", "Okay. And then strong growth in SNL I think you guys noted some of that came from -- a lot of that came from new user growth. I mean can you guys just give us some color where that's coming from may be just however you want to kind of slice it may be also how much of that may be came from price increases if any?", "Doug Peterson", "What we talked about user growth that is coming directly from users. Some of the uptick is also coming from pricing. As you might know, we have an approach towards pricing which is more of an enterprise model. We have decided to work with the sales force where we've merged the sales forces of the old SNL and the old Cap IQ businesses and what we're doing right now is working on an approach to highlight selectively enterprise-wide pricing for Cap IQ and you seen a little bit of it but we're actually rolling it out and phasing it out in 2017. So up until now, what we've seen continues to be mostly based on our prior approach to sales of the two products that with their own sales forces. But more to come on that and this will be another area we will provide more information on it in the next quarter call.", "Warren Gardiner", "Great, understood.", "Rob MacKay", "I apologize of creating confusion by talking about the 12% growth in use of the SNL. We're at the Doug's point. We don't charge on a per user basis to SNL. So it's necessarily direct correlation between user growth and revenue growth. But clearly they do charge based on usage and new users is a part of usage so that kind of feeds into that.", "And also on the early answer I gave on the 5% to 10% of ratings revenue from TRIS closer to 5%.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi good morning. Sorry if I missed this but any thoughts on renewing of the overall productivity initiatives for the full company and may be what's on -- what's next on the agenda there?", "Rob Mackay", "Thanks, Joseph, this is Rob. So we're continuing to really execute against the SNL targets that we set out and just continuous improvement in all of the divisions as we work through our plan. So no overall announcement on a single program, we're just going to continue looking for productivity in each division as well as flawlessly execute the SNL productivity and synergy targets.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. Do you expect that you may announce something as you go through your five-year plan or is that still, I guess being discussed? I know obviously each individual unit you have done well in increasing the productivity there. But I'm just wondering if there is going to be an overall initiative?", "Doug Peterson", "It's possible with our new CFO starting and going to the planning process into next year that's possible.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay. I'm going to sneak one more in here on issuance can we get any early thoughts on the ratings business for next year. I know you talked about issuance expectations for 2017. But just wondering what the underlying economic assumptions are there. Thanks.", "Chip Merritt", "Joseph sorry about that, we keep it to two questions per person.", "Joseph Foresi", "Okay, no problem.", "Chip Merritt", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now open.", "Craig Huber", "Yes, hi, Doug. First question on the rating side roughly the last year, you've talked about try to move away from some of the contract annual pricing contracts more to transaction based prices. Just want to hear a little bit further about how that's going, how far you think you are into that? How long you think that migration might take here?", "Doug Peterson", "What's most important for us is that we are -- we are re-engaging with the market in an approach towards commercial relationships and relationship management that allows us to have individualized discussions with our customers about the most effective way for them to tap the market, it allows us to show the benefits of having a rating. How much you people save by having a rating on their issuance costs and because of that we can have a new dialogue about our contract valuation.", "So it's hard for me to answer your question in a broad way because net-net, most of our discussions with our customers are one-offs, they're individual. But we are trying to approach the market in a way to get better contract realization overall but it's -- but it's again, it's a relationship management approach professional sales really market by market, customer by customer.", "Craig Huber", "Then also just a quick question for 2017 for pricing across the overall portfolio at S&P, should we assume more the same of 3% to 4% on average?", "Doug Peterson", "Craig, we never signal future pricing. We're happy to talk what we've done in the past which you're exactly right. Historically, we're kind of down about 3% to 4% across the businesses per year but we never want to signal future pricing.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Peter Appert", "Thanks, good morning. So Doug there has been some discussion of fee pressure on the index providers and I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of any flow through to your business because of that.", "Doug Peterson", "Well there we see that this is going to be an important topic in the industry. It's a complicated topic, because most of the pressure, well a lot of pressure is coming at the higher end, full service active management funds that seems to be where lot of pressure is starting and some of that is going into the lower cost mutual funds in ETF providers.", "One of the things that you saw in the last quarter was that BlackRock cut some of it, its ETF pricing. And that one directly could have a small impact on our business because of the way that our pricing is embedded into those -- into those that fee structure at BlackRock. The flip side is if this leads to higher AUM fees, higher AUM, we could actually benefit from this, if the AUMs go up, and we see much higher volume but this is something that we're watching very carefully.", "But it is something for the industry to see what will be the evolution of the structure. We believe that our costs generally are very low part of the total cost of managing an ETF or managing a fund. But we are aware that this is an important issue for our customers and we're listening to them and hoping that we can be a part of the solution as they look at how they're going to manage their fee structure.", "Rob MacKay", "And Peter the only thing I would like to add is that, it is really nothing new. I mean this kind of pressure on fee structures has been going on for a number of years. Unfortunately the growth in AUM, as Doug said, earlier just 500 billion AUMs over 900 last few years it more than offset that kind of pressure.", "Peter Appert", "Understood. And then Doug just quickly on the Platts business growth has slowed a little bit obviously this year for reasons which I think everyone can understand. Do some of these new product initiatives, the acquisitions et cetera potentially got to drive a re-acceleration in the growth next year, even if the oil environment remains challenging?", "Doug Peterson", "I don't know for sure if they will be an allowance to really improve our growth dramatically but what we're targeting with the data and analytics business is to find a new source of growth for the business. So think about it in that sense. We think it's an area that it's fragmented. There are a lot of different players out there, we have the right and we have the opportunity to start bringing in new services, new products. So we look at it as a source of growth, we look at it as source of new area which we already have a good grounding in.", "And you're right to point out that it is a difficult environment in the oil patch. There are prices are down, if you look at some of the major oil industry clients, their revenues are down by 50% over the last few years. And so they, there is obviously pressure coming from the customer side but we're looking at, if you want to think of it in two ways the diversification of our expertise into some other product areas. And also we hope and believe it could be a source of additional growth.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Andre Benjamin", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for getting me in here. I guess on Capital IQ, I was just wondering if you can maybe help frame for us how much revenue comes from data fees. I know that's a growing area that some of your competitors have spoken positively about and any push that you're making to specifically grow that stream relative to the desktop business.", "Doug Peterson", "Yes. So the data feeds business, we talk about the CapEx you desktop being roughly a $400 million business, but the enterprise feed is another about a $400 million business, a lot of it does same data only sold to uses really their computers, to back offices, someone does wasn't to key in the stock prices at the end of everyday to value the portfolio. So our mainframe feeds their mainframe. So but yes that's been a, it's historically been part of Cap IQ, as we've evolved the name of that segment over time but that's the relative size and it's kind of been a decent grower nothing extraordinary for us over that timeframe.", "Andre Benjamin", "Got it. And then as you get SNL fully integrated and that's no longer that the main focus I guess if you look about growing the business going forward, is there any potential that you could look to expand your reaching capabilities beyond the traditional banking and research analysts the use of deep data, I know some of your other competitors are looking do that?", "Rob MacKay", "Let me start then Doug, but just about a premise today if you look at Market Intelligence there is 30% of the business or so comes from outside of Wall Street. So we're talking about corporations, we're talking about consulting firms, talking about accounting firms, talking about governments, universities, so good 30% is already outside of Wall Street. I mean you should want to add any, Doug, there?", "Doug Peterson", "Yes, I would say that looking at questions slightly from the total business point of view not just SNL Cap IQ the Market Intelligence business. We see that there are -- there is need for more and more Market Intelligence. And as we call it the Central Intelligence for different types of people to make decisions in various ways that require interpretation of market information. So think about all of our businesses that we have now are related to market activities, whether it's fixed income, its equities, its commodities, its loans.", "We are a business that has the data and the information around market activities and we provide the benchmarks, the pricing, the data tools et cetera. So that's the way we are thinking about our business and we're trying to drive it by going out into the world to see what's changing when it comes to do with our customer needs, with technology, with FinTech, with how we see the regulatory environment is evolving what's actually happening also in growth and political and economic factors, things like the Brexit.", "And so we take all of those external factors and then, hope that we can interpret them appropriately to grow our business because we're delivering the kinds of products, prices, benchmark data etcetera that's the customers actually need to run their businesses.", "Operator", "Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Trevor Romeo", "Hi, good morning. This is actually Trevor Romeo in for Tim today. I just have one for you here. Just a follow-up on the high 30s margin target you set for the markets and commodities intelligent segment, the new combined segment. What are some of the incremental changes that you guys will need to make in order to achieve that and do you have a specific timeframe in mind?", "Doug Peterson", "What I would like to say is that, take that as our first indication, but give us a couple of weeks to send out the more detailed information about the segments and how they, how it's going to be put together. We will provide more on that and I'd prefer to also discuss this after you've seen that information and then on our next call.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Bill Warmington", "Good morning everyone and congratulations on a solid quarter and welcome to S&P for Rob.", "Rob MacKay", "Thank you.", "Bill Warmington", "First question for you on the index piece of the business. The big asset owners today typically pay fee to the asset manager that includes the fee for the management but then also fee for the index. And I've heard the talk about potentially unbundling that fee meaning that, if you could choose any index and you might be more likely to choose a lower price index. I just curious if that's a realistic risk or is it a risk to the pricing.", "Doug Peterson", "Today we're seeing a lot of different models that have started cropping up in this industry. But one of the areas which we believe helps our business a lot is that we hold the benchmark, most important global benchmarks the S&P 500, the Dow Jones entire complex of the S&P family of funds and family of indices gives us an important, important set of indices, which end up being part of almost any fund complex or investment complex that anybody ever have.", "So we think that there is kind of a -- because of the size and scale of what we have, we end up being part of that discussion no matter what angle you come from. We wouldn't be surprised though given the combination of the Department of Labor fiduciary ruling that came out and some other industry factors, low interest rates, and the low growth environment is another impact the shifting funds that are going into retirement and pensions, et cetera. We won't be surprised if there is a active dialogue that goes on from the industry about fee structures and things like that and we would like to be an active part of that.", "Bill Warmington", "And so for my second question on the Market Intelligence piece. Capital IQ, I think offers a pretty strong lower priced alternative versus Factset and Bloomberg. And over the past few months, we've been hearing a lot of discussion about cost sensitivity or increased cost sensitivity on the buy side to sell side and just overall Corporate America and I'm just curious if that value proposition is part of what's driving the strong growth within Capital IQ desktops?", "Doug Peterson", "Partially we have great respect for Factset and Bloomberg. They're great companies and they deliver high value themselves but we also compete with them sometimes head-to-head and sometimes there is substitute product that many times we're delivering to customers that don't even need or even have a Bloomberg or Factset.", "So there is a different sorts of customers that we delivered to and what our approach is to show the value of being able to harness the power of so much data and so much analytics in one desktop especially for people that don't need the trading capabilities, it's people that are analysts, risk managers, bankers, investment bankers, regulators, academics, et cetera that need the power of the data, don't necessarily need the instantaneous low latency information that might come with some of the other platforms but that's the way we sell it.", "Doug Peterson", "So first of all, let me make a couple of closing remarks. I want to thank Rob McKay for having been an absolutely fabulous partners as Interim CFO. He is our Controller, so he doesn't get off the hook, he still has to hang around and sign off on the book. And we're looking forward to welcoming Ewout Steenbergen to our Company in about a week and half and we're pleased that we were able to speak with all of you today. If you have further questions, please follow-up with Chip and we will provide more of some of the answers, which you asked. We will be able to answer, when we issue our information about the new segment and then we look forward to speaking with you again on our next earnings call. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenter's slides is available now for downloading from investors.spglobal.com. A replay of this call, including the Q&A session will be available in about two hours.

I\u2019d like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. All participants are in a listen-only mode. We will open the conference to questions-and-answers after the presentation and instructions will follow at that time.

[Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.", "Chip Merritt", "Good morning and thank you for joining us on S&P Global\u2019s Earnings Call. Presenting on this morning\u2019s call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our first quarter 2017 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.", "In today\u2019s earnings release and during the conference call, we\u2019ll provide an adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation\u2019s operating performance between periods and to view the corporation\u2019s business from the same perspective as managements. The earnings release contains Exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.", "Before we begin, I need to make certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates, and description of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.", "In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Forms 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "I would also like to call your attention to European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors. And we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Douglas Peterson", "Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call. With a surge of bond issuance healthy stock markets recovering commodity markets and improving global GDP, we\u2019re off to a great start in 2017.", "Let me begin with the first quarter highlights. We attained strong organic revenue growth in every segment. Ratings results were truly outstanding and with a highlight of the first quarter. We continue to improve margins and delivered 630 basis points of margin improvement and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 35%.", "We generated $306 million of free cash flow, it was typically our weakest cash quarter due to payment of annual incentives. We returned $307 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $6 to $6.20.", "Looking more closely at the financial results, the company reported 8% revenue growth and on an organic basis grew 18%. We frequently talk about the pull-through of revenue to adjusted operating profit being quite high. It\u2019s rather striking this quarter that the adjusted operating profit exceeded revenue growth. This can be primarily attributed to the markets in commodity segment, where divestitures drove, revenue declined to $68 million, we had adjusted operating profit only declined $7 million.", "The company achieved a 630 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin due to the sale of lower margin businesses, strong organic revenue growth, and productivity initiatives. ForEx had an $8 million unfavorable impact on revenue, with a $6 million in favorable impact on adjusted operating profit. Ratings realized the majority of the impact.", "The progress we\u2019re making to build a cohesive set of high-value assets is paying off. We were able to turn 18% organic revenue growth into 35% adjusted EPS growth through a combination of productivity improvements, share repurchases, and the inherent scalable nature of our businesses. In a moment, Ewout is going to discuss the results of each of our businesses in more detail.", "What I\u2019d like to do is provide a bit more color on some of the current and future drivers of our businesses. And let me start with credit conditions. While GDP is the fundamental long-term driver of issuance, spreads can influence timing. This is clearly evident in the first quarter. High-yield spreads contracted 400 basis points over the past year, making attractive entry point for issuers. And during this same timeframe, investment credit spreads contracted 74 basis points.", "We saw a strong bank loan actively in the first quarter, partially as a result of the rate and spread environment. Bank loan rating revenues become an important part of our rating business over the past few years. This chart depicts the growth. First quarter 2017 bank loan rating revenue was particularly strong, increasing over 140% versus the first quarter of 2016.", "Bank loan ratings are primarily issued on leverage loans typically rated BB+ or lower. But the volume of leverage loans and the percent of leverage loans rated by S&P have increased over the past few years. Leverage loan growth has been supported by strong investor demand with record inflows into retail loan funds and recovery in issuance of CLO since the financial crisis.", "In the first quarter, leverage loan volumes were very strong driven by tight spreads driving borrowers to refinance their outstanding loans. We estimate that 40%, 47% of the global volume in the first quarter was for refinancing. In addition, the percentage of leverage loans rated by S&P surpassed 93% in the U.S. and 78% in Europe. While many of you track issuance, we always try to point out where issuance takes place? Which type of issuance and the size of issuance of deals make a big difference in the revenue we realize? This was abundantly clear in the first quarter.", "Global issuance in the first quarter, excluding sovereign debt increased 4%, yet high-yield debt increased by over $1 billion, or a 172% because very few high-yield issuers are part of our frequent issuer programs. This provided a tremendous amount of incremental revenue to the ratings business. Geographically, issuance in the U.S. increased 23%, with investment grade increasing 15%, high-yield soaring 115%, public finance decreasing a 11%, and structured finance increasing 57%, due primarily to strengthen CLOs, ABS and RMBS.", "In Europe, issuance increased 3%, with investment grade declining 1%, high-yield rocketing 181%, and structured finance decreasing 21%, with weakness in covered bonds and RMBS. In Asia, issuance decreased 18%. However, the vast majority of Asian issuance is made up of local China debt that we don\u2019t rate.", "Ratings published its latest issuance forecast. For 2017, we expect an overall decrease in global issuance of 1%. This compares to the forecast of the 3% increase that we issued about three months ago. The most significant changes in international public finance, which had been forecasted increased 5% and is now forecasting to decrease 40%. It now appears the 2016 issuance in international public finance was an aberration and that issuance will revert to historical norms.", "Importantly, this is not a category that generates much revenue for ratings business. When you look at the chart, you can see that the categories that are most impactful to our revenue, namely non-financial services, structured news public finance are collectively forecast to increase in 2017.", "Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, in February, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the S&P 500. We often talk about the importance of benchmarks and the time it takes to build one. None is more iconic than the S&P 500, but originally known as the Standard 500 is introduced at a luncheon for the press on February 27, 1957 at the Lawyers Club in New York, with a turnout of 35 top financial writers.", "The initial 500 included 425 industrials, 25 railroads, and 50 utilities that were deemed most representative of the overall market. These 500 stocks accounted for 90% of the total U.S. market value. The 500 is groundbreaking not only for its breath, but also because it could be calculated and distributed on an hourly basis. Today, the S&P 500 is the world\u2019s most followed stock market index being calculated continuously.", "S&P Dow Jones Indices continue to build its business and several examples are listed in the slide. I\u2019m only going to touch on the first item. S&P Green Bond Select Index was created for market participants seeking to monitor developments in the critical areas of green finance. This pioneering index maintain stringent standards in order to include only those bonds whose proceeds are used to finance environmentally friendly projects.", "Platts is also actively expanding its business opportunities and two examples are listed here. We believe the U.S. Gulf Coast is poised to become a key anchor for liquefied natural gas prices. And our customers required that the new flexible supply from the U.S. is underpinned by both price transparency and the means to hedge.", "In response to the growing U.S. LNG exports, ICE will launch LNG derivative contract. These will be cash settled against the Platts LNG Gulf Coast market price assessment and these Platts-derived forward curves for daily settlement. The first OTC swap contract for Black Sea Wheat traded with the Black \u2013 Platts Black Sea Wheat price assessment as the settlement price.", "This transaction is a significant step towards the emergence of a new regional futures market for Black Sea Wheat. The Black Sea region is a major global wheat trading hub. But in spite of its size, this major trading hub has not had dedicated derivatives market, reflecting its own supply and demand dynamics.", "Turning to Market Intelligence. [I had the] [ph] instruction to provide a breakdown of the business by customer type. With investor concerns about the impact of the continued movement of assets from active to passive could have on market intelligence revenue, you can see that investment management makes up only about 25% of our customers annualized contract value. In addition, our move to more enterprise-wide contracts should result in less customer volatility.", "As we look to the remainder of 2017, geopolitical risk in Central Bank actions may create volatility in the second-half. There are number of positive trends that we have identified, including expectations for slightly stronger GDP growth in the U.S., European GDP looking promising, ECB continues to have a quantitative easing program, strong global equity market so far in 2017, and a steady shift from active to passive investing.", "There is cause for caution, however, with a number of risks, including potential for U.S. fed reserves to initiate more frequent interest rate increases and begin on winding its balance sheet from a Brexit negotiation and upcoming elections in Europe and continued devaluation of most currencies against the U.S. dollar.", "Finally, I want to share with you some significant changes, plans for a Board of Directors. Sir Win Bischoff and Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg two longstanding Directors will provide a wise count full oversight over many years of retiring. In the meantime, four new Directors have been added in the past six months who bring a wealth of business acumen and experience to our Board.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Ewout.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I would like to discuss the first quarter results and then provide updated guidance for 2017. Doug already discussed the changes in revenue, organic revenue and adjusted operating margin for the company. I would like to point out that the tax rate of 30.3% is below the anticipated full-year run rate of 31%, due primarily to the discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises through March.", "In addition, our ongoing share repurchase program led to a $6.4 million decrease, or 2% in average diluted shares outstanding. I would like to echo Doug\u2019s comments that with a 35% increase in adjusted diluted EPS were off to a great start to 2017.", "Net of hedges, foreign exchange rates had a modest negative impact on the company\u2019s revenue and adjusted operating profits in the first quarter. The bulk of the impact was in the Rating segment, with a $6 million unfavorable impact on revenue and an $8 million unfavorable impact on adjusted operating profits, due to weakness year-over-year in the British pound and euro.", "Now, let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a loss of $41 million in the quarter and included $15 million of acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments, a $2 million expense associated with an increase in financial crisis, legal reserves, and $24 million in deal-related amortization.", "In the first quarter, every business segment contributed the gains in organic revenue, but the gains in ratings were particularly note worthy. Reported revenue declined in Market and Commodities Intelligence was due to several divestitures. The adjusted operating profit growth varied by segments was 50% at ratings and 14% at S&P Dow Jones Indices.", "Once again, the impact from divestitures affected results with Market and Commodities Intelligence, adjusted operating profit declining 3% due to the sale of several businesses. Organic growth and synergies were able to make up much of this loss. Both Ratings and Market and Commodities Intelligence delivered remarkable adjusted operating margin improvement.", "Let me now turn to the individual segments performance. As Doug discussed earlier, tight spreads drove high-yield issuance and bank loan volume. And this resulted in a surge in high-yield and bank loan ratings and propel results for the Rating segments.", "Revenue increased 29%, including a 1% unfavorable impact from FoRex, 79% of the incremental revenue flowed through adjusted operating profits, highlighting the scalable nature of the ratings business. Adjusted operating margin increased substantially with 53.1%, due to strong revenue growth, largely offset by increased headcount and incentive compensation.", "Very strong transaction revenue fueled ratings first quarter revenue growth. Loan transaction revenue increased 4% from growth in surveillance fees, entity fees, intersegment royalties from Market Intelligence and CRISIL. Transaction revenue increased 65%, primarily from a substantial increase in high-yield bonds and bank loan ratings, as well as improved contract terms.", "If you look at ratings revenue by its various markets, you can see that while all of these categories reported growth, the growth in corporates was exceptional. And this is the category, where the high-yield bonds and bank loans are reported.", "Let me now turn to Market and Commodities Intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the first quarter, reported revenue declined 10% due to recent divestitures. Excluding these divestitures, organic revenue increased 7%. Adjusted operating profit was down due to the divestiture of several businesses. Despite these divestitures, adjusted operating profit only decreased by $7 million, as organic growth and synergies were able to make up much of this loss. Adjusted operating margin improved 270 basis points, primarily due to the sale of lower margin businesses, strong organic revenue growth, and SNL integration synergies.", "Let me add a bit more color on the first quarter. Recent divestitures masked solid organic growth of 9%. This was due in part to a 9% increase in the number of SNL, S&P Capital IQ, and ratings direct desktop users. One of the important milestones in the quarter was the launch of a unified S&P Capital IQ and SNL commercial organization. This is a critical step in harmonizing our product offering into cohesive enterprise commercial agreements and ultimately one product platform.", "During the quarter, we also expanded our content quality reward program to include most of the Capital IQ content. Some of you may be familiar with this program, as it awards $50 to those who finds an error in our data. And the final highlight of the quarter was the beginning of a strategic relationship with Kensho Technologies. If you are not familiar with Kensho, you should check them out. Kensho provides next-generation analytics, machine learning, and data visualization systems to Wall Street\u2019s premier global banks and investment institutions. We have agreed to a long-term commercial relationship, which will do so in product and data collaboration.", "We have introduced a new disclosure here depicting market intelligence revenue by three components. Risk services delivered the strongest growth in market intelligence.Thanks to mid-teens growth of ratings express and high single-digit growth of ratings direct. Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7%, as demand for data feeds continued to be robust.", "And finally, our Desktop products grew 8%, as the growth of the former SNL and S&P Capital IQ Desktop products continues to roll out as a one commercial offering. Finally note, data was $38 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2016 from businesses that were divested.", "Platts delivered reasonable organic revenue growth, as commodity markets recover. The OPEC production cuts have been very successful in increasing oil prices. Tensions remain as higher prices have increased new shale investments. According to RigData, North American rig counts have doubled since the low in May of 2016.", "First quarter revenue increased 10%. However, excluding revenue from recent acquisitions, organic revenue increased 4% due to modest growth in both subscriptions and global trading services. The core subscription business delivered mid single-digit revenue growth, with similar gains across all commodity groups. Global trading services low single-digit revenue increase was primarily due to the timing of revenue and strong trading volumes in petroleum, partially offset by weakness in metals.", "Of particular importance during the quarter was the announced inclusion of Norway\u2019s Troll as the latest addition of crude grade in the Brent basket beginning January 2018. The makeup of the Brent oil benchmark as we force over time as production changes path occurs. This latest change follows the addition of Forties and Oseberg in 2002 and Ekofisk in 2007.", "Here again, we had a new disclosure breaking out Platts revenue by four primary markets. You can see that petroleum and power and gas make up the majority of the business. The growth rates of each markets are depicted on the slides. During the first quarter, Platts delivered revenue growth in all of the metals and agriculture markets due to lower metals revenues and global trading services. Please note that about a $11 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2017 from recent acquisitions.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 14%, mostly due to a surge in ETF assets under management. Adjusted operating profit increased 14%, primarily as a result of increased revenue. Adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points to 67.9%, as revenue gains were partially offset by increased headcount in commercial and operations to support future growth.", "Asset linked fees experienced the greatest growth in the first quarter, rising 26%, driven by a 39% increase in average ETF AUM. Subscription revenue increased modestly due to growth in data subscriptions and exchange traded derivatives revenue declined 8%. The trend of assets moving into passive investments was very strong in the first quarter. The exchange traded products industry reached inflows of $189 billion, a new record by a first quarter and it was 2.5 times larger than the previous first quarter record.", "The quarter ending ETF AUM tied to our indices growth of $1,116 billion, up 35% versus the first quarter of 2016. As the chart shows, this was the result of $162 billion of inflows and $126 billion of market gains over the last 12 months. The $1,116 billion was a new record, surpassing the previous quarterly record of $1,023 billion set on December 31, 2016. The first quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 39% year-over-year, and this is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter end figures.", "Exchange traded derivatives faced a tough comparison to the first quarter of 2016, when market volatility was much higher. Transaction revenue from exchange traded derivatives declined due to a 10% decrease in average daily volume of products, based on S&PDJI\u2019s indices largely as a result of declines at the CME Equity complex.", "Now, turning to our capital position. There was a little change from the end of the fourth quarter. We continued to have $2.4 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of long-term debt, $1.8 billion of this cash was held outside the United States at the end of the first quarter.", "Our debt coverage, as measured by gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.3 times versus 1.4 times at the end of the fourth quarter. Free cash flow during the quarter was $306 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude activity associated with divestitures and the after-tax impact of legal settlements.", "In the first quarter, there was little difference, as free cash flow on debt basis was $307 million. As for return of capital, the company returns $307 million to shareholders in the first quarter, $201 million through repurchasing 1.5 million shares and $106 million in dividends.", "Now, I will review our updated 2017 guidance. Based upon a strong first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2017, we have made several changes to our original 2017 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance and the changes that we have made Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates. This slide shows our updated adjusted guidance. The changes are highlighted on this slide.", "I\u2019m going to discuss the changes to our adjusted guidance, which were as follows. We have increased our organic revenue growth from mid single digits to mid to high single digits growth, with contributions by every business segments. We have lowered our unallocated expense from a range of $145 million to $150 million, down to a range of $130 million to $140 million.", "Corporate unallocated is expected to be lower, driven by continued cost discipline. We have changed our operating profit margin guidance, which had been for an increase of roughly 100 basis points to a range of 44.5% to 45.5%. And we hope that providing the margin percentage is more clear than merrily providing the change in basis points. We have increased diluted EPS, which excludes deal-related amortization from a prior range of $5.90 to $6.15 to a new range of $6 to $6.20. And free cash flow, excluding after-tax legal settlements and insurance recoveries was $1.6 billion and now is greater than $1.6 billion. Our guidance does not take into consideration any potential policy changes from the new U.S. administration. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2017 will be another strong year for the company.", "With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "A - Chip Merritt", "Thank you, Ewout. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Peter Appert", "Thanks. Good morning. Doug, the first quarter results are obviously very impressive. I\u2019m wondering about your thought process and guidance. It seems to imply that maybe some of the strength in the first quarter you\u2019re looking at is just pull-forward. Can you talk to that issue?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, first of all, thank you Peter for the comments. As we looked at guidance, we wanted to take into account this very robust first quarter issuance, and taken a look at the rest of the year what we forecasted and what we budgeted. If you look at a report that we issued called credit trends in global issuance for 2017, as you can see, we looked at different categories.", "In my comments, I mentioned that, international public finance was going to be dropping and that was driving the overall 1% decrease. But for the entire year, we\u2019re looking at industrials being up for about 5% issuance overall, financial services about a 3% range, structured finance about a 4%, and then U.S. public finance down about 6% to 7%. That\u2019s \u2013 those were kind of the underlying conditions we used for issuance for the rest of the year.", "I don\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it pull-forward, but it was a very robust year. We also wanted to highlight this quarter, bank loan ratings. We have never really given the kind of disclosure we gave before on the bank loan rating product. As you can see, results are very strong in the first quarter, partially driven by the rate environment, the spreads have come down considerably, as well as what I\u2019d call a much more positive consumer outlook as well as corporate outlook for growth in the U.S. economy.", "As we\u2019ve always said, growth is huge. GDP growth is the number one determinant of issuance, spreads are also part of that. But we\u2019re expecting the quarter as well as the rest of year to play out, and that\u2019s what we used to build our guidance.", "Peter Appert", "Understood. Thank you, Doug. And then secondly, and this might be for Ewout. The margin progress likewise has been very impressive. I\u2019m just wondering how you think about where you are in that process? How far along we are and how much more there is to come on the margin front beyond the guidance for this year?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, Peter, thank you again for the complement on the margin improvement. I think what you have seen is, indeed margin improvement for each of the businesses on an organic basis if you take out the acquisitions and divestitures. If you look at the improvements of Market Intelligence, Market and Commodities Intelligence, what you clearly can see is, there are the growth of the business as well as the impact of the SNL synergies. This was in line with what we provided to you in terms of guidance for 2017 with respect to the achievements in synergies and the run rate improvement should \u2013 we should see during 2017.", "Clearly, the margin improvements in ratings was a result of the better top line growth and modest expense increase. So it shows the scalable nature of the ratings business. Obviously, this is not the level of margins we expect going forward as the new standards, but it\u2019s clearly a good improvement in terms of direction of the Ratings margins going forward.", "And then lastly, with respect to the Indices business, margins as you know are already in the mid 60% range. This is a range where we are probably comfortable with respect to margins going forwards. It\u2019s a very scalable business, the marginal expenses are relatively limited if we are able to add additional revenues to that business, so that\u2019s why we are confident that margins should stay in that range going forward as well.", "Douglas Peterson", "Peter, I want to add something. First of all, I think you know that we\u2019re committed to efficiency and improvement of our margins. The best way of improve them is through revenue growth, but in addition to that we\u2019re looking at other sorts of discipline on how we invest, where we invest our expenses, how we allocate. But the overall aspirations are to get to a sustainable low 50% range in the ratings business and then the MCI including Platts, aspiring to the mid-to-high 30% range. And then in Indexes, as Ewout just said, we don\u2019t have any specific targets, because we\u2019re already at such an attractive level and we do want to keep investing in that business for growth.", "Peter Appert", "Great, thanks very much.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.", "Mike Reid", "Hello, hi this is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking our call. I was wondering if \u2013 could you give us a little color on some of the progressing from the Index business outside of equities, including the custom indices and maybe an update on the Trucost and the ESG indices?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, let me take that. First of all, as you know over time we\u2019ve been looking at growing our index business in different types of asset classes. We have investments around the globe that we\u2019ve made with international exchanges to help them professionalize their index markets, as well as have distribution of U.S. indices and other international indices we have into those market, so that\u2019s one of our diversification strategies.", "Another one has been on different types of asset classes that are smart beta or different ways to weight indices. And one of the most important growth factors that we have is ESG. We\u2019re seeing very high demand on environmental, social and governance factors used by investors around the globe. It\u2019s, asset owners are increasingly demanding more and more information, as well as benchmarking to EST factors. That\u2019s one of the reasons we bought Trucost.", "Trucost comes with a phenomenal set of data and analytics, but more importantly a really high quality team. We\u2019ve integrated them very quickly into our business and one of the beauty of Trucost isn\u2019t just that we\u2019re able to develop new funds and launch of funds, we\u2019re up over 100 ESG refund already, but that Trucost also benefits all of our divisions across the company.", "We\u2019ve got \u2013 we didn\u2019t highlighted that we\u2019ve been launching some green bond assessments, as well as ESG products in the Ratings business and we\u2019re looking at ways that we can incorporate more ESG factors and climate factors into market intelligence data as well, so the Trucost has been a fantastic acquisition for us. We see a lot of synergies across the entire group for that acquisition.", "Mike Reid", "Okay, great. And do you have any more commentary on outlook of possible tax reform and impact to issuance, because it\u2019s still too uncertain to really give anymore color on that?", "Douglas Peterson", "Last quarter we gave you a view of what we saw at the time, there hasn\u2019t been enough of a change yet for us to update any of our thinking around that, but as the new tax proposal evolve, we will provide more guidance on that and more of our views as it more comes out.", "Mike Reid", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is now open.", "James Friedman", "Doug, in your prepared remarks you called out some of the opportunities in the high-yield market and that \u2013 and how that may have helped propel the quarter? I thought you also mentioned about your mind share and market share, if you could elaborate on that opportunity going forward that would be helpful.", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, first of all, as I mentioned, the high-yield market has been one that that we\u2019ve been able to benefit from. I\u2019ve always talked every quarter, we always talk about the importance of understanding the mix of issuance and this quarter the mix including a large component of leverage loan refinancing, as well as high-yield bond financing was something that benefits us on the top line because of the \u2013 because they are the types of organizations and companies we don\u2019t have frequent issuer programs with.", "But at the same time, while we benefited from that type of issuance overall, if you went back to Slide 10 in our materials, what you\u2019d see is that we\u2019ve also been able to increase our market share of the leverage loan issuers over the last few years. What we see is that investors demand the opinions in the valuation, the opinions and evaluations from S&P Global Ratings when they look at loans and we\u2019ve been able to benefit from that and a robust market and because of our increasing market share we benefited with the increase in volume.", "James Friedman", "Okay, thanks for that and then my follow-up. Ewout, I think you called out some headcount growth in Indices. Doug, I realize you\u2019re trying to discipline the margin there, but I saw quietly, I think you said that was commercial related, you know what \u2013 how should we be thinking about the revenue growth relative to the headcount growth?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thank you for that question, James, I think overall if you look at the expense development in the Indices business relative to the revenue growth, what you see is a couple of step up expenses that we are incurring compared to a year ago that should stay more or less flat going forward again. So to give you a little bit more details on that, we had the inclusion of Trucost. Doug, already just gave you some further explanation of the importance strategically of Trucost and how it is benefiting the whole company from an ESG capability perspective. So that is a step up cost that we didn\u2019t incur a year ago and that you see in the expense base of the Indices business.", "We had also the launch of a third datacenter during 2016, so that is another step up cost that we are incurring now in the first quarter of 2017 that you don\u2019t see in a comparable period of last year. And then we had some people on capability investments, which we think is important because we further want to expand this business, it\u2019s a business as you are very much aware of that has really a great perspective given the changes in the asset management world and the very large shift from active to passive management. So we look at this expense as more a step up expenses and the margin increase and expense increase from here should not be too much affected by those expenses going forward again.", "James Friedman", "Got it. Thank you for taking my question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Warren Gardiner of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "Warren Gardiner", "Great, thanks. So there were some headlines during the quarter and some potential M&A in the Index business, I would just be curious to hear your thoughts on that and then maybe also give us a sense about how you guys are thinking about M&A? What qualitative and quantitative hurdles kind of need to be met maybe beyond one year accretion and being a benchmark type asset?", "Douglas Peterson", "Well, first of all, as you know we wouldn\u2019t comment at all on any kind of market speculation and market rumors, but we do evaluate obviously opportunities in the marketplace, as you saw that we announced this quarter that we have set up a strategic relationship and alliance with Kensho, it\u2019s not an acquisition, but just in terms of the sorts of evaluations that we\u2019re always doing in the market looking for financial as well as strategic fit. And we\u2019re always looking to improve our portfolio in the parameters and bounds of what we\u2019ve defined as the markets oriented data ratings benchmark organization. But let me hand it off to Ewout to give you some thoughts about the second part of your question.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "What I would like to say is that, as a company, we are disciplined in every way how we utilize our capital. If it\u2019s organic, inorganic, as well as other ways we can use capital, for example, the most optimal way to return capital to shareholders. With respect to using capital for M&A, we are looking at a couple of key metrics, accretion of EPS is an important element; discount of cash flow methodology is a second important element; and the third important metric we are looking at and actually I\u2019m a very big believer of the importance of this is return invested capital. So we are very much measuring if M&A is ultimately hitting our hurdle rates and cost of capital over a couple of years in the future.", "Of course, you have to also take into consideration the strategic importance of acquisitions over time. But those are in terms of framework to ways how we measure and assess M&A opportunities in the market.", "Warren Gardiner", "Great. Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. I guess, my one another question there. Obviously, a really nice quarter in the ratings business. How much of that 29% year-over-year gain would you kind of attribute to improving contract \u2013 improve contract terms? And where are you guys in terms of what inning you\u2019re kind of in terms of capturing that opportunity?", "Douglas Peterson", "Well, in general terms, we don\u2019t give that breakdown. So we cannot give you a specific answer. Directionally, what we can say is that a largest part of debt was volume driven and contract terms is only a smaller part of the contribution of the 29% increase in revenues.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "And the other thing I \u2013 we can add is that, as we think about the inning of where we\u2019re at with this contract work, we probably got about half in 2016. We\u2019ll probably get about the other half in 2017, maybe it\u2019ll trickle forward after that, but really largely in 2016 and 2017.", "Warren Gardiner", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Your line is now open.", "Vincent Hung", "Hi. So you recently invested in Kensho. Could you talk about what this investment gives you not such, but more broadly on how you\u2019re thinking about the changing technological landscape impact in your business?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, first of all, we have been looking at ways to enhance our analytical capabilities that move into new areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence and cognitive learning programs. Obviously, we try to do some of that on our own and there are ways that we can task force, or special labs, or initiatives, as well as embedding things into our work workspace.", "But in addition, there are companies like Kensho, which are on the cutting-edge that we felt like it was valuable for us to build this connection with them to get access to people who are building new products and services that we hope can enhance what we do that we can learn from them as well as build products and services together. This was definitely done with that in mind to the kernel of your question, which is that, as the world changes, we believe we need to get on with it and move ahead with it, and that we need a combination of internal, as well as external sources for that kind of innovation.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "And I guess, it had just couple of things. We will be providing them with some data and they in turn will be providing us with some of their capabilities and will be offered our Market Intelligence platforms.", "Vincent Hung", "Thanks. And the next question is, could you give us an update on where we are on the project simplify initiative innovating relatively?", "Douglas Peterson", "Let me give you a quick update on that. First of all, for those of you that don\u2019t know a project simplify is, we have a \u2013 over the last five or six years, we have put in place a whole set of new policies and procedures and processes around improving our control in implementing new approaches to criteria, how we deal with documentation in our organization, and ensuring that we are operating at the highest quality and control standard for best practices, as well as to comply with the regulations that have been implemented around the globe, especially in Europe overseen by Esmond in the U.S. overseen by the SEC.", "So as we put in place all those different approaches to managing and controlling our business, we added on a lot of layers of activities and processes. And projects simplified for those of you that don\u2019t know, then is an approach to take a step back and reengineer and reformulate our processes with many more of them being automated, as well as eliminating duplication et cetera.", "We\u2019re probably, as Chip\u2019s using baseball analogy this morning, we\u2019re probably in the third inning. We have a ways to go where we\u2019re just moving from the design phase into the piloting phase. The project is going very well. I\u2019m pleased with the progress. I know that it\u2019s going to require some change. But net-net, we think it will continue to allow us to move improvement in our margins and decrease some of our expenses. But more importantly, it will improve our work flow and our quality and allow us to invest also for other grow.", "Vincent Hung", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Goldstein", "Good morning. This is actually Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. You had mentioned that part of the benefit that you received from high-yield issuance strength, because not many high-yield issuer is on the frequent issuer program. So can you just talk a little bit about your target in mix and ratings between transactional on recurring revenue? So are you just comfortable with your roughly 55 to 45 subscription to transactional mix, or would you look to alter that mix based on your insurance outlook at any given point in time?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "We don\u2019t target a \u2013 the right kind of a mix. But if I went back a few years, what I would tell you is that, we needed to look at a program, where we were ensuring that we\u2019re getting the right kind of contract realization from our frequent issuer program. If there has been any major change over the last few years, it\u2019s that we started looking at ways to ensure that we are having the right approach toward discounting policies on the frequent issuer programs. But we don\u2019t have a target mix. We obviously want to grow the non-transactional revenue, it\u2019s a valuable to have a more stable subscription like approach to our business. And in addition to surveillance fees, entity fees the royalties we get and then the basic frequent issuer program.", "The non-transaction revenue having that in our overall program is, it\u2019s a good base to have, but we don\u2019t have a specific target overall for that. Just to remind everybody on Slide 25, for this quarter, we did have a 65% increase in transaction revenue. It was and it was principally driven by the high-yield bond and bank loan ratings, as well as some of the improved contract terms, and we had a 4% increase in non-transaction revenue.", "Jeffrey Goldstein", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just at the time of the SNL acquisition, you had provided some interesting data on the margin differential between established businesses that were in kind of the 30%-plus range and still some unprofitable both businesses like metals and mining and financial institution software. So I was just hoping, you could provide an update on some of these developing businesses, and if you expect them to contribute profit this year?", "Douglas Peterson", "I\u2019m a little bit scratching my head, because I don\u2019t have that data in front of me. I\u2019m looking around if we have the specific answer to your question. But what I can tell you is that, philosophically, we have continued to manage all of our businesses for a combination of growth. We do have \u2013 this is, Ewout, laid out to you a few minutes ago.", "We do have programs where we like to invest and we like to manage our investments and track them, that\u2019s one of the nice disciplines that the SNL team brought as well as their approach towards opening new businesses and managing them for growth and investment. But I don\u2019t have the specific margins. But Chip has some \u2013 [has familiar with it] [ph]\u2026", "Chip Merritt", "Yes, we\u2019re not going to share the margins. But one of the things we said at the time, the new businesses we\u2019re looking in the metals and mining space and the international big product, there were losing money, because they were just playing new. We can say that the international big product is probably ahead of our plans or projections, and the metals and mining is behind our projection from a revenue perspective, and that\u2019s really going to lead your margin, because we\u2019re just talking about incremental margins on the revenue.", "So I hope, I believe that\u2019s helpful that once and look better, but we work together, we will be a little better than our models, as expected.", "Jeffrey Goldstein", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.", "Alex Kramm", "Yes. hey, good morning, everyone. I want to start with something a little bit bigger picture on the stock and the valuation. I mean, obviously, stock has been strong this year. But if you look at the valuation on fee or EBITDA, it\u2019s still below, at least, on my numbers your primary ratings PR. But more importantly, when you look at some of the other businesses and look at the comps, they are like the index businesses, some of the data businesses that are out there. It seems like the stock is trading at a pretty big discount.", "So just wondering how you and the Board thinks about this? Is there something missing, or I know you\u2019ve talked about the business mix and how committed you\u2019re to the different business? But do you feel like there\u2019s actually the opportunity if these businesses weren\u2019t together, it\u2019s really a realized \u2013 the value here. So just wondering how you and the Board think about the value that may be left on the table here, maybe because people are not understanding the businesses?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Well, first of all, thank you for the question. We don\u2019t comment about the market and market price and valuation. But we do obviously look at it. It\u2019s something that we pay attention to and look at. And what we can control is the quality of our businesses, the quality of our execution, the top line growth, the improvement in margins over time, and that\u2019s how we value our performance and that\u2019s also how we get paid. It\u2019s important that people like you are helping understand the business and communicating to the market the quality of the businesses and how we\u2019re performing.", "But as to the actual stock price itself and the valuation in multiples, it\u2019s not something that I can comment on. That\u2019s something the street actually has to comment on.", "Alex Kramm", "All right, fair enough. And then just secondly, some small here on the index side. I don\u2019t think you commented on the subscription side of the business. I know it was up 3%. But if you think about that number relative to pricing power, like, it seems a little bit softer than we would have expected. I mean, is there \u2013 it was whether there\u2019s some one timers maybe in the fourth quarter, also is the end market maybe a little bit tougher, given what\u2019s going in the active management space. Just seems like some of your peers are doing better there, so maybe a little bit more color on the subscription side of the index?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Alex, this is Ewout. First of all, I think, if you look at that line that will fluctuate a bit quarter-to-quarter. There\u2019s some custom kind of products that you see there that are fluctuating over periods, as well as we had a $2 million correction during the quarter in that line a one-time item of $2 million that should not recur during the next quarters again. So I think those are the main drivers why you saw a slight weakness in the line of the data subscriptions in the indices for this quarter.", "Alex Kramm", "All right, very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Research. Your line is now open.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just on how many of your customers right now are on enterprise-wide contracts? And any future impact you can share around the SNL and Cap IQ commercial organization? And is that in your synergy numbers already, is that upside? Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "I don\u2019t have the actual detail on the custom on what \u2013 how people move to enterprise-wide contracts. But it is the direction we\u2019re going. So think of it this way that, the SNL contracts were principally on enterprise-wide contracts Cap IQ, we\u2019re principally on per se contracts, and we\u2019ve been steadily moving the Cap IQ into enterprise-wide contracts. But that\u2019s actually the goal of our new and recent sales force reengineering and launch of a whole new approach to how we\u2019re managing the integrated sales force.", "One of the things that we\u2019ve done and we had a brief comment about it in the prepared remarks was to put in place a unified sales force for market intelligence, which is, as you know, the Cap IQ and SNL sales forces. It\u2019s built in a way that we have a combination of relationship managers who are managing relationships for the long-term. They\u2019re identifying opportunities. We have a sales force.", "We have an excellent high-quality sales services, organization and post sales support group. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re now launching and leveraging the compatibility and the quality of both platforms to build out this sales approach. And what we\u2019re doing there is also moving more and more of our contracts to enterprise-wide pricing, as part of that process. And our salespeople have incentive to up-sell, to get deeper penetration, as well as to move to \u2013 and to move to enterprise-wide contracts.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And just a follow-up question just on issuance. I\u2019m just curious if you guys view issuance as less cyclical relative to past cycles either, because they are secular drivers around European bank disintermediation, or maybe refinancing is a bigger piece. Just curious how you think about cyclicality of issuance relative to past cycles if anything has changed? Thanks.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "If you look over a long period like, let\u2019s say, 15 years, and we have a chart, which we typically have in our investor materials, not necessarily in quarter material. You can see over the last 15 years, there has been a very steady year-by-year increase in total issuance with the exception of 2008 when there was a significant drop in particular in structured finance issuance. And that structured finance issuance has never actually recovered from the bubble that it reached in 2006 and 2007.", "If you look at corporate issuance and sovereign issuance, financial institutions issuance, it\u2019s been also very steady underlying growth with the only year that it dropped us 2008, which was the global recession. So we look at it overall. It\u2019s a steady growth, that\u2019s where we plan around it. That doesn\u2019t mean that quarter-by-quarter, month by-month that mix and issuance is going to be the same, but we need to look at overall GDP growth.", "As I mentioned in my remarks, just some of the factors with U.S. economy growing at higher levels than we thought with the EU starting to recover with emerging markets like Brazil that\u2019s coming off of a very deep recession into mild growth in other countries in Latin American improving. China\u2019s growth is a little bit more robust than we expected. Those are all very good factors for us to look at shorter-term issuance. But longer-term issuance, we look at kind of on a steady path tied to overall GDP growth, as well as capital markets development around the globe.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thanks, Hamzah.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Timothy McHugh", "Yes, thanks. I understand the strong revenue obviously probably helped your ratings margins this quarter. But market intelligence is there. I guess, is there any reason why this isn\u2019t a level that should be sustainable, and I guess, how? If so I think it\u2019s at the higher-end of kind of the medium-term targets you\u2019ve set for that segment?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "I would say, this is Ewout talking. Good morning, Tim. I would say that, if you look at the margin in market intelligence, there were no particular items this quarter that jump out, as well as get margin higher or lower than what you should expect directionally in the future, you have seen a significant step up of 270 basis points compared to the previous period of last year.", "We are seeing the benefit of some of the divestitures and those were businesses with lower margin. We see the benefit of the organic revenue improvements and we\u2019re very pleased to see that this business is doing very well. Just want to point out one data point, again, 9% increase in desktop users compared to a year ago, 9%, which is, of course, a very good result to see that the top line is growing so fast.", "And then we see the benefit of the SNL synergies coming in. We gave you guidance on that and insight on that last quarter. We will give you an update later this year, but the SNL synergies, of course, helping the margin improvement as well. So ending up at 37.6% margin for the first quarter, that\u2019s indeed in line with our longer-term guidance relates to higher 30% range for this business.", "Timothy McHugh", "Okay, thanks. And then just the total margin guidance that you changed from kind of given us a basis point increase to a absolute number. Just \u2013 is that a increase in your guidance, or your expectation for the year, or is it because of change in kind of the format?. Just want to understand whether you kept your assumptions the same or increased them?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Yes, that was an increase from our previous guidance. Let me explain that to you a bit. The previous guidance was 100 basis points improvement of the margin during 2017, and that was measured from the base margin during 2016. That margin was 42.9%, so at 100 basis points, or at 43.9%. The new guidance is 44.5% to 45.5% to 60 to 160 basis points higher than the prior guidance we have given to you in terms of margin.", "So what you should read out of that is clearly a high-level of comfort that we\u2019re on the right path with respect to the performance of the business. We are having a \u2013 of course, a great start of 2017, and therefore, we have raised our margin guidance for this year compared to the prior guidance.", "Timothy McHugh", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Manav Patnaik", "Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on the quarter. My first question is just on the guidance. I mean, I think you said that all areas of your business \u2013 all your businesses were contributing to the increased guidance. The range still seems wide and still probably conservative. Is it fair to say that most of that is just at the ratings conservative, you guys typically assume early in the year?", "Douglas Peterson", "I would say, we are very confident by the first quarter results. We are not providing quarterly guidance, this is yearly guidance. We have raised the bottom end of the EPS range by $0.10 and the top end by $0.05. What you should read out of that is a good start of the year. Again, we are not providing quarterly guidance. And from our perspective, this is the most reasonable middle of the road guidance we can provide you, it\u2019s neither conservative nor aggressive.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay. And then, just your earlier comments around capital allocation and ROIC and so forth. So I mean, that disciplines sounds really good. And so, if it\u2019s not M&A, the balance sheet still is really underutilized in our view. You\u2019ve talked about how your ratings business obviously benefit from people trying to take advantage of spreads and ahead of rates and so forth. So the buybacks felt a little light this quarter too. So just curious on, should we be expecting action one way or the other in the next quarter or two?", "Douglas Peterson", "Manav, let me say it in the following way. We believe that there is an opportunity to provide more specifics in terms of our capital management targets and capital allocation targets for the company. Today, we don\u2019t have very specific targets. There is a limit, particularly on the debt level. There is a limit, we want to stay in the investment grade space. But where exactly in the spectrum of investment grade, we haven\u2019t specified.", "What we expect is that, later this year, we will be able to come back to you with more specific and concrete targets with respect to our capital management strategy. It\u2019s a little bit too early now. So I cannot give you more specifics at this point in time. But later this year, we will come back with more specifics on that.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks, Manav.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Silber", "Thanks so much. I know, it\u2019s late. I\u2019m not sure if anybody asked the pricing pressure question that you typically \u2013 you got on each quarter\u2019s call. So if they haven\u2019t, if you could answer that for me?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Pricing pressure in a particular category or\u2026?", "Jeffrey Silber", "I guess, both in market and commodities and then maybe feed pressures on the industry side?", "Douglas Peterson", "Let me take that question. On the market intelligence, as you know, our shift to a enterprise-wide model allows us to model very carefully, or the value that we provide to our customers, and the kind of service that we\u2019re delivering, it allows us to have a very good conversation about price. And it\u2019s not necessarily tied to a price per user. As you know, we\u2019ve had sometimes in the past with Cap IQ.", "So we look at that very carefully. It\u2019s a value-driven approach to how we deliver that value, and then the kind of contract that we\u2019re able to sign. So I wouldn\u2019t say, there\u2019s necessarily pressure there, because we\u2019re able to negotiate that well.", "When it comes to the fee structures in indices, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily talk about specific customer pricing actions. But we do have excellent margins and we\u2019re very \u2013 looking very carefully at penetration at new products, new services, et cetera, as a way to grow our top line growth, and we\u2019re very pleased with where we are in that business.", "Jeffrey Silber", "Okay, great. And then on the diluted EPS guidance for the year of $6 to $6.20, what share count is embedded in that guidance?", "Douglas Peterson", "We cannot give you those specifics, because then we would implicitly tell you what is the level of share buybacks we\u2019re aiming for during this year. I can just say that share buybacks, the company has a track record. We are a believer in buybacks that it is a good and value and handsome way to return capital to shareholders. So you may expect the company to continue with our track record going forward.", "Jeffrey Silber", "Thanks.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Craig Huber of Huber Research. Your line is now open.", "Craig Huber", "Yes, thank you. The other question for you here. This whole interest expense deductibility issue in Washing DC, you\u2019re Paul Ryan\u2019s tax plan. Are you aware of any country around the world of any significance that\u2019s gone from allowing full interest expense deductibility to none in sell-through, I\u2019m not, are you?", "Douglas Peterson", "No, we\u2019re not. There\u2019s Spain, Germany, the UK, they have different aspects of how it\u2019s implemented. But I don\u2019t know of any place, where they\u2019ve actually implemented in one sell-through.", "Craig Huber", "I mean, do you sort of think then, Doug, along those lines and be a middle ground, like a Germany, as you say, would it allow only interest expense deductibility up to about 30% of EBITDA, is that sort of the middle ground maybe here? And maybe you also said\u2026?", "Douglas Peterson", "I don\u2019t know there has been some interesting research and advocacy that\u2019s been coming out recently on what the impact could be on beyond just the real estate industry on other industry that is dead, in particular, community banks are very worried about what the impact would be if their borrowers on SME type activities are not able to, or not able to deduct interest. And what that means both for SMEs, as well as for the small community banks that provide that kind of debt.", "There\u2019s a lot of different angles coming out as this is being discussed more thoroughly and we\u2019re watching very carefully what all the different arguments are. I don\u2019t want to predict where it will end up, but I do know that there\u2019s going to be a lot of arguments are going to be surfacing on this.", "Craig Huber", "And to my other unrelated question, please, Doug. On average, what should investors expect for pricing increases this year across your portfolio? And is there any wide disparity between the segments?", "Douglas Peterson", "No, we never give any kind of specific pricing guideline, and it\u2019s especially for future pricing. We\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s something that we would \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be able to give you at this point in time.", "Craig Huber", "Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks, Craig.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "As everybody closes and we hang up on the call, I do want to thank everyone for your questions, and very importantly, I want to thank the team at S&P Global for excellent performance in the first quarter. We do know that we\u2019ve had a great momentum from how we started the year, and there are some potential upsides, as well as some potential clouds out there. But we\u2019re very, very pleased with how we\u2019ve begun the year across the Board. Thank you very much everybody for joining the call this morning.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning\u2019s call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. A replay of this call, including the Q&A session will be available in about two hours.

[Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.", "Chip Merritt", "Good morning. Thank you for joining us for S&P Global\u2019s earnings call. Presenting on this morning\u2019s call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our second quarter 2017 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.", "In today\u2019s earnings release and during the conference call, we\u2019ll provide an adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation\u2019s operating performance between periods and to view the corporation\u2019s business from the same perspective as managements. The earnings release contains Exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements.

Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Douglas Peterson", "Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call today. Building on the first quarter of 2017, I\u2019m pleased to report another solid quarter of revenue and earnings growth at S&P Global. Our benchmarks, data analytics and essential intelligence continue to be critical components of the global financial landscape.", "Let me begin with the second quarter highlights. We obtained strong organic revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in every segment. S&P Dow Jones Indices achieved outstanding revenue growth of 20%. We delivered 330 basis points of adjusted profit margin improvement and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 19%. As a result of our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $6.15 to $6.30.", "We returned $251 million through share repurchases and dividends. We\u2019re introducing a more in-depth disclosure of our capital management philosophy, which Ewout will discuss in a moment. And we intend to launch a $500 million ASR in the next few days that will be completed by the end of October. We continue to believe that reinvesting in our stock represents a great investment and a good use of our cash.", "Looking more closely at the financial results. The company reported 2% revenue growth and on an organic basis grew 10%. With a $27 million increase in revenue, we were able to increase adjusted operating profit by $63 million. This can be primarily attributed to the Market and Commodity segment where divestitures drove revenue down by $65 million, yet adjusted operating profit increased $11 million.", "The company achieved a 330 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin due to the sale of lower-margin businesses, strong organic revenue growth and productivity initiatives. ForEx had an $8 million unfavorable impact on revenue and a $2 million favorable impact on adjusted operating profit.", "The strength of our business model continues to be reflected in our results. We were able to turn 10% organic revenue growth into 19% adjusted EPS growth through the inherent scalable nature of our businesses, productivity improvements and share repurchases.", "In a moment, Ewout is going to discuss the results of each of our businesses in more detail. What I\u2019d like to do is provide a bit more color on some of the current and future drivers of our businesses.", "Now let me start with bank loan ratings, which have been a growing part of the Ratings business over the past few years, particularly in U.S., but also more recently in Europe. Bank loan ratings are primarily issued on leveraged loans typically rated BB+ or lower.", "Both the volume of leveraged loans and the percent of leveraged loans rated by S&P have increased over the past few years. During the second quarter, bank loan revenue of approximately $100 million was a key factor in the revenue growth of the Ratings segment.", "As you see from the chart, the longer-term trend for loan ratings has been positive but volatile. This is due to opportunistic loan activity and refinancing driven by attractive spreads for speculative-grade credits. I would encourage all of you who track issuance data not to overlook bank loan rating activity. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to \u2013 an incomplete picture of a key revenue component of the Ratings business.", "When tracking issuance data, we always try to point out that where issuance takes place, which type of issuance and the size of deals makes a difference in the revenue we realize. Global issuance in the second quarter, excluding sovereign debt, decreased 2%.", "In the U.S. and Europe, our two most important markets, however, issuance remained flat or grew as a result of sharp increase in structured finance. Geographically, issuance in the U.S. increased 1% in the second quarter with investment-grade decreasing 6%, high-yield declining 20%, public finance down 17% and structured finance increasing 59% due primarily to the strength in CLOs, RMBS and CMBS.", "In Europe, issuance decreased 2% in the second quarter with investment-grade declining 10%, high-yield increasing 23% and structured finance increasing 32%, with strength in RMBS, CLOs and covered bonds. In Asia, issue decreased 10%. However, the vast majority of Asian issuance is made up of local China debt that we don\u2019t rate.", "Ratings recently published its latest issuance forecast. For 2017, we expect an overall decrease in global issuance of 5%. This compares to the forecast of a 1% decrease that we issued about three months ago. Some of the key changes include industrials and financial services issuance have been reduced primarily due to the expectations for lower Chinese issuance, which is largely unrated.", "And structured finance issuance has been increased given year-to-year date strength. Most importantly, you can see that the categories most impactful to our revenue, namely, non-financials, financial services, structured finance and U.S. public finance, are collectively forecast to increase in 2017.", "Here\u2019s a new chart that we think you\u2019ll find very informative. It depicts 20 years of outstanding U.S. debt as a percentage of U.S. GDP. Debt is defined as both bonds and bank loans. The light blue represents nonfinancial corporations and the dark blue represents financial corporations.", "For the past 20 years, total corporate debt is amounted to roughly 40% of GDP. That means for every $1 of GDP, corporations raise about $0.40 of debt. This ratio is remarkably consistent. The ratio of financial corporate debt to GDP increased rapidly to a peak of about 70% in 2008.", "Since that time, financial corporations have reined in their debt levels. And for the past five years, the ratio of debt to GDP has been approximately 40%. We think this chart supports our long-time contention that GDP growth is the fundamental factor correlated with debt levels, and thus issuance.", "Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. At the end of June, we released the annual survey of assets. This chart depicts the highlights of that survey. Most importantly, there are $11.7 trillion in assets globally that track indices managed by S&P Dow Jones Indices. This includes 7.5 trillion in active money that is benchmarked against our indices and 4.2 trillion in passive money that is invested in products indexed to our indices. Numerous indices support the 4.2 trillion.", "I\u2019d like to highlight three important categories that should be of interest. Clearly, S&P 500 is the largest of all products with 3 trillion in assets. These assets increased 38% in the past calendar year. Smart Beta, which had 184 billion in assets, is up 26%. And fixed income with 41 billion in assets is up 34%.", "Next, I\u2019d like to share with you several new products. The first is the launch of the Ivy ProShares S&P 500 Bond Index fund. This fund is designed to track the index of corporate bonds issued by S&P 500 companies. Ivy ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund was also launched. This fund invested S&P 500 companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth.", "We also published the S&P Dow Jones Indices Carbon Scorecard. This scorecard assesses the carbon efficiency and energy mix alignment of a 2% centigrade climate scenario for major S&P DJI equity benchmarks around the world. The scorecard comes at a turning point in the integration of climate risk and investment opportunities. As countries limit the rise in global temperatures, market participants are looking for benchmarks most suited to the future economy.", "And last, we launched the Dow Jones/BM&F Commodity Index. It\u2019s the first index designed to be a broad measure of the Brazilian commodity futures market. This launch, in conjunction with B3, is part of our development strategy for the commodity derivatives market in Brazil. As you can see, we\u2019re actively pursuing our indices growth objectives in fixed income, ESG and global products.", "This quarter, Platts celebrated the 10th anniversary of eWindow. eWindow is an online data entry and communications tool that brings greater speed, transparency and efficiency to Platts\u2019 price assessment. eWindow was constructed by combining Platts\u2019 market-on-close methodology with exchange technology licensed from the Intercontinental Exchange. Today, eWindow operates in more than 100 markets across oil, refined products, petrochemicals and agriculture involving more than 2,000 traders.", "Last quarter, we highlighted our efforts in Black Sea wheat. Adding to our growing presence in wheat, today I want to share with you the launch early this week of Australian wheat futures by CME. These contracts will be cash-settled without physical delivery and priced in relation to Platts\u2019 daily assessment of Australian Premium White wheat.", "Market Intelligence is also expanding its capabilities. In May, we formed a strategic data agreement to provide transcripts to users of Thomson Reuters desktop platforms. The transcript service includes earnings calls, guidance calls, investor days and annual shareholder meetings. This extends our industry-leading transcript coverage and allows us to better scale this product.", "In addition, we launched Portfolio Analytics, a new tool for the small to mid-sized investment management market. This product integrates S&P Global Market Intelligence\u2019s point-in-time data with clients\u2019 own proprietary content. Clients can design custom reports that measure how their selection decisions impact performance compared to benchmarks.", "Clients can quickly assess and compare their performance relative to peer funds, exchange-traded funds and indices. And we expanded risk and credit analytics on RatingsDirect to enhance portfolio monitoring and added nonrated entity credit analytics and scores to Xpressfeed.", "With that color, let me turn the call over to Ewout, who\u2019ll provide specifics on our business results during the quarter.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I would like to discuss the second quarter results, introduce our updated capital management philosophy and then provide specifics on our increased 2017 guidance.", "Doug already discussed the changes in revenue, organic revenue and adjusted operating margin for the company. I would like to point out that the tax rate of 28.9% is below the anticipated full year run rate of 30% to 31%, due primarily to the resolution of tax audits and the discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises. In addition, our ongoing share repurchase program led to a 6.8 million decrease or 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding.", "Net of hedges, foreign exchange rates, had a modest negative impact on the company\u2019s revenue and adjusted operating profit in the second quarter. The bulk of the impact was in the Ratings segment with a $6 million unfavorable impact on revenue. There was hardly any impact to adjusted operating profit from weakness year-over-year in the British pound and euro.", "Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a loss of $13 million in the quarter and included $8 million from write-offs of a PIRA office lease and certain Platts software that was discontinued and replaced using Market Intelligence technology; $5 million of employee severance costs in Market and Commodities Intelligence related to synergy realization. Together, these actions will result in annual savings of approximately $9 million for the next two years and then $7 million per year thereafter. In addition, we excluded $25 million in deal-related amortization expense.", "There is another item that I would like to discuss that is not likely to have an impact on our financial statements, but in the spirit of transparency we would like to bring to your attention now and it will also be included in our 10-Q. As you would expect, we are continuously subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions.", "In May 2017, the IRS issued a 30-day letter proposing to increase the company\u2019s federal income tax for the 2015 tax year by approximately $242 million. The proposed increase relates primarily to the IRS-proposed disallowance of claims tax deductions for certain amounts paid in 2015 to settle lawsuits by 19 states and the District of Columbia.", "We vigorously disagree with the proposed adjustment and have filed a formal protest with the IRS to contest the matter before the IRS Appeals Office. This development does not materially change our initial assessment of the deductibility of our settlement payments. And since we believe that the likelihood is remote that we will have to make this adjustment, we have not recorded a tax accrual for the state settlements as a result of this matter \u2013 of this letter.", "In the second quarter, every business segment contributed to gains in organic revenue. However, the gains in indices were outstanding. The reported revenue decline in Market and Commodities Intelligence was due to several divestitures. Each business segment reported gains in adjusted operating profit growth.", "I find it very impressive that despite a loss of earnings associated with asset divestitures, Market and Commodities Intelligence reported a 5% gain in adjusted operating profit as organic growth and synergies more than made up for the lost profitability associated with the divestitures. While Market and Commodities Intelligence delivered remarkable adjusted operating margin improvement, we recorded declines in Ratings and Indices. Declines in operating margin are not something that we take lightly.", "The primary reason for the decline is the timing of incentive compensation accruals. Due to our outsized financial performance in the first half of the year, our incentive accruals were much higher than in the second quarter of 2017 than in the second quarter of 2016. In 2016, incentive accruals were weighted more towards the back half of the year. Excluding this difference in the second quarter accruals, the adjusted operating margin of both Ratings and Indices would have increased.", "Let me now turn to the individual segment\u2019s performance and start with S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 20%, mostly as ETF, assets under management continued to surge. Adjusted operating profit increased 18% as a result of increased revenue. Adjusted operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 65.1%, as revenue gains were partially offset by increased headcount in commercial and operations to support future growth and the timing of incentive accruals I just discussed.", "Asset-linked fees, which are principally derived from ETFs, mutual funds and certain OTC derivatives, experienced the greatest growth in the second quarter, rising 24%, driven by a 34% increase in average ETF AUM. Subscription revenue increased 16% due to growth in data subscriptions, custom indices and the addition of Trucost. Exchange-traded derivative revenue rose 12% with gains in S&P 500 Index options and fixed futures and options activity and mix.", "The trend of assets moving into passive investments was again very strong in the second quarter with the exchange-traded products industry reaching net inflows of $148 billion. Year-to-date, these industry net inflows are almost triple the net inflows in the first half of 2016.", "The quarter-ending ETF AUM tied to our indices totaled $1,156 billion, up 35% versus the second quarter of 2016. As the chart shows, this was the result of $175 billion of net inflows and $126 billion of market gains over the last 12 months. The $1,156 billion was a new record, surpassing the previous quarterly record of $1,116 billion set on March 31, 2017. The second quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 34% year-over-year, and this is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter-end figures.", "Transaction revenue from exchange-traded derivatives improved 12% with increased S&P 500 Index options and fixed futures and options activity and favorable mix more than offsetting declines in activity at the CME equity complex.", "Let me now turn to Market and Commodities Intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the second quarter, reported revenue declined 10% due to recent divestitures. Excluding these divestitures, organic revenue increased 8%.", "Despite the loss of earnings associated with divestitures, adjusted operating profit improved 5% due to organic growth and synergies realization. Adjusted operating margin improved 530 basis points, primarily due to the sale of lower-margin businesses, strong organic revenue growth, and SNL integration synergies.", "Turning to Market Intelligence. Recent divestitures cloud solid organic revenue growth of 9%. This growth was due in part to an 11% increase in the number of SNL, S&P Capital IQ and RatingsDirect desktop users. As evidenced by continued adjusted margin improvement, we are on track to achieve more than $75 million in run rate synergies by year-end.", "In addition to strong financial results, we made great progress on product enhancements as well. Some examples include; advanced towards a beta release of the new Market Intelligence desktop to the Investment Banking sector this fall, added SNL asset-level data to Xpressfeed to complement SNL fundamental data, added private company data for 77,000 Japanese and 2,000 Chinese companies.", "Looking more deeply at Market Intelligence revenue, all three components delivered strong revenue growth. Desktop products grew 11% as the growth of the former SNL and S&P Capital IQ desktop products continues to rollout as one commercial offering.", "Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 9% as demand for data feeds continues to be robust. Risk Services grew 7%, thanks to low-teens growth of RatingsXpress and high single-digit growth of RatingsDirect. And finally, note that there was $37 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2016 from businesses that were divested.", "Platts delivered reasonable organic revenue growth despite difficult commodity markets. Second quarter revenue increased 10%. However, excluding revenue from recent acquisitions, organic revenue increased 4% due to modest growth in subscriptions, bolstered by strong growth in Global Trading Services.", "The core subscription business delivered low single-digit revenue growth with gains in petroleum. Global Trading Services mid-teens revenue increase was primarily due to the timing of revenue and strong trading volumes in petroleum, partially offset by weakness in metals.", "If you look at Platts\u2019 revenue by its four primary markets, you can see that petroleum and power and gas make up the majority of the business. Platts\u2019 growth this quarter came from petroleum, which benefited from strong global trading activity.", "In addition, petrochemicals contributed 6% growth, while both power and gas and metals and agriculture declined 1%. However, gains in agriculture revenue were offset by declines in metals. Please note that there was $11 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2017 from recent acquisitions.", "Turning to Ratings. Revenue increased 10% against the toughest quarterly comparison in 2016, including a 1% unfavorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 8%, while the adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points to 53.3% due to increased headcount, incentive compensation and investments in productivity. As we have said in the past, we managed the Ratings business on a rolling four quarters basis, and you can see on that basis the adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points.", "Strong transaction revenue led Ratings second quarter revenue growth. Loan transaction revenue increased to 4% from growth in surveillance fees, entity fees, intersegment royalties from Market Intelligence and CRISIL. Transaction revenue increased 15%, primarily from gains in corporate bonds, robust bank loan ratings activity and structured products.", "If you look at the Ratings\u2019 revenue by its various markets, you can see the greatest gains were in corporates and structured finance. Bank loan ratings are part of corporates and boosted results in this market. The only market that declined was government due to the 17% decline in U.S. public issuance that Doug mentioned.", "Now turning to our capital position. There was little change from the end of the fourth quarter. We continue to have $2.4 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of long-term debt. $1.6 billion of this cash was held outside the United States at the end of the second quarter. Our debt coverage, as measured by adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA, was 2.0x versus 2.1x at the end of 2016. This is a new metric that I will discuss in a moment.", "Year-to-date, free cash flow was $564 million. However, to get a better sense of our underlying cash generation from operations, it is important to exclude the activity associated with divestitures and the after-tax impact of legal settlements. On that basis, year-to-date free cash flow was $635 million. As for return of capital, the company returned $251 million to shareholders in the second quarter, $145 million through repurchasing 1.1 million shares and $106 million in dividends.", "At this time, I would like to outline our new capital management philosophy. Let me start with a few broad points. We are continuously analyzing a wide range of internal investments and acquisitions, allocating capital to the highest-returning projects and holding our management team accountable. We\u2019ll continue to return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends while maintaining a strong balance sheet.", "Internally, we need to focus on the following key points. Ensure that we are responsible stewards of shareholder capital; maintain a rigorous capital allocation framework; demand business line accountability; perpetuate a culture where businesses compete for capital to optimize our portfolio; and continue maximizing organic growth prospects; maintain a capital-light, cash flow-generative business model; and utilize our experience to continue to be disciplined acquirers.", "As we think about our capital allocation framework more specifically, we routinely explore and analyze internal and inorganic growth opportunities in order to deliver upon our strategic goals and enhance our competitive positioning. Management conducts an in-depth review of each potential opportunity within a consistent framework. Strategic fit is paramount to all decisions.", "This framework includes the following key financial metrics; NPV, cash ROIC, IRR and earnings contribution. Afterwards, each project is followed up with a rigorous post-acquisition review process. We expect our normal course business capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million annually.", "For long-term capital return guidance, we expect total payout to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends to be at least 75% of annual free cash flow, excluding certain items. We intend to continue our 44-year track record of steady annual dividend growth and repurchase shares in a disciplined manner. It is important to us that we maintain a prudent financial profile.", "To that end, I want to share three key points. We are committed to remain investment-grade rated. We target an average minimum U.S. cash balance of $200 million. Within our current business mix, we target an adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.75 to 2.25. Adjusted growth leverage includes debt, the unfunded portion of pension liabilities, the S&P DJI put option and the expected NPV of operating leases. We are moving to this new metric to be consistent with the way that our primary rating agency evaluates our leverage.", "Finally, I want to review our acquisition philosophy. From a strategic priorities perspective, we\u2019ll continue to pursue both skill-driven and tuck-in acquisitions. We\u2019re interested in opportunities that augment our benchmark, proprietary data and tools and analytics capabilities, provide geographic diversification, bolster recurring revenues and/or provide synergies.", "Potential areas of strategic interest by division include; in Ratings, non-U.S. opportunities; in Market Intelligence, expense, risk services and new technologies; in Platts, supply-demand analytics and additional commodity capabilities; and in Index, fixed income, ESG and international indices.", "Our specific financial criteria includes; cash ROIC in excess of hurdle rate upon full synergy realization, desire to become EPS-accretive within a reasonable timeframe. And in the event that adjusted leverage exceeds 2.25x, we would expect to return to our stated range within 18 to 24 months.", "Now I will review our updated 2017 guidance. Based upon a strong first half and our expectations for the remainder of 2017, we have made several changes to our 2017 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance and the changes that we have made. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates.", "This slide shows our updated adjusted guidance. The changes are highlighted on this slide. I\u2019m going to discuss the changes to our adjusted guidance which were as follows. We have increased our organic revenue growth from mid to high single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, with contributions by every business segment.", "We have lowered our unallocated expense from a range of $130 million to $140 million down to a range of $130 million to $135 million, driven by continued cost discipline and our ability to tighten the range as the year has progressed. We have increased our operating profit margin guidance from a range of 44.5% to 45.5% to a range of 45% to 46%.", "We have lowered interest expense by $5 million to $150 million and we have increased diluted EPS, which excludes deal-related amortization from a prior range of $6 to $6.20 to a new range of $6.15 to $6.30. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2017 will be another strong year for the company.", "With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.", "Chip Merritt", "Thanks, Ewout. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. Please press Star 1 to indicate that you wish to enter the queue to ask a question. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press Star 2. I would kindly ask that you limit yourself to two questions, that\u2019s two questions, in order to allow time for other callers during today\u2019s Q&A session.", "If you\u2019ve been listening through a speaker phone but would like to now ask a question, we ask that you lift your handset prior to pressing Star 1 and remain on the handset until your question has been answered. This will ensure better sound quality.", "Operator, we\u2019ll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. This question comes from Manav Patnaik. Sir, you may now ask your question.", "Manav Patnaik", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. The first question is just around the Ratings margins again. You mentioned three points; incentive comp, increased headcount and productivity. I was just wondering, on the incentive comp, like, was this an odd quarter compared to prior years, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever called that out as an impact? And then on the headcount side of things, where are you increasing the headcount, because it sounds like your competitors are reducing them? So maybe just some color there would be helpful.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Good morning, Manav. This is Ewout. Let me give you a little bit more perspective on that development. If you look at incentive compensation accrual in the first half of 2016, the accrual was much lower at a level compared to the first half of this year, and that was directly correlated with the business and the profitability levels in 2016, which was at a lower level, as you will recall, compared to 2017.", "So the majority of the difference in expenses and therefore the impact on margins for Ratings year-over-year is driven by that increased level of incentive compensation accrual year-over-year. We expect that to normalize in the second half of this year. So this should correct itself in the second half of 2017, but we see this more as really a timing effect than that it is an effect of absolute expense increase.", "With respect to headcount, I would consider that more a smaller part of the increase that has more to do with growth of the business, investments in efficiency, technology. You know that we are investing in Project Simplify, which would help the workflow and efficiency of the Ratings business going forward. But overall, that\u2019s a smaller part of the overall expense increase and had a smaller impact on the margin this quarter.", "Manav Patnaik", "Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And by the way, thank you very much for the capital allocation details and so forth. I guess, maybe we were expecting it later in the year than now. But maybe for you and Doug, does that \u2013 and you obviously have the 500 million ASR you put out in the press release. Does that mean your pipeline maybe for the larger deals is not as active, or should I be reading anything into that other than maybe just timing?", "Douglas Peterson", "No, you shouldn\u2019t be reading anything other into that. As we gave you in the outline of the capital allocation framework, we have a set of criteria that we look at for our businesses to continue to grow and invest. We\u2019re making excellent progress on our performance objectives that we have of growth and excellence across all of the businesses, as you can see, playing out from our product innovation and business innovation as well as financial results. So you shouldn\u2019t read anything into that.", "We\u2019re always taking a look at what would be ways that we could enhance our growth, whether it\u2019s organic or acquisitions. What you should really read into it is that when Ewout came onboard, we had a goal to refine our capital allocation philosophy. It was something that was taken into account by our management. Ewout\u2019s done a great job getting that done as well as with our Board of Directors to ensure that we\u2019re all aligned on how we want to invest for growth in the future.", "Manav Patnaik", "Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks, Manav.", "Operator", "Thank you, Manav. The next question comes from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Sir, you may ask your question.", "Peter Appert", "Thank you. Good morning. Doug, I\u2019m just wondering, in the context of margins being down slightly in the Ratings and indices business, does that suggest that perhaps we\u2019re getting to the point where margins have been optimized? Really asking in terms of \u2013 just trying to understand if there\u2019s much more upside to come.", "Douglas Peterson", "Let me answer it from the point of view that we felt that, over time the best driver of our margin improvement has been our growth of our top line. We are still looking towards growth across all of the businesses. We obviously have views about what will happen in the markets related to the European situation, global economic factors. We\u2019re looking at what we think will be the impact of the Federal Reserve and ECB changes to interest rate policy. So top line growth is always going to be one of the most important drivers of that.", "But let me assure you that we remain committed to looking at how we can run the business more efficiently. There are ways that we can still drive improvement in productivity in our businesses directly. And as Ewout mentioned, we\u2019re doing a lot more at the unallocated expense and the corporate center to see how we can also deliver a more effective approach to managing the companies and how we allocate central expenses. So let me reassure you that we\u2019re committed to continued productivity across all of the businesses.", "Peter Appert", "Thanks, Doug. And then relevant to one part of your comments there, your assessment please of the Ratings outlook for the second half?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes. Ratings outlook for the second half, well, first of all, in the first half, it was actually a very choppy quarter. It was one where, despite looking at kind of the smooth averages across the board in the U.S.; industrials, financial services, public finance were all down. In Europe, the only sector that was up were corporates. Financial services were down. Asia was down. But what really came through was structured finance. Structured finance was very strong in the quarter, in particular loans and CMBS. And there was also resurgence of activity in Europe of CMBS and ABS. So you saw a real offset on the corporate side, which was weak, offset by structured finance.", "And then part of what you saw \u2013 one of the first slides I presented was the loan slide because loans were a really important story of the first half of the year. The second half of the year, we\u2019ve seen a pretty decent start to the second quarter, especially in loans. Again, loans could be slowing down. And then across the board, we\u2019ve been seeing activity. You know that July and August are always slow months. But talking to the investment banks, looking at what the issuance could be coming, we still look at the second half. And based on the guidance that we gave today, we\u2019ve built in our outlook for the second half on what we think would be a moderately active second half of the year.", "Peter Appert", "Great. Thanks, Doug.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thanks, Peter.", "Operator", "Thank you, Peter. The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Ma\u2019am, your line is now open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "[Audio Gap] so 2Q margin within Market and Commodities Intelligence was similar to the margin last quarter at about 37.5%. How should we be thinking about the progression from here to your stated target of mid to high 30s in that segment? Is it mainly from SNL synergies? Will there be core expansion as well? And then, I guess based on that, is there upside to your current target?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Well, let me give you a couple of perspectives what we see happening in the segments. First of all, indeed, we expect to continue with realizing the SNL synergies. We are on track to achieve the 75 million of run-rate synergies by the end of this year. And as you know, we have a total commitment of 100 million of synergies, so another 25 million of synergies to be achieved then post 2017. So we\u2019re very well on track and we think those will help to continue to deliver the margins.", "Secondly, if you look at Market Intelligence, the business is seeing very favorable growth. I particularly like the 11% growth in desktop users. That\u2019s a very impressive number. It\u2019s very clear that there is a high demand for our desktop products. It\u2019s an attractive product priced at an attractive level, so it\u2019s doing very well in the markets. So a combination of the top line growth plus efficiency and synergies, we believe, overall that should help this particular segment. If you look at the margin improvement of 530 basis points year-over-year, we think that\u2019s overall a very impressive result.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then just on the index business, I want to know relative to the average fee rate you\u2019re charging across S&P-linked funds, if you\u2019re starting to see any pressure there and maybe if you could ballpark a magnitude. And then just how do you think about the potential offset between increasing flows but a potentially declining fee rate?", "Douglas Peterson", "So as we\u2019ve said in the past that there\u2019s always downward pressure in this marketplace, but because of the elasticity involved and the massive surge of flows that takes place, you really don\u2019t see it apparent in our numbers. And we think that will continue.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Research. You may now ask your question.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Good morning. The first question is just if you could remind us how much of the overall business currently is subscription? Is that still 60%? And as you look long term, should that number get bigger towards like a 75% range? Just help us think about the portfolio evolving to more of a subscription model as the businesses that are not Ratings start to grow.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "This is Ewout. Let me give you some numbers. I\u2019ll give you some perspective on this. You know that in Ratings, we have not really a distinction between subscription and non-subscription. We more look at a distinction between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction was a little bit more than 50% this quarter. That was due to the high issuance levels and the bank loans. So if you look at transaction, it was 394 million of revenue versus 353 million for non-transaction.", "If you look at Market Intelligence, there as you know the majority of our revenue is subscription-based, so almost 90% is subscription-based versus non-subscription-based. And the same applies for Platts. It\u2019s almost 90% subscription versus 10% is non-subscription. Moving to the S&P Dow Jones Indices. There the subscription is approximately 20% of the overall revenue base. So in other words, it depends a bit segment by segment.", "Douglas Peterson", "Let me add though that in S&P Dow Jones Indices that about 60% of our revenue is AUM-based. We think \u2013 we don\u2019t think of that necessarily as subscription revenue and clearly it is subject to volumes and could be subject to changes in market levels as well as flows into and out of ETFs and funds. But that\u2019s also \u2013 AUM-based is different than transaction-based revenue. Once you\u2019ve locked in a contract, those contracts could go on for a long time. So even though that might be categorized as transaction revenue, we think of it \u2013 of its own category, AUM-based revenue.", "Hamzah Mazari", "That\u2019s very helpful. And then second question just on capital allocation philosophy, which you gave a lot of detail on. Is it fair to say that you do not mind not being investment-grade to do a larger deal and then bring leverage down 18 to 24 months, or do you have to be investment-grade even when doing a larger deal? Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Hamzah, the answer on your question is no. We would like to stay investment-grade as we have stated in the prepared remarks. We are today rated BBB+. We have given a specific range in terms of the adjusted leverage ratio of 1.75 to 2.25. We think where we are today is an efficient place to play within the overall leverage curve. So no, there is no intention with respect to going to below investment-grade as a company. On the contrary, we have made an explicit commitment in this capital philosophy to say we would like to remain investment-grade.", "What we have said is that it could be for a larger acquisition where we will use our balance sheet that we could increase our leverage to be higher than the 2.25 level for a certain period of time, but that we then would be committed to bring our self back into the range in a period of 18 to 24 months. That is usually an approach that is acceptable by the ratings agencies so you don\u2019t get penalized for that as long as you have that explicit commitment to bring yourself back into your range in the period of 18 to 24 months. So that particular situation should not create a situation that we would be downgraded to below investment-grade as a company.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Understood, very helpful. Thanks so much.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. You may ask your question.", "Alex Kramm", "Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to continue on the capital allocation here for a second. I guess a two-part question. One, if you look at the ASR that you just announced and you look at the cash on hand and the minimums that you want in the U.S., it seems like maybe you\u2019re raising a little bit of debt for that and you might be pushing up to the high end of the I guess leverage range. So maybe just talk about that.", "And then related to that, if you think about the 75% of I guess free cash flow that you want to return in dividends and share repurchases, is that a hard number? Meaning if you do a big deal, will you still be basically doing those buybacks or could you actually get rid of that buyback for a year or so for a big deal, or will you always return that cash in buybacks?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Good morning, Alex. Two excellent questions. The first question with respect to the ASR, indeed, if you look at the available cash at the end of the second quarter, we said there\u2019s 500 million of cash in the U.S. and 1.9 outside of the U.S. We\u2019re announcing an ASR of 500 million, but we don\u2019t need to add any leverage to do so.", "And the reason is, as you have seen, our free cash flow generation in the first half of this year was just over 600 million. We have a total free cash flow generation guidance for this year of 1.6 or more than 1.6, so we expect to generate over 1 billion of free cash flow in the second half of this year. So just the normal cash flow generation over the next period will be sufficient to keep us above the minimum U.S. cash balance. So in other words, there is not a need to add some leverage in order to fund this ASR of 500 million.", "With respect to your second question, we would say in normal course of business where we do tuck-in acquisitions, smaller inorganic deals, we believe that we should be able to do that with the 25% of free cash flow that has so far not been earmarked as return to shareholders. Plus we have some room between where we are today with respect to our leverage and the 2.25. So we have sufficient room to maneuver with respect to tuck-in or smaller, smaller deals.", "If we speak about larger transformational deals, as we have said, then we are willing to exceed the 2.25 range and bring ourselves back into that range over a period of 18 to 24 months. In that case, it could be that we need to move away from that 75% free cash flow return target. But then for a period of 18 to 24 months, we bring ourselves back in line with our leverage range.", "So I would say, normal course of business, 75% \u2013 at least 75% of free cash flow commitment to return to shareholders should be absolutely a commitment that we should be able to achieve. Only at very large kinds of deals where we exceed our leverage range, in that case there could be a possibility that for 18 to 24 months, we have to move away from this particular objective.", "Alex Kramm", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then second topic real quick on the Market Intelligence side. Now that you break out the components a little bit more, the risk services is something that I continue to look at. And I would say one thing. When you look at your primary competitor, that business continues to be much smaller than what they disclosed and there might be differences of course. But their growth rate also continues to outpace yours. So just wondering what you\u2019re doing there, if that\u2019s a big focus, if you could do anything better there because it seems like that should be an area of upside.", "Douglas Peterson", "It is an area of upside. Thank you for the question. We\u2019re putting a major focus on that area. We think that it fits well with what is the global landscape of a changing regulatory environment, the kind of risk environment that\u2019s out there as well as the intensity coming from regulators, from shareholders, et cetera, on looking at better tools for managing risk. Our business is substantially different. We have a very different business.", "We have a \u2013 our largest component of that business is the redistribution of Ratings intellectual property and we also have businesses that were developing models and risk metrics as well as some credit estimates, et cetera. We look at this as an area of growth. But from the point of view of a comparison to one of the competitors I assume you\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s a very, very different business mix.", "Alex Kramm", "All right, fair enough. Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may now ask you question.", "Mike Reid", "Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. I appreciate you taking the question. Do you believe there\u2019s any pull forward into the period in Ratings or there could be any more pull forward from 2018 into \u2013 possible into 2017?", "Douglas Peterson", "Thanks, Mike. Thanks for the question. There\u2019s always potentially some pull forward, but at the same time once issue \u2013 once an issue has been issued, the debt that\u2019s out there becomes outstanding debt. The closest proxy I could give you to a pull forward is discussed in our global refinancing study that was just issued. We looked at the total amount of debt which is outstanding that\u2019s going to be maturing in the next 5.5 years, between now and the end of 2022.", "The total amount has actually increased. It\u2019s gone up by about 3% since a year ago when we issued this study. The amount of debt which is maturing in 2018 has gone down a little bit, about 3%. So that\u2019s about as close as I could get to of what you could maybe categorize as pull-through or pull forward, which is \u2013 it\u2019s maybe there\u2019s a decrease a little bit in 2018 debt.", "Beyond that, we always see debt maturing depending on different schedules that come in place. We see people making refinancing decisions or new financing decisions based on what\u2019s happening in the markets. I don\u2019t want to go on too long, but let me just mention that our contention has always been that the two most important drivers to issuance are GDP growth. And then also, obviously issuance is driven by spreads.", "Spreads have been very attractive. The high-yield spreads were at 431 at the end of the second quarter. Our investment-grade is at 162. And both of those came down substantially from a year, year and a half ago when in high yield they\u2019re even as high 836 basis points is the spread. Anyway, so we look at this very carefully.", "We think that even if there was a pull forward, it gets \u2013 it remains in the system. It\u2019s debt that could always be refinanced again at some point. And the only indicator I\u2019ve got \u2013 and I would recommend that you speak with Chip if you want to look at that study on the global refinancing study. There\u2019s a slight decrease in maturities in 2018. That\u2019s about as close as I could get to a statistic that could see if there\u2019s any pull forward.", "Mike Reid", "Got it. And then just a quick one on the margins. On the Ratings business, without the incentive accrual, you said it would be up. Did you estimate how many basis points and what kind of expansion it would have been without the incentive accrual?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "We are not quantifying that but we can reconfirm that indeed excluding the change in incentive compensation, margins would have gone up in Ratings year-over-year.", "Chip Merritt", "As well as in the indices business, same thing applies. If we eliminate that year-over-year increase in incentive comp, that margins would have been up in indices year-over-year as well for the quarter.", "Mike Reid", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Huber of Huber Research. Sir, you may ask your question.", "Craig Huber", "Yes. My first question, for roughly last year and a half, you\u2019ve been moving away from subscription or non-transaction revenues within your Ratings business more to transaction-oriented and had some success with them. I\u2019m just kind of wondering how much more is left on that endeavor.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thanks, Craig. So we have been moving towards that. But the flipside is that we see a very critical part of our business model are those longer-run, long-term relationships. It\u2019s valuable for us to have an approach where some of our fees and transactions are coming in through more stable, long-term relationship approach. But we feel that we\u2019ve built excellent relationships with our customer base.", "We\u2019re showing how we can deliver long-term value to them. And that overall we think that the mix and the change of how we\u2019re going, we think that there \u2013 we could be achieving at some point a stability in the mix. But when it comes to what we deliver, it\u2019s critical that we show our customers the kind of value that we\u2019re creating, the kind of value that we\u2019re delivering.", "Craig Huber", "And also could you talk a little bit further about your outlook in the second half for both corporate finance as well as structured finance ratings, your outlook there for the second half of the year? Anything materially different we should be aware of in your mind?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes. So as you saw in the first half of the year, there was a lot of \u2013 there was some really big shifts in the mix. We do see pretty active pipelines for structured finance products given the rates, given the spreads. There\u2019s a lot of liquidity. You still have quantitative easing in Europe that is sucking up a lot of assets. So we see a strong pipeline for structured finance.", "Auto loans have slowed down a little bit. There have been some slowness there, but credit cards are picking up as well as CMBS activities. So on the structured side, on the traditional ABS side, we see strong pipeline, CMBS as well. RMBS, as you know, had a big uptick in the quarter but from such a tiny base that any uptick was going to look like a large percentage. We don\u2019t see in the long run a lot of activity in RMBS until there is a stronger approach to GSE reform.", "On the corporate and financial institutions side, corporates we\u2019ve seen less activity in the second \u2013 first and second quarter than we had seen last year. There is some interest in the U.S. in the \u2013 in a couple of sectors. Oil and gas, we\u2019ve seen some pickup there. Financial institutions are going to depend very importantly globally on capital rules and the shift to TLAC. In the long term, the banks are going to have to continue to increase their capital buffers.", "But there is a slight shift in the financial institutions market in the U.S. towards capital return. So as we see the large financial institutions here move towards capital return, that might temper somewhat issuance of the financial institution sector. Finally, on public finance, our outlook for public finance is pretty muted for the second half of the year. There is no major maturities that are coming up and we don\u2019t see any of the major jurisdictions running out and doing issuance.", "Craig Huber", "Sorry, high-yield and investment-grade, talk a little bit further about that, if you would, in the second half, your outlook there.", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes. For the \u2013 what we saw in the first half of the year in terms of investment-grade, investment-grade was down in the U.S. It was down in Europe. It was down in Asia. And high yield was also down in the U.S., but it was up pretty dramatically in Europe, over 20%. We\u2019re expecting that high yield will \u2013 if I look at \u2013 I don\u2019t necessarily have a good pipeline call on high yield, but if I look at the rates, rates are still very attractive.", "The base rate is attractive. Base rate is \u2013 even though it\u2019s up over a year ago at around 230, the 10-year yield, the spread is down over 150, 200 basis points, which means that the all-in cost on high yield is very attractive. So if I look at the rate scenario and I look at kind of the growth that\u2019s taking place in the economy, high yield could be an attractive area this year, but so far \u2013 I mean, the second half of the year. But so far this year, with the exception of Europe, high yield has not really been that strong.", "Chip Merritt", "Thanks, Craig.", "Craig Huber", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Craig. We will now take our final question from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, you may ask your question.", "William Warmington", "Good morning, everyone. So my question for you is on SNL and Capital IQ. What kind of reception are you getting from clients on the bundled enterprise pricing strategy? And are you seeing any competitive response from the other industry players?", "Douglas Peterson", "Well, first of all, let me mention that one of the things that we find has become very compelling about the business model and the combination of SNL and Cap IQ is it allows us to approach a very diverse set of users. We\u2019re able to provide value and bring very interesting analytics and data to financial institutions, to insurance companies, to regulators, to corporates. So we have a very wide group, buy side, sell side, et cetera.", "We also have a very different type of value proposition for different users. We have risk managers, portfolio managers, bankers, sales people, et cetera. And that kind of diversification across different types of users from a pure user point of view as well as different types of industries has given us the kind of growth that you\u2019ve seen.", "The reception to our new approach has been very positive. There are organizations which see a lot of value being delivered through our enterprise-wide pricing. We\u2019re still going through an approach to rolling that out. And very importantly, as we mentioned, we have a new Market Intelligence platform, which, during this quarter was previewed with our own internal users.", "And during the third quarter into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re going to be getting a beta version out to be delivering it early next year. We think that that will also allow us to see the full value of the integration of SNL and Cap IQ. But given the diversification of our client base, diversification of users, the value proposition that we\u2019re delivering, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress.", "William Warmington", "Okay. And then for my second question, just wanted to ask about index M&A opportunities. It seems you\u2019ve got a nice mega trend there with the move to passive, really strong margins. It seems like if you could find something, the cost synergies would be significant. Are there opportunities out there in the index field?", "Douglas Peterson", "Let me take that. There are a few here and there. Obviously, you should assume that if there\u2019s something out there, we\u2019re looking at it. And we gave you some of the themes that we would be interested in looking at or adding to our value, whether it\u2019s fixed income, it\u2019s ESG, it has to do with global expansion. So those are the types of themes that we\u2019d be interested in adding to our portfolio.", "William Warmington", "Got it. Well, thank you very much.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thanks, Bill.", "Chip Merritt", "Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have three more questions on queue. And the next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Sir, you may ask your question.", "Stephen Sheldon", "Hi. It\u2019s Stephen Sheldon on for Tim this morning. Thanks for taking our questions. First, for Platts, you talked about low single-digit growth in the subscription portion. Can you provide some color on what trends you\u2019re seeing recently within subscriptions and the impact that prior contract renewals may be having?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes. Stephen, this is Doug. On Platts, we feel like our 4% growth has actually been good compared to the underlying market dynamics. As you know, the price of oil has been generally low, a lot lower than what people had originally forecast a few years ago, settling right now around $50 a barrel for Brent. We think that compared to what we\u2019ve seen in some of our competitors and other parts of the information market, 4% growth has been good. It\u2019s a combination of new penetration as well as what you\u2019ve seen with renewals.", "We do obviously always understand that when we provide \u2013 when we go into renewal discussions that our customers are going through sometimes tough times and they need to look at how they\u2019re going to manage their costs effectively. And so we have a value proposition that we deliver. We work with our customers very carefully to ensure that they understand that value proposition, provide potentially new products and services, new approach to pricing. But those discussions and negotiations have been going quite well and that\u2019s also reflected in the growth rates that we showed today.", "Stephen Sheldon", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess second within indices, the expense base has been a little volatile over the last few quarters. And you talked some about the impact of incentive accruals this quarter. But can you talk about how we should think about that expense base as we look into the second half of the year? Thanks.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "If we look at the expense base of indices compared to a year ago, there are a couple of elements that drive the difference. First of all, this year we have the inclusion of Trucost. You know that we did that acquisition of Trucost last year, so that is an addition that you have to take into account. Secondly, there is that difference in incentive compensation, which we believe is a timing matter and should self-correct in the second half of this year.", "And then thirdly, as you will recall, last year \u2013 in the second half of last year, we added a third data center, so that is a step-up cost that is not in the comparable period in 2016. So again, in the second half of this year, there should not be a difference anymore because that is a onetime step-up cost and that will be in the same period on a comparable basis. So those are the main differences year-over-year. If you look at the business-as-usual expenses, those are going up at a relatively low percentage. So that is what you should normally expect going forward again from the indices expense base.", "Stephen Sheldon", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Sir, you may ask your questions.", "Henry Chien", "Good morning. Thanks for squeezing us in. It\u2019s Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just a question on the Market Intelligence. The really strong growth in enterprise and desktop, I was wondering if you could share just some color on what\u2019s driving that, whether it\u2019s any improvement in your end markets or clients or anything internally that you\u2019re doing or new sales or any sort of color to understand the trend there. Thanks.", "Douglas Peterson", "Good morning, Henry. It\u2019s a combination of factors. I touched on a couple of them before. It\u2019s the diversification of our user base. It\u2019s also the ongoing shift to a pricing model which provides an enterprise-wide view. The enterprise-wide view allows us to have a much wider user base as opposed to a per-seat type of a pricing model. And through that, we can determine and show the kind of value that we\u2019re delivering. And organizations understand the kind of value we\u2019re delivering. So we feel that it\u2019s a combination of all of those factors and we\u2019re pleased with the progress and look forward to reporting more as we go through the rest of the year.", "Henry Chien", "Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And really appreciate the capital allocation framework. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the transformative or larger acquisitions. I was wondering if you can share any thoughts on what kind of situation that would likely be or any thoughts of what would \u2013 what kind of criteria would lead to a transformative or a very large acquisition? Thanks.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Henry, good morning. This is Ewout. Obviously, I cannot speculate on a scenario like that. But what you should see in terms of essence of our capital philosophy is the following. On the one hand, very significant commitment to returning capital to our shareholders from our ongoing free cash flow generation, so at least 75%. It could be more if we don\u2019t need the remaining 25% for certain growth opportunities.", "But then to have a prudent balance sheet and a balance sheet that has flexibility in case of a large transformation kind of M&A situation. But of course, we are not predicting that. That is just a prudent balance sheet we think is the right approach for the company. So we have tried to strike a balance in our management \u2013 capital management philosophy, and I think that\u2019s the key takeaway you should see from what we have presented to you today.", "Henry Chien", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thanks, Henry.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now take our final question from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Sir, you may ask your question.", "Vincent Hung", "Hi. Just on leverage again. If you were to do an acquisition, how far could you go beyond 2.25x?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Well, I\u2019m not going to provide you with a specific number on that, Vincent, as you understand. But I think you can understand if we speak about 18 to 24 months of cash generation, the commitment of dividends that we will, of course, not back away from, how much of that in cash is available to bring ourselves back into that leverage range and how much that would mean. So I think you have all the components to calculate that particular number.", "Vincent Hung", "Okay. And just lastly, you\u2019ve called out data feeds as a strong driver of growth in recent quarters. Could you just give us some color here on the drivers of demand, the new customers? And how much of that is kind of pricing?", "Douglas Peterson", "Can you repeat the question? In which particular area --", "Chip Merritt", "Data feeds in Market Intelligence. He\u2019s asking why data feeds in Market Intelligence had been strong, new clients and that sort of thing.", "Douglas Peterson", "I don\u2019t have the numbers to give you. I\u2019d ask you to go back to Chip later to see if we can get you any further details on it. But I can tell you from the point of view of what\u2019s attractive about the data feeds, it\u2019s that there\u2019s definitely a move across our broader customer base towards more automated tools, towards ways to build systems that take advantage of direct data feeds into systems. So think about it as machine-to-machine delivery, where we can provide data feeds that go right into other systems.", "It\u2019s an area that is growing. We think that it\u2019s an area that the kind of added value that we bring, it\u2019s beyond just \u2013 one of the reasons data feeds \u2013 I think the better word is it\u2019s highly value-added data that we\u2019re feeding. It\u2019s not raw data. It\u2019s not commoditized data. The kinds of things that we\u2019re providing bring a lot of value that get embedded in the workflow. And data feeds are actually a really, really critical part of our business model because the more things get embedded, the more sticky they become.", "Chip Merritt", "And one other thing I\u2019d like to add is that SNL, with all the fabulous capabilities they had, they didn\u2019t have a data feed business. So we mentioned earlier in the call, in the brief prepared remarks, we\u2019re just now beginning to launch some of SNL\u2019s capabilities through our data feeds business within Market Intelligence, which is kind of exciting for our customers.", "Vincent Hung", "Thanks.", "Douglas Peterson", "Well, thank you very much. Let me just close with a couple of comments. First of all, thank you everyone for joining the call and for all of your questions. We\u2019re very pleased with our strong start to the year, but clearly there\u2019s more to do. We look forward to delivering on our growth in innovation and growth in excellent commitments. We obviously want to continue to drive forwards on productivity and continuous improvement initiatives.", "And I\u2019m very pleased that Ewout has been able to put in place a capital allocation framework and we will see during the year how we\u2019re going to be talking to you more about that capital allocation framework when it\u2019s live. So we look forward to seeing you next quarter.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning\u2019s call. A PDF version of the presented slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. A replay of this call, including the Q&A session, will be available in about two hours.

I'd like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. All participants are in a listen-only mode. We will open the conference to questions-and-answers after the presentation, and instructions will follow at that time. To access the webcast and slides, go to investor.spglobal.com, that is investor.spglobal.com and click on the link for the quarterly earnings webcast [Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.", "Chip Merritt", "Thank you and good morning. And welcome to S&P Global's earnings call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our third quarter 2017 results. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they could be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com.", "In today's earnings release and during the conference call, we're providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation's operating performance between periods and to view the corporation's business from the same perspective as managements. The earnings release contains Exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.", "Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in the teleconference may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates, and descriptions of future events.

Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Douglas Peterson", "Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome everyone to the call today. Consistent with the first half of the year, the company delivered another solid quarter. The underlying environment for business is unfavorable with global GDP growth in every geography, higher and stable commodity prices, strong equity markets and modest growth in US bond issuance. With this backdrop, S&P Global is doing well.", "Let me begin with the third quarter highlights. We attained strong organic revenue and adjusted operating profit in every segment. We delivered 190 basis points of adjusted profit margin improvement and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 19%. As a result of our year-to-date performance, our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of 6.55 to 6.70.", "We will complete our $500 million ASR agreement and believe that reinvesting in our stock represents a great investment and a good use of our cash. We returned $604 million through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.2 billion. We continue to focus on delivering meaningful revenue growth, launching new products, investing in productivity and returning capital to shareholders.", "Looking more closely at the financial results, the company reported 5% revenue growth and achieved 12% on an organic basis. The company achieved 190 basis points improvement in adjusted operating profit margin due to strong organic revenue growth, the sale of lower margin businesses, and productivity initiatives. We delivered 19% adjusted diluted EPS growth. There was some puts and takes to these figures, recorded $0.03 a share unfavorable impact for ForEx and $0.14 a share favorable impact from stock option exercises, both of which Ewout will discuss in a moment.", "What I would like to do first is, provide a bit more color on some of the current and future drivers of our businesses. Let me start with bank loan ratings, which has been a growing part of the ratings business over the past few years. Bank loan ratings are primarily issued on leveraged loans typically rated BB+ or lower. Over the past few years both the volume of leveraged loans and the percent of leveraged loans rated by S&P have increased.", "During the quarter bank loan revenue of $83 million was a key factor in the revenue growth of the rating segment. This chart shows the US leveraged loan inventory with each part depicting leveraged loans maturing in the next eight years as of the end of each period. At the end of 2014 for example, $809 billion was going to mature in the following years. At the end of 2015 850 billion was going to mature in the next eight years and so on. The total amount of outstanding leveraged loans has increased each other at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% since 2011.", "When tracking issuance data, we always try to point out to where issuance takes place, which type of issuance and the size of the deals make a difference in the revenue we realize. Global issuance in the third quarter excluding sovereign debt decreased slightly. Structured finance sovereign was quite strong. Geographically issuance in the US increased 5% in the third quarter with investment-grade increasing 9%, high-yield increasing 1%, public finance down 19% and structured finance increasing 26% due primarily to the strength in CLOs and CMBS.", "In Europe, issuance decreased 17% in the quarter with investment-grade declining 22%, high-yield decreasing 29% and structured finance increasing 13%, with strength in CLOs and RMBS. In Asia, issuance increased 4%. The vast majority of Asian issuance however is made up of local China debt that we don't rate.", "Ratings recently published its final issuance forecast for 2017 combined with its initial 2018 forecast. This forecast provides a range of issuance estimates for each of the major issuance categories. For 2017, excluding international public finance which is not material to our results. We expect a medium increase of approximately 2% in 2017 and approximately 1% in 2018 in overall issuance, where both financial services and structured finance are forecasted to increase in both years, U.S. public finance is forecasted to decline in both years.", "Our cautious outlook is primarily due to the expectation that most developed countries' central banks will begin to bring in a monetary stimulus and non-financial monetary programs. And many financial markets have reached new heights in low volatility and it has become more likely that in 2018 market volatility will increase.", "Here is a new chart that shows how U.S. investment-grade corporations utilize bond proceeds. Issuance for M&A, buybacks and refinancing depicted in the bottom three colors of each bar has increased considerably in recent years. There has been a material raise in debt financed M&A and share buybacks since 2013 as investors have become more comfortable with blockbuster offers. Note that of the largest 40 deals ever printed nearly all had been transacted since 2013 for M&A or buybacks.", "Results in our investment-grade financial sector issuance, which can make up as much as half of total issuance is included in the general corporate purpose category. If we take a look at U.S. high-yield issuance over the same timeframe, we see that the high-yield issuance is much more heavily dependent on refinancing needs than the investment grade market. High-yield borrower's general issuance bonds to maturing debt are for specific M&A or recapitalization efforts.", "Finally providing let me share some of the progress we have made with our Green Evaluations. Propelled by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, and the impetus it created to finance $1 trillion a year in investments for renewable energy and other initiatives to limit global warming, Green investment is on a firm upward trajectory. S&P Global Ratings launched its Green Evaluations in April and it includes evaluations of buildings, transport, energy efficiency, water, traditional power plants and nuclear. We are encouraged by the acceptance of our Green Evaluations in the market.", "This slide includes some of the global bonds we have evaluated today, such as the Mexico Airport Trust and the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority subordinated revenue bond. Within Market Intelligence, we continue to extend our capabilities of our offering during the quarter. First, we launched RatingsDirect monitor, which features real time, visually interactive in intuitive ways for end users to receive information that is relevant to the company's investment and counterparty portfolio.", "Second is an expansion of SNL data available via Data Feed. Historically, SNL is a very small data feed business. Earlier this year we began adding certain SNL data sets to Xpressfeed, our data feed management system. During the third quarter, we rolled out new alternative and unstructured data sets through Xpressfeed such as the regulatory data, bank branch data, real estate property data and corporate transcripts. This should prove valuable to investor seeking new sources of alternative data that can help uncover relationships and new alpha generating ideas.", "Third is enhanced credit analytics workflow, which facilitates counterparty analysis and integration of SNL data. It also expands model coverage to include loss given default for Europe and the Middle-East as well as relative contribution analysis and 30 years term structures.", "Turning to Platts, we often share new product launches, but today I want to share with you progress made on a launch from a few years ago. In the past, we have discussed the increasingly important role that LNG will play in unifying global natural gas market. Platts, Japan, Korea Marker is the LNG benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargos delivered into Japan and South Korea. As these countries take the largest share of LNG imports in the world, Platts JKM has become a key reference price for the physical shipment, and as often the case when a physical market develops, market participants want to be able to hedge their position.", "This chart shows the surge in monthly JKM swap volumes on ICE. Volume depicted here represents a total amount of trading activity or contracts that have changed hands during the month. Open interest is the total number of outstanding contracts that are held by market participants.", "Next, I'd like to share with you several new products in S&P Dow Jones Indices. The first is the launch of the S&P/BMV IPC VIX Index in conjunction with the Mexican stock exchange. This index utilizes the same methodology as the CBOE Volatility Index. Second is the launch of the corporate carbon pricing tool, which helps companies assess exposure to regional carbon pricing mechanism. The tool combines the company's greenhouse gas emissions and financial performance data with Trucost regional carbon pricing information to provide insights on carbon pricing risk after 2030.", "Trucost has accumulated a global database of current carbon regulation, emissions trading schemes, fuel taxes and potential featured carbon pricing scenarios designed to achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2\u00b0 centigrade or less.", "Third, Transamerica Asset Management has launched four new strategic beta ETFs designed to provide core equity strategies with an embedded risk management feature called the DeltaShares by Transamerica suite, the new ETFs first attract the S&P Managed Risk 2.0 index series, which offers exposure to a given segment of the equity market while seeking to control volatility. Even though ETFs were only launched in July two of them have market caps that are among the top 10 of the new ETF launches this year.", "And fourth is a strategic investment in Algomi. Algomi is an innovative fintech company that has created a bond information network that enables buy side and sell side firms, as well as exchanges, to harness data to improve financial trading decisions allowing for greater transparency and artificial intelligence-powered trade facilitation.", "With that color, let me turn the call over to Ewout who will provide more specifics on our business results during the quarter. Ewout?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I would like to discuss the third quarter results and then provide specifics on our increased 2017 guidance.", "Doug already discussed the 12% growth in organic revenue and a 19% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. I'd like to touch on a few other line items. First, I would like to point the $12 million increase in adjusted unallocated expense in two perspectives. About one-third was due to due to a company-wide IT project to replace our order to cash system. About one-third was for professional service fees, encouraged to identify additional growth and productivity opportunities. We believe that this will be the big quarter for spending on both of these initiatives. The final one-third was for performance related incentive compensation.", "Second, the adjusted effective tax rate of 27.9% improved primarily due to the discrete tax benefit on stock option exercises which I will review in a moment. And third, our ongoing share repurchase program coupled with our recent ASR led to a 7.4 million decrease or 3% decline in average diluted shares outstanding.", "During our fourth quarter of 2016 earnings call, we noted a recent FASB guidance change for accounting of stock payments to employees which we estimated at the time would increase 2017 EPS by $0.10 to $0.15 depending on SPGI's share price and option exercise activity. This change also impacts EPS whenever the fair market value of employee stock grants exceeds the grant price. The impact is recorded as a reduction in tax expense.", "Due to exceptionally high levels of option exercises, during the third quarter from private and recently retired employees we recorded a reduction in tax expenses that improved third quarter adjusted EPS by $0.14. It is difficult to estimate the impact in future quarters, but let me make two observations that should be helpful.", "First, the company no longer grants stock options and at the end of the third quarter there were 2.1 million employee stock options outstanding. When the stock options are exercised assuming that they are still in the money there would be a tax benefit. Second, the company continues to grant restrictive stock. Each year in the fourth quarter an average range of restrictive stock units will pass and provide a tax benefit whenever the fair market value of the stock exceeds the grant's price.", "For the fourth quarter of 2017, if we assume more stock options are exercised and the stock remains at today's stock price, we estimate that we will record a tax benefit of approximately $0.07 in the fourth quarter associated with restrictive stock. This amount is included in our updated guidance.", "Net of hedges, foreign exchange rates, had $4 million positive impact on the company's revenue and $12 million negative impact on adjusted operating profit or about $0.03 per share in the third quarter. The bulk of the impact was in the ratings segment. Ratings adjusted operating profit was primarily impacted by the Australian dollar and British pound. Taken together, the quarter included a $0.14 gain in stock option exercises, a $0.03 loss from FOREX and adjusted unallocated expenses that were much higher than our annual run rate.", "Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pre-tax adjustments to earnings totaled to a loss of $19 million in the quarter and included restructuring actions in Ratings and Corporate. We anticipate that these restructuring actions will result an annual savings of approximately $30 million. Despite strong year-to-date results we are continuously looking for opportunities to transition to lean our more effective organizations. In addition, we excluded $24 million in due related amortization expense.", "In the third quarter, led by Ratings every business segment contributed to gain organic revenue. The reported revenue decline in market and commodities intelligence was due to several divestitures. Each business segment reported adjusted operating profit growth, market and commodities intelligence reported a 1% gain in adjusted operating profit as organic growth and synergies more than made up for the lost profitability associated with the divestitures. I'm pleased with the adjusted operating margin improvement in Ratings and market and commodities intelligence.", "Well I'll just discuss Indices margins in more detail in a moment, let me just say that we want to invest intelligently in such a high margin business, while simultaneously maintaining a disciplined cost structure. Let me now turn to the individual segments' performance. I will start with Ratings.", "Ratings revenue increased 15% or 14% excluding a favorable impact from FOREX. Adjusted operating profit increased 19%, while the adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 53%. As we have said in the past, we managed our Ratings business on a rolling four quarters basis, and you can see on that basis the adjusted operating margin increased 270 basis points.", "Both transaction and non-transaction revenue recorded strong growth. Non-transaction revenue increased to 7% due primarily to growth in fees associated with surveillance, entity ratings and short-term debts including commercial paper. Transaction revenue increased 24% primarily from gains, U.S. corporate bonds, global structured products and European bank loans.", "If you look at the Ratings' revenue by its various markets, you can see the greatest gains were in corporates and structured finance. Bank loan ratings are part of corporates and boosted results in this market. Structured finance increased primarily due to strong CLO activity in both the U.S. and Europe as well as increased CMBS activity in the U.S. The only market that declined was governments due to the 19% decline in U.S. public finance issuance that Doug mentioned.", "Let me now turn to market and commodities intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global market intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the quarter, the third quarter, reported revenue declined 6% due to divestitures. Excluding divestiture and acquisition activity, organic revenue increased 7%. Despite the loss of earnings associated with divestitures, adjusted operating profit improved 1% due to organic growth and synergies realization. Adjusted operating margin improved 270 basis points primarily due to strong organic revenue growth, the sale of lower margin businesses and SNL integration synergies.", "Turning to Market Intelligence, excluding recent divestitures organic revenue grew 8%. There are three primary reasons behind this growth. First, we serve a diverse set of segments beyond Wall Street, including corporations, banks, insurance, professional service firms and others. Several of these have better underlying growth characteristics than investment banks and investment management. Second, we serve all of those segments from the largest to smaller companies and grow our contract values as our clients grow.", "Third, our renewal rates and sales performance are strong as we enhance the product, train customers and leverage our unique and proprietary conduct. One area greatest growth can be seen is in the number of SNL, S&P Capital IQ and risk surfaces desktop users, which expanded 13% year-over-year. Emphasis continues to be on instituting enterprise-wide commercial agreements and combining desktop platforms, approximately one-third of RatingsDirect and Capital IQ desktop business has been conferred to enterprise-wide commercial agreements.", "With respect to combining desktop platforms, two events will occur in early November. First, we will launch a product of the new Market Intelligence desktop for all SNL customers. This will have an updated look and feel, will contain all SNL content and the new Capital IQ content and functionality. Second, we will launch an official beta release of the new combined platform for investment banking customers after just completing a successful preview campaign with selective users.", "Looking more deeply at Market Intelligence revenue, all three components delivered a strong organic revenue growth. Desktop products grew 8%, enterprise solutions had been renamed data management solutions and revenue increased 9% leading growth of Market Intelligence. This surface has grown 5% with Ratings Xpress and RatingsDirect providing high and mid-single digits respectively. And finally note that about $37 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2016 from businesses that were divested.", "Turning to Platts, organic revenue growth fixed higher, up to 4% growth in the first half of the year, Platts delivered 6% organic revenue growth in the third quarter. This growth was due to the poor subscription business which grew mid-single digits and Global Ratings services revenue which increased by more than 20%. The effective trading was strong at the intercontinental exchange in oil and at the Singapore exchange with iron ore.", "If you look at Platts revenue by its four primary markets, you can see that petroleum and power and gas makeup the majority of the business. Platts growth this quarter came primarily from petroleum which benefited from solids of subscription growth and strong global trading activity. In addition petrochemicals contributed 6% growth and metals and agriculture returned to growth with a strong recovery in global trading services revenues. Please note that there was $9 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2017 from the PIRA acquisition.", "Let me now turn to Indices. Revenue increased 14% mostly due to continued growth in ETF assets under management. Adjusted operating profit increased 10%, adjusted operating margin decreased 190 basis points to 64.3%, as revenue gains were partially offset by increased expenses related to performance driven costs and investments. Performance driven costs includes sales royalties paid to our partners, sales commissions and incentives. And investments include true cost expenses, expansions in India and Mexico and technology.", "Asset-liked fees, which are principally derived from ETFs, mutual funds and certain OTC derivatives experienced greatest growth in the third quarter rising 17%, driven by 31% increase in average ETF AUM. Subscription revenue increased 6%, due to growth in data subscriptions and custom indices. Exchange rate of derivative revenue rose 6%, with gains in S&P 500 Index options and fixed futures and options activity.", "The trends of assets moving into passive investments was again very strong in the third quarter, with the exchange traded products industry reaching net inflows of $124 billion. The quarter ending ETF AUM guide to our indices totaled $1.214 trillion, up 33% versus the third quarter of 2016. As the chart shows this was the result of $150 billion of net inflows and $150 billion of market appreciation over the last 12 months. The $1.214 Trillion was a new record.", "The third quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 31% year-over-year and this is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter-end figures. Exchange rate of the derivatives volume most mixed. Key contracts include increased S&P 500 index options and fixed futures and options activities which experienced robust activity and a decline in activity at the CME equity complex.", "Now, turning to our capital position, there was little change from the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. We now have $2.3 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of long term debt. $2.1 billion of this cash was held outside the United States at the end of the third quarter. Our debt coverage as measured by adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA was 2.0 times versus 2.1 times at the end of 2016. Year-to-date free cash flow was $1.1 billion dollars of which nearly 500 million was generated during the third quarter.", "As for return of the capital, the company returned $604 million to shareholders in the third quarter, $500 million through an accelerated share repurchase program with 2.8 million shares received in the third quarter and additional shares expected when the program is completed at the end of October and 104 million in dividends.", "Now, I will review our updated 2017 guidance. Based upon strong year-to-date results and our expectation for the remainder of 2017, we have made several changes to our 2017 guidance. This slide epics our GAAP guidance and the changes that we have made. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates.", "This slide shows our updated adjusted guidance. The changes are highlighted on this slide. I'm going to discuss the changes to our adjusted guidance which were as follows. We have increased our organic revenue growth from high single-digit to low double-digit growth, with contributions by every business segment.", "We have increased our unallocated expense from a range of $130 million to $135 million to a range of $135 million to $140million, driven by continued IT spend and higher incentive compensation. We have increased our operating profit margin guidance from a range of 45% to 46% to a range of 46% to 47%.", "We have lowered interest expense by $5 million to $145 million and we have increased diluted EPS, which excludes deal-related amortization from a prior range of $6.15 to $6.30 to a new range of $6.55 to $6.70. Overall, this guidance reflects our expectation that 2017 will be a very strong year for the company.", "With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.", "Chip Merritt", "Thanks, Ewout. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants, please press Star 1 to indicate that you wish to enter the queue to ask a question. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press Star 2. I would kindly ask that you limit yourself to two questions; that's two questions, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session.", "If you've been listening through a speaker phone, but would like to now ask a question, we ask that you lift your handset prior to pressing Star 1 and remain on the handset until your question has been answered. This will ensure better sound quality.", "Operator, we'll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Peter Appert", "Thank you. Good morning. So Dough the performance on margin perspective continues to be exceptional and then you've addressed this before, but I'm required to ask you again, your confidence and the ability to continue to sustain the currency margin improvement you have seen, how much more upside is there how is been used up already.", "Douglas Peterson", "Peter thanks for the question, good morning. We continue to be committed to improving our margins and at the same we are investing the businesses we think that obviously one of the best indicators of improving our margins is to keep growing the top line. We have invested in however approaching commercial markets, we put in place commercial heads of all of our businesses we are working towards looking at the best ways to penetrate markets and then improve our top line growth, but at the same time we are also committed to managing our expenses in a way that are professional as well as appropriate for our business growth. So we continue to be believe that we can improve our margins, we have thought about a lot about this and it's something that we think that we can still do.", "Peter Appert", "Alright, thank you and with that I am just wondering if you have got any - if there has been any evaluation in your thought process in terms of appropriate level of leverage on the balance sheet.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Good morning, Peter. If you have heard us speaking last quarter with respect to our capital philosophy and targets, that is a new frame work we have set out to you our investors that hopefully provides clear guidance on our expectation with respect to capital return. Our balance sheet, share buy backs, our dividends and also leverage expectations for the future. What we have said is that we want to be investment great overall and that our adjusted growth leverage should be in the range of 1.75 to 2.25 versus our adjusted EBITDA. This quarter we are at 2.0 so just at the midpoint of the range and therefore a very comfortable where we are with respect to leverage at this point in time.", "Peter Appert", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. You may now ask you question.", "Joseph Foresi", "Hi, so you are obviously having a fairly good year here. How do you think about the long-term growth rates and margin profile for the overall business?", "Douglas Peterson", "Joseph, thank you for that, this is Dough let me just give you a couple of quick thoughts about that. As I just mentioned to Peter, we continue to look at top line growth as the best way to drive our margin improvements and we don't have necessarily projections for each segment, but our guidance is adjusted. Operating margins about 46% to 47% that you just saw in the slide that Ewout presented. In the ratings business over the long run we inspired to the low 50% range. We are continuing to look at how we can drive productivities through investments in IT, but maintain our quality, our controls and our analytical excellence in the market in commodities space we've got a high 30% margin over the next couple of years. We are continuing to complete the synergy program as well as the other approach to commercial discipline in IT investments as in ratings. And then in index, we don't really have a specific target in the index business. AUM levels and derivative activities in some ways are out of our control, but we are continuing to invest in the business and due target - in the extent we have it targeted. It's maintaining in the same kind of a range, but we are not giving a specific target for the index business.", "Joseph Foresi", "Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question, any thoughts on the new tax reform that's out there and how could impact the business going forward? Thanks.", "Douglas Peterson", "There is a couple of things on the tax reform. Obviously if the overall tax rate is reduced that would - we will be a beneficiary of a lower rate. We have been able to have a few benefits here and there and we're in this 30% range we used to be at the more of the 31% and 32% range. But if the corporate tax rate went down to 20%, we will have a very positive impact. There is other provisions which have been mentioned in the past like non-deductablity of interest expense, we have look at that carefully, we see what that might do to the debt markets. We think that there could be some potential impact to debt markets from that, but at the same time debt is the most important capital market in the United States and it's a way the corporations finance themselves and provide more leverage and better returns to their shareholders. But these are still - most of this specific details of the tax reform are really not known yet and as they become known we are going to be looking those, but based on what we know now, net-net we would probably get some benefits from the tax reform based on the provisions that we have seen.", "Joseph Foresi", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Conor Fitzgerald from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Conor Fitzgerald", "Good morning. I want to ask a question on the treasury white paper particularly some of the comments around the pricing ForEx data feeds. I know the comment doesn't really specifically apply to your business, but you can see there's perhaps some prolog events just fit on data business, but pricing power. Does the white paper change, I think of our pricing power in this part of your business at all?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Good morning, Conor. This is Ewout. Of course we have taken notice of that report and overall our expectation that those particular professions or proposals should not impact the S&P global. As you would see it's very much in between data providers of equity markets and broker dealers and the charge of data feeds from the equity markets. We are facilitating some of those through our platforms, but the end those are direct to relationships in terms of intellectual property between the exchangers and the broker dealers. So overall, we don't believe that will have an impact on the companies and therefore we are very comfortable that the company will have similar growth expectations in the future not impacted by this report.", "Conor Fitzgerald", "That's helpful, thank you. And then just another one on taxes, if there was a lower tax rate on foreign cash repetition how would you think about potentially utilizing that?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Yeah, at this point in time, our foreign cash is focused on permanent reinvestments overseas. So that is the starting point. We might reconsider those plans when there is a change in tax profession and that could be repatriation, but we need to discuss at that point in time when we have the tax. So it might be that we reconsider our permanents reinvestments, plans we have today, but we need to see what will come out of the new tax regulation and we need to decide at that point in time.", "Conor Fitzgerald", "Very helpful, thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Miss. Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Toni Kaplan", "Thank you. Good morning. In light of the outside strength in transactional ratings revenue this quarter, can just give us some additional color on pricing and share gains. It is seen like based on the issuance levels that we had seen that this was a real out performance.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Good morning Tony. Let me just give you a little bit of color on the performance overall clearly this was not such a great quarter when it comes to issuance the global issuance was down almost 7% overall, but as usual there is a mix balance that we always look out to see where there might be sources of strength for the type of performance we had on the top line. In U.S. the corporate were up about 6.5% the financial services were up 9%. You know the public finance is down about 19%, but a combination of the corporate to financial services what we saw overall with some strength in the public and the - the structured finance area, there was a CMBS strength, it was up as 46% for the quarter as well as structured credit which was mostly CLOs that was up over a 100%. So truly the mix of what we saw that we benefited from and then as you know this quarter we had the first slide we showed you was bank loan ratings because that's been a very positive story for the market overall. The bank loan market has been strong through a combination of banks activities with their own balance sheets and then securitizations to go eventually sometimes into the CLO market. And it's a combination of all of that that is driven our top line growth.", "Toni Kaplan", "Great and then in the slides, it showed that the desk top users from market intelligence to desk top users were up 13%, but that desk top revenue itself was only up about 8. So could you give us a sense of what the divergence is there is it customer mix and if you could give any color on desk top client base like sell side versus buy side, banking versus research or other functions anything that you can provide there is very helpful. Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "Tony, let me take the first part of that question. On the first part of the question as you know we are slowly moving towards changing our contracts with customers to an enterprise wide contract which means that you have agreement with your organization and they can bring on its many users as possible. So as we move more, more of our contracts enterprise wide that means that there are - you open up the ability for anybody in that has approached using a license to use products and services so that's where you see the number of desk tops increasing and it's a good leading indicator for us in the future where we are going to be. We are negotiating contracts overtime as the usage goes up its gives us the ability to think about how we can get pricing increases over time on that. And Chip has some more numbers specifically about the different segments of who the users are.", "Chip Merritt", "Yeah, I don't know the very exact numbers, but a few quarters ago in our slide that we gave you a price chart which shows you the break down market intelligence cost by - customers and was roughly pretty evenly split between four categories. One of the categories that people don't think about a lot is corporates and others. So you know the corporate and accounting firms and consulting firms [indiscernible] those folks may buy not look at this specifically, but those kind of firms. Then that chunk with sell side, a chunk with buy side, a chunk within private equity. So please go look at that chart may, might exact figures, but take pick up that chart.", "Toni Kaplan", "Thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. You may ask your question.", "Alex Kramm", "Good morning. Just staying on that market intelligence topic for a second and I heard the one third no enterprise pricing and I know there was no other question what market data cost in general. When we talk to clients some of those move to enterprise pricing, it seems to be driving decent cost increases into the tune of like double digits or so. So just wondering at what point you are reaching the limit or you still feel like you got good upside. I guess what we are hearing is that folks increasingly are looking at the cost with you guys and wondering if it is getting ended a bit too much though. Any comments will be appreciated.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Good morning Alex. This is Ewout. So we are very encouraged by the trends of moving to enterprise wide contracts. As you know that is an exclusive strategy of markets intelligence and we think that's good for the customers and good for S&P global. So let me give you a little bit of more color around that about one third of the previous capital like few customers are now come forwarded the plan in ultimately to continue to bring the whole customer set to enterprise wide contracts and we believe that's a good developments because it ultimately - it means that when one of our customers is adding new employees, new analysts they can all be added to the platform without any additional costs. And, still it will increase usage, it will increase embedding into the models, we like to see that number of 13% increase in usage, we think ultimately more users is always a positive in the long term.", "So, overall this is an explicit strategy, we believe we provide value for the platform, we look as you know from the enterprise wide conflicts very much to actually usage, and we try to make an estimate of the edit value for the customers. How much that's embedded into the work close. So, there's a difference between a customer that is looking at a more high-level data sources, others that go in very deep prefatory intelligence and therefore there are some difference changes in terms of the price setting. But overall, we believe that the product is well priced, is competitive in the market, is heading functionality and that is the main drive behind the growth in users and the best of revenue.", "Alex Kramm", "Alright fair enough, and then just maybe, since somebody mentioned that treasury report earlier, I think one of the areas that didn't get lot of attention was, I guess, treasuries push for more securitization. So, Doug may be for you, I mean, any conversations you had to that regard with the administration and obviously structure plan as markets haven't been that robust last two years. Anything that could do, or time lines you would think about here, if officially pushed to get that going again?", "Douglas Peterson", "Well that the two aspects, the first in the US that's clearly interested in Washington and I have no idea what the term could be for GST reform, which might eventually change the dynamic of the R&BS market. The R&BS market in the US is gotten to be quite small, but in the last quarter, there was less the $12 billion of issuance of R&BS securities. So, there might be at some point, some reform there, but I'm not going to hold my breath for it. In Europe you know that Mario Draghi has spoken many times about wanting to revitalize the securitization market in Europe and they do think, to be some progresses, see more structured credits, this quarter they were $14.2 billion worth of CLO's and other type of structured credits. And we do see some interest in Europe to have a more robust securitization market, particularly because, it frees up capital on corporate and thinking down sheets, so that they can be re-invested in other type of activities and as well as provides more inventory for the securities markets and moves away from more terminal and banking market. So, I've had a lot of discussions with this with different central bankers and policy makers, but, there is no specific plans innovate that I've seen. And in the US the biggest market could get at least, if you saw the R&BS market, opening up again, but I don't see any timeline for that.", "Alex Kramm", "Okay, very good thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Research, you may ask your question.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Good morning, thank you. I was hoping you could address, how investors should think about your business, and any Nett benefits post Midrid 2, is that something you guys benefit from? Historically you haven't talked a lot of that, some of your peers have, so just curious there first?", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you, Hamzah. Well first of all, when it comes to Midrid 2, we are obviously looking very carefully at this, there are sort of different in's and out's from this, and there is a lot of new discussions about this today related to how the US players are going to be able to deliver intelligence and research into the European market. So, first of all from our point of view, a direct point of view, we're providing research in data and analytics that is already paid for with hard dollars. When somebody gets the subscription to our products and services we are already paying for them, with a, to a subscription that is paid for with hard dollars, Euros, pounds whatever the currency is. And we are not part of the unbundling loops that is going to take place from the institutional self-side research analysis or now typically ramped in their soft dollars, which is part of a training credits or some sort of a training system. So, from a direct point of view, we don't think we are going to see any impact or business.", "Second, as the market does become unbundled and you see new ways for research to be delivered, our platform at market intelligence can be used by the investor banks to deliver research and we can do in a way that we are able to track usage, we are able to track how many times of different reports are opened, so that they can be charged, we can set up subscription approaches and we can do that and reach out to different types of investors and analysts that are using the kind of research we have today.", "Clearly the biggest question that's been coming up when I meet with you and your colleagues and peers is that, wilt her be any kind of negative impact on the research projects? And we don't know if that's going to, what kind of a potential make us impact it could be if there is a squeezing of research budgets and organizations have to look carefully about how they want to spend, how they want to spend their hard dollars overtime, if there is going to be any negative impact there. Well generally speaking, we are watching this very carefully, we're going to understand what it means for us, but, there is no direct impact initially.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Great and just a follow-up question, you know curious how investors should think about the plats business, in an up cycle relative to pass cycles. And the reason I asked that question is, you've done a ton of acquisitions in that business, it's more diversified, you probably have more supply demand data that you didn't historically when that acquisition was done. So, you know may be help us understand in a stronger oil and commodity market, I know you mentioned the business ticked up, but it could growth be similar to the numbers that business put up in the last up cycle? Granted we don't think energy is going to a 100 but, just curious any thoughts there? Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "Well first of all, our expectation right now for oil, is that it's going to be in a range somewhere in the $50 to $60 range, but, let's say $45 to $60 is the expectation that we have right now. At $45 you see people pulling up production when it gets into the mid 50s, people, sorry when you get there in the 40s, in the low 40s people stop producing, get into the 50s, 55, 60s people start producing more, you get more supply coming in. so, we've seen this dynamically, so we have a much more stable oil price. We've been growing portfolio of services that can allow us to provide all the way from the exploration and the well head to the refinery onto the product, with a combination of crude oil analytics, of refinery analytics, of shipping etcetera and we are just starting to see the promise of putting those businesses together to start growing. So, we think the plats in the overtime in the couple of different buckets, one is obviously the different acid classes and sales of petroleum, natural gas, energy, plastic, petrochemicals etcetera. And then the other is pricing and GTS, that go with trained services and secondarily the trade flow analytics and data products.", "And we are investing in all of those to see if we can grow our subscription businesses overtime and make this one of our growing businesses. But, we do see this stability should be beneficial to the business, but I can't initially forecast what that's going to mean for us in the future.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Very helpful thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question from Finn Matthew [ph] from William Blair. You may ask your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks, just one from me, I guess, on the indices you talked a bit about the margins, but can you elaborate a little bit more, I know you are trying to seen some sort of range, but it seems like we've seen kind of the second year of a little bit more investments and I think it's rational, but I guess can you talk about from here to the , should we see elaborate from this point or do you see a sustained period of wanting invest in new products and I guess the infrastructure of the business?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Hey good morning, this Ewout. So, let me first tell you about the big picture perspective have on this business and then I will provide a little bit more color, so overarching we think we can grow a business that has margins mid 60% range, mid 60% by 14% revenue growth during the quarter, that's a very good development and that creates a lot of economic value, for our shareholders. I have specific reasons why there was a 190 base point decrease in margins for indices this quarter. The first reason is, the addition of True cost on average is driving the margin down but truly that's a good investment and a capability that will help future growth. And secondly, there are some foreign related expenses, we think about certain royalties we have to pay where there is a revenue element on the one hand but then an offset on the expense line with respect to the royalty. So that is also having a slight impact on margins. But taken altogether, we believe that this is a business that we are able to grow, and the future is still at that mid-60% margin level in a very healthy way. So certainly we expect to continue to do that and will invest intelligently also in future growth in the Indices business.", "Unknown Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik. You may ask your question.", "Manav Patnaik", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. First, I just want to thank you guys for the notable increase in disclosure, color and commentary, very help for us. My first question is I guess around in the Platts side and Doug you pointed out the LNG product and the growth there and then in the Platts sort of break outside we saw power and gas I think declined 1%. And my guess is LNG is a fast-growing area but there just maybe some other offset there. So just a broad question on could LNG be a material contributor to that business, drive some more growth there, any thoughts there would be appreciated.", "Douglas Peterson", "Good morning, Manav. We look at the LNG business as one that's - which is really a long-term investment for us. I don't know if I could say that the contributions are going to be high over the next few quarters. I don't even know how long it will take to get there. But when it comes to development of a global market, this is one that we are investing in because we think it will become a significant global market. If you go back just about two years ago, the price of the BTU of LNG was $4 in Louisiana and $16 in Japan because there was no very unified markets through LNG but as the LNG terminals get built up around the world, cost for liquefaction and de-liquefaction and in particular with Korea, South Korea and Japan being the two largest importers over time, we really think this will develop into a global market and we would like to be on the ground floor. So right now we see it more as an investment market where we are buying the right kind of and building the right kind of capabilities to serve this market. And overtime it should get bigger and we hope it becomes one of our areas of growth.", "Manav Patnaik", "Got it. And then just on the bank loan rating and I guess it's the one side decision that's hard for us to track. So I was hoping for some color in terms of how penetrated you think you are in that market and I know it's been lumpy in the past, if any help, and how do you think in the next - in a couple of quarters it would be?", "Chip Merritt", "Yeah, so on the first quarter call, we shared some specifics with you, and once again I don't - how appropriate I think they were, but in the U.S. four or five years ago, we were up about 34% in the first quarter we were around 93%. And then when you got to Europe three or four years ago, we were down around 40% and got around 70% somewhere in there, but I encourage you to go look at first quarter slide. We might share that plot again, I didn't feel like putting it in there every quarter, but at least give you a sense for the really the big share gain, not taking share away from a competitor, but just more and more bank loans are rated.", "Douglas Peterson", "One of the things that I would also point out, it's not a Science what I am going to tell you, but it is a way that the bankers as well as issuers think about it. If you look at a combination of bank loan rate of high-yield bond proceeds and CLOs together, you will get a pretty good picture of what's happening in the high-yield markets because they are substitutes - somebody who couldn't go to the bond market, they could go to the bank loan market and they could also - the banks could securitize their loans and the CLOs. And when you look at those different volumes that's what - that's the way I look at the overall high-yield market, its different pieces. And clearly with the liquidity in the banking market in particularly in Europe and then in the United States with the access to the CLO markets for its banks and then there is a lot of investors who have also been interested in floating rate exposure as opposed to fixed rate exposure especially over the last few quarters. It's a combination of all of those factors that has driven such high activity in the bank loan rating market, and we do believe that we have a good penetration there and that we are one of the rating agencies that's a go-to rating agencies for that type of activity.", "Manav Patnaik", "Got it. Thank you for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Anjaneya Singh", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, on margin performance and Market Intelligence, up nicely year-over-year, but flattish as we have been perhaps than previous year, so in light of the synergy capture opportunity that you folks have in that segment, can you talk about what's limiting the sequential margin expansion there and any update on how the removal of some of the redundant cost is progressing?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Yeah, good morning. This is Ewout. Overall, we believe that there is a lot of opportunity to further expand the margins in Market Intelligence. You have seen very healthy growth with respect to revenues. So that is one side of the story and we believe we were talking before about the active users of the platforms. Ultimately that will help to drive up the revenues of the desktop in the future. Secondly, we believe there's opportunities for efficiencies, we are still working on the SNL integration. We will get back to you with an update at yearend where we are with those synergies, but we have all the reason to believe that we will be able to hit the target with respect to synergies we put out to you at the point of the acquisition but also at the beginning of this year. And lastly, if I look at the overall year-over-year trailing 12 months margin improvement; I am looking at 420 basis points margin improvement year-over-year. So we think that is a clear indication that we are on the right track. Again, growing the top line harder and higher than the expense line in the future, we will continue to derive the margins up.", "Anjaneya Singh", "Okay, got it. And as a follow-up I was wondering if you can share any updates on Project Simplify as you folks are moving to more of deploying pilots. Are you seeing any tangible improvements, just trying to get a sense of whether the initiatives are starting to bear fruit on the efficiencies or it's still little early to see the main results.", "Douglas Peterson", "What I would say is that it's two answers. The first answer when it comes to progress on getting the Project Simplify and pilots were making excellent progress with rolling it out across different practices and at some point, where we are going to be moving into the largest practices, where we are going to be rolling ourselves. So up until now, the philosophy is simplification and standardization of building an embedded control and thinking about an end to end data collection all the way to the publishing process has been really good work and the overall design progress, the piloting progress and how it is moving has been quite good. When it comes to the thing on the financial impact on it, it's starting to leak in, it's not a big driver of expense right now, but over time it's something that we will start becoming more significant, but as of now it has not been an important driver of expenses going down.", "Anjaneya Singh", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Silber from BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.", "Jeffrey Silber", "Thanks so much. I get one question that investors ask a lot, I want to paraphrase that. Hopefully you could help us out. So keeping focus on margins again but that seems to be the same today. Specifically, looking at your Ratings business, you said your long-term goal is in the low 50%, you are already taking over 53% year-to-date. Now you mentioned margin expansion continues based on revenue growth, you got some really strong revenue growth this year. I mean if we kind of go back to a normalized environment, do you think it's possible that margins could actually go down if you continue expanding in the Ratings business. Again long term I know where you are heading but maybe next year, would it be possible to take a step back before taking a step forward?", "Douglas Peterson", "Jeff this is Doug, that's essentially a bit of a theoretical question, but the mid-50s or the low 50s is a medium-term goal, not necessarily a long-term goal. Clearly, there are flows of issuance that we benefit from sometimes when there is higher flows we are going to benefit from as the part of our revenue stream which is the transaction based revenue and from the point of the view of - if there is a quarter that doesn't do very well and you have heard me say this many times before that we could easily see a quarter or two or even more where there is weak issuance and our top line is not as strong as it has been and the mathematical calculation of that could lead to a lower margin. So theoretically to your question you could feel lower margin but when it comes to how we manage our expenses and how we are managing our business overall, we are very conscious of improving our performance, improving our margins. But theoretically from your question, there could be some quarters that the top line growth is very meek, and it could hit our margin.", "Jeffrey Silber", "Okay, I appreciate the answer. Thanks so much.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "So let me build on Doug's answer. The other side there is we are staying very tight and disciplined with expenses. So particularly in this period with revenues going up, we don't want the expense line to go up too much. As you have seen, we have even announced a restructuring in Ratings at this point in time. So the benefit of that is when there will be some headwinds at some point in the future that we have an expense base that can withstand that in a healthy way. So certainly at that particular point that on the expense side, we continue to be very disciplined, and that should help in a theoretical scenario as you described.", "Jeffrey Silber", "Okay, thanks so much.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.", "William Warmington", "Good morning everyone. So a clarification question on some comments that Ewout had made on the Market Intelligence piece. When you mentioned that about a third of Cap IQ base had now converted over to the enterprise wide contract, I just wanted to understand that, is that specifically just an enterprise pricing model, or is that enterprise pricing model including the combined SNL as well. And part what I'm curious about is what percentage of the Cap IQ clients who are offered that option have taken it?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "So make sure we are clear, make sure - the products have not been combined yet just the commercial agreement, okay. All the SNL clients were already on enterprise-wide. So they were already there.", "William Warmington", "Right.", "Chip Merritt", "So as we then work through our Cap IQ customers, some of whom are also SNL customers and some of whom are not. That's what we were referring to at the third that we have made it so far. It's not really a question of acceptance or are there choice because in the future there will only be one commercial offering, one product, a combined product. So we have to get to one commercial offering. It's really in our choice in the future, so it's working our way through it. I am not sure. Does that answer your question, Bill?", "William Warmington", "Yes it does. Thank you, Chip. And then one of the question on the Ratings side, just wanted to ask, how much of a factor has first time issuers been in the strength that you have been saying? I don't know how much of that applies to the bank loan issuance in terms of the issuers versus the guys who were refinancing over the past nine months, but I wanted to ask that question.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "I think where you see it, I don't have the numbers at my fingertips but there is one way you can see it occurs in a proxy is to go back to our slides and look at the part of our Ratings, which is what was transaction revenue versus what was, let me just find that slide if I could. Yes, so if you look at on slide 26 of our slides, the non-transaction revenue increased 7% and that is driven partially by the new issuers that come on that pay us for entity rating. So that would be the one area I would say that you could look at for proxy. Otherwise I think it would be better if Chip call it up a bit later with some more specific data on that question.", "William Warmington", "Got it. Thank you for the insight.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research. You may ask your question.", "Craig Huber", "Yes good morning. I have two questions. First one, can you just talk a little bit further maybe seeing assumptions behind the comment early on Doug about global debt issuance up 1% or so in 2018. What is sort of the thought there behind where credit spreads be in that scenario, the yield curve, how much of that might go up over time, what's your expectation behind that GDP? Does that pick up significantly from here? Obviously, there is a huge refinancing walls during the next two years, and how do you sort of get to that 1% and that was the first question. Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "Okay, yes. So thanks for that. First of all, this is something that our fixed income research team in Ratings, they do this report few times a year. And the basis of this report is a combination of analysis of what is the refinancing pipeline. So what we are seeing in terms of maturities that are coming through and all of the different bond markets in the world. It's also a combination of looking at what's the expectations are for growth in the world. And there is one big wild card this year which is something I mentioned in prepared remarks about monetary policy and what kind of impact that could have. So just in terms of couple of the key components, first of all when it comes to issuance forecast in 2018 overall, it's for about a - basically flat, let's call it overall flat even though it might be around you know about 1%, but generally speaking it's flat.", "It's a combination of looking at financial services issuance, which is going to be up about 5%, structured finance up about 5%, U.S. public finance down about 7% and then overall globally corporate should be down a little bit based off of the maturity profile that's out there. And as a result of that, you see that the overall forecast is as I said flat up maybe you know about 1% to 2%. When it comes to GDP growth rate, our team is forecasting GDP growth rate next year on the global scale about 3.6% with the U.S. in the lows two's around 2.2%, 2.3%. We are also expecting that there will be three 25 basis point interest rate increases in the U.S. as the U.S. Fed Reserve starts to normalize monetary policy further and that's also something which is going to play in the market.", "We don't necessarily think that there is going to be an increase in December but those three will most likely be next year. And that in Europe, there might be a slowdown or a potential paper of the purchase of bonds in the European market. So again these are all of the different factors that we look at maturities, we look at what's happening with overall with the interest rate, the base rate interest rates in the global market's expected growth. And the growth in the global economy is actually pretty good right now. There is only six countries around the world including Venezuela, they are not growing. And it's been a long time we have seen sequential coordinated growth across the entire global economy especially after coming out of financial crisis. So all of those generally give us a pretty positive, or benign to positive environment, and we look at that when we are preparing this forecast.", "Craig Huber", "Thank you for that. Another question, Doug, I think you mentioned earlier on that third quarter global issuance I guess the rate I believe was down 7%, your revenues, your transactional revenues were up 24%. Can you just talk a little bit further about the mixed issues while you outperform that revenue side soft handedly please?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, so first one we talked about and we were very specific about this quarter was the bank loan ratings and that's something when we talk about issuance we are including the bank loan rating market. That's - when we talk about issuance we are talking about fixed income instruments that are issued by governments, by financial institutions, by corporates, by municipal et cetera. And so the first really one of the important elements was the growth in bank loan rating. The second is in terms of the mix. When sovereign is an example was down about 11% but we don't get a lot of income from sovereign. It's not an area that drives a lot of our income growth. In addition, there is industrial side in the U.S. the corporate issuance was up 6.5% and that for us is one of the key drivers.", "The corporates are those that go-to market, they pay us the ongoing issuer fees as well as how they are going to the market. There is also an addition, maybe the commercial paper market was strong in the last quarter with a lot of issuance there that maybe again hasn't really picked up. But think about for us the industrial corporate markets in U.S. were up 6.5%, financial services up 9% and despite the downturn in Europe in corporates and financial services, those were offset by the U.S. issuance. And then secondarily, CMBS and CLOs were up in both markets, in the Europe and the U.S. So it's been about the components, corporate issuance, financial institutional issuance and the world's largest capital markets in the U.S. and then structured finance issuance in Europe and the U.S. both in CMBS and CLOs, both of those up. Those are the components that drove the increase despite the total market being down.", "Craig Huber", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now take our final question from James Friedman from Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question.", "James Friedman", "Well thank you for taking me in here, I think most of my questions were answered, but I did want to follow-up about that slide 9 Doug about the banner year for bank loans. I knew you had a lot of questions about it, but you guys have been consistent when this is a theme since the first quarter. I guess my question is, it's a little bit difficult parse what is your gain in market share versus say the cyclical versus may be importantly the structural growth in this end market. I was wondering if you could help parse that between Europe and the U.S. we are trying to evaluate how sustainable this is and clearly you made a lot of progress since 2010 on the slide, but we are trying to anticipate how this is going to look going forward. Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "First of all thank you for the question. If you look at the instead of slide 9, if you look at slide 10, this gives you a view of what are the majorities over this following years and next 10 years at the end of each of these periods and that I think is the way to look at what is the potential growth of this market. I am not going to say that you can never predict what's going to happen in the future, but this just gives you a view of in 2011 when I joined the company, I could see from having worked in a bank setup, the bank loan market was going to actually expand and we put a major focus on this in 2011 when I joined the ratings business, because I knew from coming from the banking world, but this is going to be a major focus of the banks given the kind of capital allocation and risk capital approaches that were being imposed from the regulators.", "And so we have seen now that over the last seven or eight years we have seen a 11 % triggered growth in that what you consider to be the majority if are going to call that the next 8 years were the majorities. The mix of this - this is the U.S. leveraged loan market on this slide. So this doesn't give you the European piece of that, but the European piece of this we look at that as the markets get more sophisticated and as the bank loan market gets more sophisticated that benefits us with the CLO markets as well as bank loan rating. But also as those many of those bank loan ratings turn into issuance they move from a bank loan into a bond issue that also benefits us as well.", "And remember one of thing typically the leveraged loan market are double the plus or lower rated issuers which is the non-investment grade or the speculate type of issuance which is also one where we typically get a better type of the fee profile in the investment grade. So we look at this overall as it is really important area for us to stay close to, to watch the evolution in the mix between the different types of markets, loan markets, CLOs and non-investment grade its I think it's all kind of wrapped up into one broader type of non-investment grade market. And we think that one of the really good stories for last few years has been the leveraged loan market.", "Craig Huber", "And I think what we will do in the fourth quarter is resurrect that first quarter slide that shows the market shares that several of you have asked about that, so we will resurrect that chart in our fourth quarter. And you can get sense for that. The one thing I want to add is the underlying reason why these things are rated okay, if a bank were to keep the loan on books related to the loan they wouldn't need to get it rated. But if they want the flexibility they get that loan off of their books maybe wrap it up a CLO or sell it off. Then having a rating is very, very beneficial to them. So I think this to understand the logic behind why it occurs as [ph] that will occur in the future.", "James Friedman", "Thank you.", "Douglas Peterson", "Okay, James, any more question from you?", "James Friedman", "Oh, no. that's it for me. Thank you very much.", "Douglas Peterson", "Great, thank you. Well, let me close the call by thanking everyone for being on the call today. I think that consistent overall was how we have been doing this year. We delivered another very strong quarter and as you have heard throughout from our commentary as well as the questions and answers we are committed to continue to improve our margins. It's something that is important to us to have expense discipline, but at the same time also deliver high quality, highly valued relevant products to the markets. Whether it's things we have talked about over the years the strength we already have in industries and commodities and markets intelligence and ratings or at areas that we started growing in related to supply chain analytics in the energy industries whether it's the ESG products and climate and green evaluation areas where we also see a lot of relevance for us to create new standards as the markets continue to evolve. And we thank you very much again for all of your questions and we look forward to interacting with you as we approach the end of the year and we will be back on this call in about three months. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presented slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com.

Thank you for joining S&P Global's earnings call. Presenting on this morning's call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "This morning, we issued a news release with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Jason Feuchtwanger at 212-438-1247.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?", "Douglas Peterson", "Good morning. Thank you, Chip. Welcome to the call today.", "S&P Global completed an exceptional year with strong fourth quarter results with every division delivering topline growth or investing in new products and enhancing productivity. I\u2019m going to review our full year highlights and financial performance and Ewout will review the fourth quarter results for the moment.", "Let me begin with the full year highlights. Every division produced strong financial performance while investing in new products and productivity. We delivered impressive financial performance with 13% organic revenue growth and 29% adjusted EPS growth. We generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $1.4 billion through share repurchases and dividends.", "We introduced a new capital management framework which includes our commitment to returning capital to our investors and late in the year, we realigned the company by installing a new integrated operating model designed to stimulate innovation and drive digital transformation. This should enable us to work together more efficiently as all of the businesses will have access to share digital infrastructure, data operations and engineering and technology.", "We're fortunate to have so many iconic brands and products but none are as widely recognized as the S&P 500 which celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2017 but we must continue to invest in new products and strategic partnerships to maintain a competitive edge. Some examples from 2017 include when S&P Dow Jones Indices launched the S&P Green Bond Select Index.", "ICE launched LNG derivative contracts which are cash settled against the Platts LNG Gulf Coast Marker. Ratings launched Green Evaluations which aim to provide investors with a more comprehensive picture of the green impact in climate risk attributes to bond. We reduced the first release of the new Market Intelligence platform to all SNL users and a beta release to our investment banking customers.", "And we advanced in fintech with investments in Algomi, a company that has created a bond information network. Kensho, a company that provides next-generation analytics, machine learning and data visualization versus space systems, a satellite imagery data and analytics provider, an acquisition by CRISIL Pragmatix, a data analytics company for the banking, financial services and insurance industry.", "Looking more closely to full year 2017 financial results, the company reported 7% revenue growth and reached 13% growth on an organic basis. The company achieved a 420 basis point improvement in adjusted operating profit margin due to strong organic revenue growth, the sale of lower margin businesses and productivity initiatives.", "We delivered exceptional earnings with adjusted diluted EPS of $6.89, 29% higher than in 2016. This figure includes $0.04 a share on favorable impact from ForEx and $0.28 a share favorable tax benefit related to stock-based compensation both of which Ewout will discuss in a moment.", "The financial success in 2017 was not an isolated event. Over the last four years, we produced a 7% compounded annual growth rate in revenue. In addition over the same timeframe, we've improved our adjusted operating profit margin by over 1200 basis points.", "The company has consistently grown adjusted EPS with a four year CAGR of 20%. The multiyear growth in revenue, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted EPS are noteworthy achievements, however we are not done. We believe there is still plenty of opportunity to improve all of these metrics.", "The strength of our portfolio is particularly evident on this slide as every segment delivered strong gains in organic revenue and adjusted operating profit. Keep in mind that the markets and commodities intelligence reported results were negatively impacted by the sale of several businesses.", "What I\u2019d like to do now is provide color on some of the 2017 drivers of our Ratings business. This chart breaks down the components of full year 2017 global issuance but instead of depicting financial and nonfinancial issuance, this shows the split between investment-grade and high-yield.", "Excluding sovereign issuance which is not a major driver of our result, 2017 global issuance increased 7%. Because high-yield issuers are seldom part of the frequent issuer program, their issuance is more impactful to our revenue than other categories. So this 53% increase in high-yield issuance was a key factor in Ratings revenue growth in 2017, an 18% increase in structured finance issuance was also a strong contributor.", "When tracking issuance data, we always try to point out that where issuance takes place, which type of issuance, and the size of the deals makes a difference in the revenue we realize. Global issuance in the fourth quarter excluding sovereign debt increased 19% with strength across all regions. Geographically issuance in the United States increased 19% in the fourth quarter with investment-grade increasing 6%, high-yield soaring 47%, public finance increasing 39%, and structured finance increasing 12% due primarily to strength in ABS in RMBS.", "In Europe, issuance increased 20% in the quarter with investment-grade increasing 15%, high-yield vaulting 192%, while structured finance dropped 7%. In Asia, issuance grew 15%. The vast majority of Asian issuance however is made up of local China debt that we don't rate.", "Leveraged loan volumes become increasingly important to our revenue based on two factors. First, the level of issuance is increased over time, and second the percentage of loans rated has increased over time. This chart depicts both of these trends as they have played out in the U.S. and Europe.", "In the U.S. the percentage of loans rated increased from 57% in 2012 to 89% in 2017. In Europe the figure increased from 48% in 2012 to 73% in 2017. For all of 2017, bank loan ratings revenue increased 39% with exceptional growth earlier in the year. During the fourth quarter, bank loan revenue of $83 million contributed to the revenue growth in Ratings.", "In a moment, Ewout will provide more information on our fourth quarter results, but first I want to turn to our outlook for 2018, and let's start with our global economic forecasts. Our current economic outlook calls for continued global growth, in fact our expectation for 2018 is 3.8%, slightly ahead of our 2017 forecast of 3.7%.", "In the U.S., low unemployment continues to contribute to growth. In 2017, job gains averaged 171,000 per month. In addition, new tax cuts should accelerate business and consumer spending. After years of anemic growth, the Eurozone is experiencing a strong cyclical rebound led by Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.", "In China, authorities are focusing on a sustainable macro credit path or pursuing growth friendly policies. In Latin America stable commodity prices and low long-term interest rates in advanced economies have increased capital flows. Many of our businesses benefit from stronger global growth, so the expectation for improved global GDP is very encouraging.", "Two weeks ago Ratings issued its annual global refinancing study. This yearly study shows debt maturities for the upcoming five years. The chart on the left illustrates data from the 2017 and 2018 studies. The five-year period in 2018 study shows a $600 billion increase in the total debt maturing over the 2017 study. We use this study along with other market-based data to forecast issuance.", "Taking a closer look at data from the study reveals an important trend in high-yield maturity seen in the chart on the right hand side of this slide. Over the next five years, the level of high-yield debt maturing significantly increases each year which is a potential source of revenue in the coming years.", "In January Ratings published it's 2018 issuance forecast. This forecast provides estimates for each of the major issuance categories. Importantly, we anticipate the impact of U.S. tax reform may produce a neutral to modestly negative impact on 2018 issuance.", "For 2018 excluding international public finance which is not material to our results, we expect a medium decrease of approximately 1% in 2018 in overall issuance. Our forecast of a 31% decline in U.S. public finance due to tax reform will likely be off-site by increases in global structured finance and financial services. We expect a 2% decline among non-financial corporates due to some factors from the U.S. tax reform.", "While not depicted on this slide, 2018 U.S. leveraged loans are expected to be flat or possibly decline with fewer refinancings after completing the busiest year ever for leverage loans. In Europe, 2017 leverage loan volume was at its highest since 2007.", "Europe will likely also see refinancing in 2018. Although both the U.S. and Europe could experience a pickup in funding for mergers and acquisitions with private equity and corporate issuers looking to take advantage of improving economic conditions.", "As we begin 2018, let me share some highlights of our enterprise goals. Creating shareholder value is always a top priority but we would like to add to our strong track record in 2018. We're introducing mid single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $8.45 to $8.60. This EPS guidance includes more than $1 per share, $1 per share of expected benefit from a lower effective tax rate due to U.S. tax reform. Ewout will provide additional detail on our guidance in a moment.", "The core of our strategy and purpose revolves around serving markets and fulfilling the needs of our customers. Some key initiatives include increasing investments in new technologies, alternative data in ESG. We embrace data science and machine learning to drive product innovation and internal productivity.", "Growing ratings beyond the core through expansion of additional credit tools include ESG, Green Evaluations and Ratings360.

We will issue a press release with details of the event along with an invitation RSVP as get closer to the date.", "Now let me turn the call over to Ewout to provide more specifics on both our business results during the quarter and our 2018 guidance. Ewout?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Thank you, Doug and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning I would like to discuss the fourth quarter results, the impact from U.S. tax reform on our results and then provide specifics on our 2018 guidance.", "The company finished the year with exceptional results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 14% with growth in every segment. Adjusted unallocated expenses increased 19% primarily due to performance related incentive compensation cost and a companywide IT project to replace our order to cash system.", "Adjusted operating profit increased 28% and adjusted operating profit margin increased 530 basis points. Our adjusted effective tax rate declined to 28.5% primarily due to the discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises which I will overview in a moment. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 44% to $1.85 per share.", "We introduced this slide during the third quarter earnings call and have updated it today. A recent change in FASB guidance related to stock payments to employees result in a tax benefit when employee stock options are exercised and this change also results in the tax benefit whenever employee stock grants vest and the fair market value of the stock exceeds the grant price. These impacts are recorded as reductions in tax expense.", "During the fourth quarter, we reported a reduction in tax expense that improved fourth quarter adjusted EPS by $0.08, $0.06 was due to the vesting of restricted stock which occurs each year in the fourth quarter and $0.02 was due to the exercise of stock options. We estimate that there will be a beneficial impact for 2018 EPS of $0.10 to $0.20. This benefit is reflected in our 2018 effective tax rate guidance.", "Net of hedges, foreign exchange rates had a $16 million positive impact on the company's revenue and a $3 million positive impact on adjusted operating profit or about $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter. The bulk of the impact was under rating segment. Ratings adjusted operating profit was primarily impacted by the Euro and the British pound.", "Now let me turn to adjustments to earnings to help you better assess the underlying performance of the business. Pretax adjustments to earnings totaled to a loss of $124 million in the quarter and these included an increase in our legal settlement reserve, restructuring actions in Ratings, Market Intelligence and Corporate. Despite strong results, we are continuously looking for opportunities to transition to leaner and more effective organizations.", "Lease exit charges associated with vacating double floors of space in London and New York as we continue to try to minimize our footprint in high cost locations. Together these restructuring actions and lease exits will result in annual savings of approximately $40 million.", "$25 million in due related amortization expense, a charge associated with U.K. retirees or due to a change in the law chose to take a lump-sum payment from the defined benefit pension plan. These pretax items total $124 million. Because of U.S. tax reform, we're taking a net tax charge of $149 million which I will review in a moment. In addition, we incurred a tax benefit from prior year divestitures of $21 million. These two after-tax items total $128 million.", "In the fourth quarter led by ratings every business segment contributed to gains in organic revenue, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating profit margin. It's very gratifying to see strength in every segment and progress in every metric.", "Let me now turn to the individual segment's performance and start with Ratings. Ratings revenue increased 20% or 18% excluding the favorable impact from ForEx. Adjusted operating profit increased 40%, while the adjusted operating margin increased 810 basis points to 55.6%.", "As we have said in the past, we managed the ratings business on a rolling four quarters basis and you can see on that basis the adjusted operating margin increased 400 basis points to 53.8%. This marks the 6th consecutive year that the adjusted operating profit margin has improved by more than 100 basis points, as the business continues to successfully grow revenue and identify and implement productivity initiatives.", "Both transaction and non-transaction revenue recorded very strong growth. Non-transaction revenue increased 12% due primarily to growth in fees associated with surveillance, short-term debt including commercial paper and new entity ratings. Transaction revenue increased 29% primarily from gains in U.S. corporate bonds particularly high-yield bonds, global structured products and a modest gain in bank loans.", "If you look at Ratings revenue by its various markets, you can see there were gains in every category with the greatest gains in corporates and structured products. Corporates revenue was boosted by a large increase in high-yield issuance structured finance revenue increase with gains in every asset class.", "Let me now turn to market and commodities intelligence. This segment includes S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts. In the fourth quarter, reported revenue increased 7% and organic revenue increased 8%. Due primarily to divestitures, organic growth and synergies realization, adjusted operating profit improved 13% and adjusted operating margin improved 200 basis points to 36.5% and full-year adjusted operating segment margin increased 310 basis points to 37.2%.", "Turning to Market Intelligence excluding recent divestitures, organic revenue grew 10% with growth across all major categories. We continue to benefit from a diverse sets of customer types with commercial banks, insurance companies and private equities bolstering growth.", "At the beginning of 2017, Market Intelligence combined the former SNL and Capital IQ sales team into one market intelligence sales force and transformed the commercial model into one offering that is priced on an enterprise wide contract. This commercial process has contributed to growth of Market Intelligence desktop users which increased 15% versus the end of 2016.", "At the end of the third quarter we told you that approximately one-third of RatingsDirect and Capital IQ desktop businesses has been conferred as to enterprise-wide commercial agreements. At the end of the fourth quarter, that figure reached approximately 55%. In addition we have migrated nearly all former SNL users to the new market intelligence platform. As with any beta release, our customers have provided important feedback and we're actively working to resolve all of the items on our funds list.", "Looking more deeply at Market Intelligence revenue, all three components delivered strong organic revenue growth. Desktop products grew 9%, data management solutions increased 12%, risk services grew 9% with ratings Xpress and RatingsDirect providing low teen and high single-digit growth respectively. And finally note that there was $5 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 from businesses that were divested.", "When we announced the acquisition of SNL back in 2015, we established a $70 million synergy targets through 2019. This divest was later increased to $100 million. Over this period, we have delivered a significant improvement in the adjusted operating margin of this business. Today we are announcing the successful completion of the $100 million synergy program. We estimate that approximately $50 million of savings were reflected in our 2016 results and that an additional $25 million of savings were reflected in our 2017 results.", "By the end of 2017, all projects have been launched. In total this program will deliver $105 million in annual synergies with $85 million of cost synergies and $20 million of revenue synergies. In addition to delivering on our synergy commitment, we have created a fully integrated business with a powerful new platform.", "The Market Intelligence platform was built on the foundation of rich S&P Capital IQ financial data and deep SNL sector data combined with trusted analytics. The new Market Intelligence platform leverages the technology behind its predecessor the SNL platform to offer an intuitive interface with content and functionality that can be accessed on any device.", "Turning to Platts. Revenue increased 5% with a core subscription business growing mid single-digit. This was somewhat offset by global trading services revenue which decreased mid single-digits primarily due to weaker derivative trading in petroleum and metals.", "Beginning in 2018, Platts will be managed as a separate business and reported as a separate segment. To help you with modeling, Exhibit 10 in the press release has Platts pro forma 2017 data on that basis.", "If you look at Platts revenue by its four primary markets, you can see that petroleum and power and gas makeup the majority of the business. Platts growth this quarter came primarily from petroleum which benefited from solar subscription growth partially offset by weak global trading activity. In addition, petrochemicals contributed 10% growth and metals and agriculture increased 8%.", "Let me now turn to indices. Revenue increased 12% mostly due to continued growth in ETF assets under management. Adjusted operating profit increased 16%, adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 63.7%. For the full-year, the adjusted operating margin declined 10 basis points primarily due to the acquisition of Trucost.", "Asset linked fees which are principally derived from ETFs mutual funds and certain OTC derivatives experienced the greatest growth in the fourth quarter rising 17% driven by a 34% increase in average ETF AUM. Exchange traded derivative revenue rose 12% with gains in S&P 500 Index options and fixed futures and options activity. Subscription revenue decreased 3% with modest organic growth offset primarily by the timing of customer reporting.", "The trend of assets moving into passive investments shows no signs of letting up with the exchange traded products industry reaching net inflows of $174 billion in the fourth quarter and establishing a new annual record with yearly inflows of $633 billion and this is an increase of about 67% over the prior record inflows in 2016.", "The year ending ETF AUM guide to our indices totaled $1,343 billion up 31% versus the end of 2016. As the chart shows, this was a result of $146 billion of net inflows and $174 billion of market appreciation over the last 12 months. The $1,343 billion is a new record.", "The fourth quarter average AUM associated with our indices increased 34% year-over-year. This is a better proxy for revenue changes than the quarter end figures. Exchange rate of derivative volume was mixed. Key contracts include increased S&P 500 index options and fixed futures and options which experienced robust activity and a decline in activity at the CME equity complex.", "Now turning to our capital position. At the end of 2017, we had $2.8 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of short and long-term debt. Approximately $2.1 billion of our cash was held outside the United States at the end of the year. Our debt coverage as measured by adjusted growth leverage to adjusted EBITDA declined slightly to 1.9 times versus 2.1 times at the end of 2016.", "2017 free cash flow was approximately $1.85 billion of which nearly $700 million was generated during the fourth quarter. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we paid out approximately 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2017. The company returned $1 billion to repurchase 6.8 million share and $421 million in dividends for a total of $1.4 billion.", "As we look at U.S. tax reform we are impacted in three principal areas. First, we have recorded a net charge to Texas of $149 million in the fourth quarter. This is composed of a $173 million tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings. The cash tax payments will be made over the next eight years. This expense is partially offset by a $24 million tax benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities.", "Second, tax form will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate. We estimate that we will have an effective tax rate of between 21% and 22.5% in 2018 down considerably from the 28.9% adjusted effective tax rate in 2017.", "Third, the reduction in our effective tax rate will generate approximately $200 million both additional cash flow in 2018. The U.S. tax reform will have an impact on cash availability and capital deployment. Our ability to generate free cash flow will substantially increase as a direct result of the lower effective tax rate.", "We now have access to offshore cash and our first priority is to reinvest it in our businesses and to strengthen core capabilities consistent with our strategic priorities and disciplined capital management philosophy. We will continue to return at least 75% of annual free cash flow generation through dividends and share repurchases.", "Today we announced a large dividend increase of 22% bringing the annualized dividend rate to $2 per share supported by a significant increase in our net income and free cash flow and our desire to support the dividend yields. This marks the 45th consecutive year of dividend increases.", "Also we are making a stepped up investment in our communities through a $20 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation in the first quarter of 2018. Note that this will impact our first quarter results.", "Now lastly I will introduce our 2018 guidance. This slide depicts our GAAP guidance. Please keep in mind that our guidance reflects current spot market ForEx rates. This slide shows our adjusted guidance, an increase in revenue of mid single-digit with contributions by every business segments. Unallocated expense of $160 million to $170 million, pension benefit of $25 million to $30 million and the past most of this benefit or cost was included in unallocated expense.", "Due related amortization of $95 million, operating profit margin in a range of 47.5% to 48.5%, interest expense of $145 million to $150 million, a tax rate of 21% to 22.5% and diluted EPS which excludes deal-related amortization of $8.45 to $8.60. In addition we expect capital expenditures of approximately $125 million and free cash flow excluding certain items of approximately $2.3 billion. Overall this guidance reflects our expectation that 2018 bolstered by continued performance improvements and by U.S. tax reform will be a very strong year for the company.", "With that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.", "Chip Merritt", "Thanks Ewout.", "Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants, please press Star 1 to indicate that you wish to enter the queue to ask a question. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press Star 2. I would kindly ask that you limit yourself to two questions; that's two questions, in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. If you've been listening through a speaker phone, but would like to now ask a question, we ask that you lift your handset prior to pressing Star 1 and remain on the handset until your question has been answered. This will ensure better sound quality.", "Operator, we'll now take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "This question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Research. You may now ask your question.", "Hamzah Mazari", "The first question is just on U.S. tax reform, you mentioned it\u2019s a neutral to slight negative, you also mentioned your global forecast for 2018 down 1% on issuance. Could you may be flush out the puts and takes in terms of it being neutral to slight negative. And then can investors expect that carry on effect in terms of you U.S. tax reform as you look towards 2019 issuance and beyond?", "Douglas Peterson", "First of all, when we look at tax reform we look at all the different aspects that could be impacting corporate, financial institutions, as well as public finance. First of all we look at some of the positives to the tax reform or economic growth. There is also going to be an additional amount of potential accelerated depreciation which would be leading to additional investment. So we see a lot of positives in the general economic conditions which as you know in the long run are what actually drive issuance.", "In terms of some headwinds to issuance, our repatriation of offshore cash could actually a slowdown issuance of companies that have been issuing what we call in the past a deemed repatriations or a synthetic repatriation. Our interest rate deductibility might have some impact on the high-yield market. And then the public finance market had a very robust fourth quarter in anticipation of different conditions in the market as well. So that as you saw we expect it would be down around 30%.", "But overall we look at then - in addition to what\u2019s the impact from tax reform, we look at general growth as I already said and we also look at maturities and you saw on the slides that we showed that there is a very robust pipeline of maturities especially starting in 2019 and going forward in all different types of issuance and in particular in high-yield issuance. So we've taken all of this into account as we've built our forecast for 2018.", "As you know always the mix is could change at any one time, I just want to give you one factor which is an interesting a mix shift. We do think that there is going to be strong financial services issuance in 2018. Last year in the United States financial service issuance for the entire year was up around 9% but it\u2019s actually down in the fourth quarter by over 13%, and in Europe it was up 65% for financial institutions issuance in the fourth quarter.", "So as you know there's always a lot of different pieces to the mix of how this comes through, but we go back to tax reform being a very positive impact for the economy overall. And even though it might have some headwinds on issuance from point of view of repatriation and a couple of other factors we do see that the economy is in a strong position.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Just a follow-up question, maybe for Ewout and then I'll turn it over. Your adjusted gross leverage to adjusted EBITDA is at 1.9 times - you've given us a range of 2.25 on the high-end. You've also said 75% of free cash flow goes back to shareowners, we're also upping the dividend considerably on tax reform. Is it fair to say that you guys are out of the market for larger M&A assets and most of the deal flow you're looking at is tuck-ins or can we expect sort of you can issue equity to do a large deal assuming valuations right? Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "You're right. We have given guidance with respect to our adjusted growth leverage in a range of 1.75 on the low-end and 2.25 on the high-end. We are very comfortably within that range at this point in time and as we have told you this morning we have 2.8 billion of cash by year-end of 2017 which is now largely unconstrained after the tax reform.", "So the balance sheet of the company is very strong. We're in a very good healthy financial position. We\u2019re obviously not commenting on any M&A opportunities, but what you should read out of the announcement this morning is we\u2019re clearly have the intention to reinvest in the business according to our strategic priorities, strengthen our core capabilities with the cash balance we have on our balance sheet today. And that could be organic, it could be inorganic. We would love as a first priority to reinvest that cash balance in our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now open.", "Alex Kramm", "Wanted to just come back to the Ratings forecast you put out there. I looked at the January piece you guys put out with a 1% decline, but obviously that's an overall number. So when you dig in a little bit deeper and look at the commentary, I think pretty big decline I think like 10% or so for high-yields when you back into it et cetera.", "So I guess when I put all this together look at the mix of the business, and maybe assume like 3% to 4% pricing bumps that you usually take. Now I guess it's something like 2% Ratings forecast revenue growth, is that kind of like in the range of what you're thinking for the Ratings business for 2018?", "Douglas Peterson", "Well if you look at our total guidance overall we put together for the entire company a guidance of the mid-single-digit range, as well as an improvement of a 100 basis points in our margin, that\u2019s our guidance for 2018. Included in that as you said give-and-takes on what\u2019s going to happen in the markets.", "Our overall outlook is about 2% decrease in overall corporate, industrial out of 5% increase in financial services, structured finance we\u2019re expecting an increase of about 4% for the year. And then U.S. public finance is one of the areas we think is going to be the most impacted by tax reform it will be down by about 31%.", "I\u2019ve always said in the past its going to depend also on what's the mix of high-yield and what sort of structured finance comes out. Just very quickly you know January doesn't make a quarter, issuance overall in January was down year-on-year but on the other hand noninvestment grade spec rate issuance was up very strong. It was up 27% in the U.S. But you know one month does it make a quarter, we do think that a lot of where we\u2019re going to come out is going to depend also on leverage buyouts on what's going to happen with the M&A market.", "And but we do think with the overall robust growth around the globe that this actually bodes well generally speaking for issuance. But we do see some of these as you saw in our forecast we did see lower issuance in particular from the corporates, but we built that into our forecast but I don't have a specific number related to the topline growth in Ratings.", "Alex Kramm", "Fair enough, I thought I'd try. And maybe just shifting on the margin side, obviously continued margin expansion pretty impressive even given them again as I said like softer outlook in Ratings if I just paraphrase I guess. But looking at the Market Intelligence now that you pulled out Platts I think last year it was something like 33% operating margin for that segment. Now I think that compares pretty favorably relative to like some other desktop players, but when you look at some of the pure play data providers out there, I mean some of those guys even have like 50% operating margins plus.", "So just thinking about - can you give us an update on your - what you\u2019re thinking the margin that business could get to, what kind of self-help opportunities we'll have in that segment. As you know I think a lot of that segment is actually proprietary data that - I think you have good pricing power on et cetera?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "You're right. Now we have provided you the details of the split of the margins between Platts and Market Intelligence. You see 33% margins for Market Intelligence both in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. And that is up approximately 260 basis points compared to 2016.", "We have indicated to you that we expect margin improvements for S&P Global as a whole in 2018. We haven't given you a breakdown for each of the segments. And what we should do is we realize with respect to the margins for some of our segments we're more or less at the point of our aspirational margin targets that we have provided for the mid-term.", "So we will come back during the course of this year with new mid-term aspirational targets for each of our segments. Most likely we will do at the Investor Day late May. So I cannot give you any specific guidance with respect to the Market Intelligence margin going forward from here.", "But what you may expect is we will drive operational performance for each of our businesses. We expect positive topline growth for each of our businesses. We look at operating leverages. We look at the efficiency opportunities and so on and so forth. So ultimately as Doug said in his prepared remarks, we are clearly believing that we can make S&P Global perform better also in the future.", "Operator", "This question comes from Mrs. Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Toni Kaplan", "I wanted to ask about the margins as well. So in Ratings very strong quarter also mainly driven I think by just the topline as well. But are there other factors that drove the strong Ratings margins this quarter, was it the flow through from growth or some other continued initiatives with regard to like pricing and simplification that you've been implementing over the last couple of quarters?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "We were especially pleased if you look at the performance of Ratings this quarter that despite a very strong topline growth, expenses were more or less flat and even slightly down if you take into consideration the FX impact. So the combination of such a strong topline growth and expenses flat and very disciplined drove the margin up by 810 basis points.", "What you have seen is announcements of restructuring actions both in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Those actions are applicable to several of our segments, but certainly also on the ratings. So we are looking continuously in transforming our organization to become more effective. So certainly we\u2019ll continue to look at the margins of Ratings and look at all the opportunities to improve those margins in the future as well.", "Toni Kaplan", "And then just on market and commodities, intelligence I think the margins there sequentially declined a little bit this quarter. Was there anything in particular that drove that and how should we look at margins in 2018 in that business? Thanks.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Yes, I think that\u2019s mostly driven by the Platts margins. So if you look at the details in Exhibit 10, you\u2019ll see that the Platts margins were bit lower at the second half of 2017 compared to the beginning of 2017. The main reason behind that is timing of certain expense categories. We saw commissions, incentives, compensation, as well as certain marketing expenses more back end loaded during 2017.", "We expect it to be more equally divided during 2018. So I would expect that - I would explain that more that it is more timing of those expense categories and Platts that drove slightly lower margin in markets and commodities intelligence at the end of 2017.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Manav Patnaik", "My question is around in the Market Intelligence, so you showed 15% increase in the user growth and so the first part of that question is just more around what's driving that particularly in the context of all the other challenges the industry is facing like MiFID and so forth that's gone in. And also just a disconnect on that 15% growth with the 9% revenue growth number you said for desktop.", "Douglas Peterson", "Well as you know we've been moving towards an approach where we provide enterprise-wide licensing to our customers in Market Intelligence. And what we've always talked about how this leads to more users signing up when you see an organization that has now given basically free access across the entire organization for all people to sign up and use the product. We see that the user increases and it's a good forward-looking measure for us in our ability to then talk to our customers in the future about the value of the contracts and the value that we're providing.", "As you know we have a very important discussion with customers at a value creation and value approach to how we think about the long-term relationship. And this is for us one of the benefits of the enterprise-wide pricing and this is one of the ways we can see it actually coming into effect.", "Manav Patnaik", "And I guess just the question on, if you're seeing any impacts like with MiFID and so forth?", "Douglas Peterson", "Yes, on MiFID we haven't seen any immediate impact on MiFID. Related to MiFID generally as you know we're not a sell-side research firm. We've always been a data and analytics provider the way we approach to our products and services that there are already paid for in hard dollars.", "One interesting thing of note, during December we saw over 90,000 of our users go in and look at their entitlements or change their entitlement, and we believe that was driven by a MiFID where people had to ensure that they had the right sort of entitlement in the system.", "We also though know that we have the ability to deliver research and be able to monitor and track usage and monitor and track how many people are downloading and as well as find ways that we can help it, sell-side get paid for the research.", "I guess the risk that we've got is that on the buy side, if a buy side start getting squeezed on their budgets overall because they're looking at how they're going to pay for research, it could be that there could we have a negative impact from total research budgets under strain but we have not seen any of that so far.", "Manav Patnaik", "And then just your thoughts on the acquisition of Thomson Reuters just you know may be competitively you see that changing your approach here.", "Douglas Peterson", "We don't see any major change to our approach. We do think that Thomson Reuters is a very formal competitor. We think that the competitive landscape is getting tougher all the time not just with people like Thomson Reuters taking approach of how they're going to be going towards market but there's also a very large number of additional of fintech's and other types of company coming into the markets. You also have a company's like ours and others looking at ways to apply artificial intelligence, natural language processing and different ways of serving the market.", "So we think that the Thomson Reuters transaction is going to make the markets more competitive but we welcome that competition and we're investing also to transform our business so that we can be more competitive as well.", "Operator", "This question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research. You may ask your question.", "Craig Huber", "Two questions please. One can you just give us a little bit better your outlook for speculative grade bank loans this upcoming year here obviously was very strong last year, so just given the thus seems rise in interest rate environment. What you guys outlook year for bank loans I guess in the U.S. and Europe if you could?", "Douglas Peterson", "Our general expectation is that bank loans are going to be flat to potentially down a little bit. Last year it was such a robust year and the first quarter, fourth quarter were both very strong throughout the year we saw the issuance. But it's going to depend a lot on what happens with high-yield financing, high-yield refinancing. It's going to also be driven by interest rates.", "We do see a market in Europe which has been incredibly robust. Over the last few years we've see more and more of financing taking place through the bank markets, as well as ratings - the loans being themselves rated. But our general expectation is that the bank loan market is going to be weaker than it was last year.", "Craig Huber", "And then also, if we switch over to China for net income interest update us if you would on changes at the government level in China to allow foreign rated agencies like yourselves and your competitors to rate underneath your own brand name in that jurisdiction there? And how impactful would that potentially be. Can you maybe size it for us potentially? Thank you.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "We are very interested and very excited about the opportunity that has come up in China. Let me elaborate on that a little bit. So today the domestic Chinese bond market is about the third largest bond market in the world. We are not active in that market today but we do rate international bond issuance by Chinese companies. So as Chinese companies want to accept the international bond markets those are being rated mostly out of our office in Hong Kong.", "The Chinese domestic bond markets in the past had some foreign ownership restrictions. So up to the mid of last year, we could not own an entity domestic ratings agency by more than 49% and that was the reason why S&P Global Ratings had never decided to enter that market but those foreign ownership restrictions have been lifted since the mid of last year, so we are actively looking at opportunities to enter that market at some point in time.", "There is still a lot of regulation that has to be issued so there's still a lot of uncertainty how this ultimately will play out but we are very actively following this and actively looking at the best way to enter the Chinese domestic bond market at some point in time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Hung from Autonomous. You may ask your question.", "Vincent Hung", "So just on adjusted unallocated expense, the 160 million to 170 million guidance looks to be up on the 1.1 figure from last year. Are you also including that 25 million to 30 million pension benefits while the actual increase is higher? Can you just talk about what's driving that?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "So that's a great question Vincent so let me explain that a bit because if you take all the pieces into consideration I fact you unallocated are - expenses are coming down year-over-year. So look at 160 to 170, then what is included in that number is a 20 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation, so you have it out.", "And then in the past the pension benefit, the pension income loss methods in the corporate unallocated expenses and now is broken out due to a new accounting rule. So what we have indicated is $25 million to $30 million of benefit that now is broken out but in the past was negative on that line. So if you look at those two elements and take those into consideration, in fact year-over-year corporates unallocated expenses are down.", "Vincent Hung", "And on the non-transaction revenues and ratings, there\u2019s been an acceleration in value growth there in the last few quarters. So can you just give us some color here in terms of how much relates to the pricing changes, the frequent insurer programs and whether win rate continue to 2018?", "Douglas Peterson", "On the non-transaction revenues, if you look at what the components are there, they are combination of frequent issuer fees, it's rating evaluation services that include some of the revenue from CRISIL and also includes short-term issuance under one year for instance our commercial paper. And it's really combination of all of those factors that is driving that growth.", "As you know there's been a lot of mergers and acquisitions activity that's been increasing in the Ratings valuation services. With the very, very attractive financial markets in the last year there been a lot of shorter-term issuance in the commercial paper market, that's been part of it.", "And then net, net we've also increased the number of new issuers and number of new issuers come to the market also has helped to increase that. So there's not any one specific factor, it\u2019s a combination of all of those together.", "Operator", "This question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. You may ask your question.", "Patrick O'Shaughnessy", "Just one from me, in early - I guess maybe mid-January as must put out, a report kind of complained a bit about lack of fee schedule clarity from you and your competition on the Ratings business. Any thoughts on implications of EMSA's views and any potential adjustment you might have to going forward.", "Douglas Peterson", "We have looked at that report that's where we've been working very closely with ESMA as well as with the Parliament in Brussels to understand the implementation of the rules for CRA 3 which were put in place about five or six years ago. One of the provision had a basically instructed ESMA to review the pricing markets and look at the cost structure of the rating agencies to see how that would be related to price - fees and prices.", "We think this is very, very early stages of what ESMA is going to be working on. We're working closely with them to tell them what we disagree with in their analysis. We do think that the overall structure fees relates to many, many different factors, it's not just cost alone. And so we are working closely with ESMA to give them our viewpoints and as of right now we don't see any impact to the markets and this is probably going to be a very long gain in how we work with ESMA and Brussels on the Ratings market in Europe.", "Operator", "This next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is [Drew Cumin] on for Joe. I was wondering if you could discuss some of the progression from the index business outside of equities?", "Douglas Peterson", "What is the exact question, what do you mean by progression?", "Unidentified Analyst", "What's going on with fixed income or ESG, any of the other opportunities?", "Douglas Peterson", "First of all as you know we have a combination of different approaches to revenues and in the index business we have our AUM fees, we have our data fees and then we have other services, ETM and ETD fees. So we're looking at how we can continue to diversify our revenue streams plus also how we can diversify and grow our - the economic impact of new opportunities like ESG.", "What you see is that we've made a lot of progress in fixed indices with new issuers going out of ETFs using fixed indices. We're seeing a lot of take-up of ESG, different types of ESG indices which use either some sort of a carbon, low carbon in particular environmental approach. None of those have any major impact so far or material impact on our revenues.", "The way we see the evolution of these types of products as we have to invest upfront, we have to build the relationships of the channel partners. We have to be responsive to what are the demands coming from asset owners and asset managers and come up with new indices that are responsive to those needs and as we build them and as we set the new products out, they start getting take-up and then that's when you start seeing the revenues.", "So in terms of our total revenues in the index business, none of these are creating any major material lift so far but in terms of volumes and growth, we believe overtime all of these are going to have more and more impact and it\u2019s going to be important to us that we also do have this innovation in this market relevance for what are the demands coming from the asset owners.", "Ewout Steenbergen", "And we broke out I believe it was in our second quarter earnings call, the year-over-year gains in fixed income and ESG and from a percentage standpoint they were significantly that Doug's point from a total standpoint that it will remove the needle in our business. And we\u2019ll likely put those out again probably in the second quarter next year based on annual survey that goes out.", "Operator", "This question comes from Jeffrey Silber from BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.", "Henry Chien", "Its Henry Chien calling in for Jeff, thanks. I just wanted to go back to the guidance for organic growth for 2018. Just thinking for 2017 there is a number of - I'd say special items that sort of drove pretty high growth rates in both ratings and the Market Intelligence. So just trying to understand how should we think about the mid-single-digit growth rate, is that driven by sort of the new market and new initiatives that you outlined early in the presentation. And just in light of issuance, it looks like just going to be down a bit this year as well? Thanks.", "Douglas Peterson", "Let me just clarify the question, when you say special items for revenue growth in Ratings and MI this year what are you alluding to there?", "Henry Chien", "Yes, I know not special item is wrong, I just meant there seem to be a number of strong growth headwinds in the year whether it\u2019s you know the pickup in issuance which was a record year and in the Market Intelligence side shifting over to the enterprise thing. Just thinking of those which don't sound like they would recur this year. So I'm just trying to understand what would be driving growth this year?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "You're right, we see a lot of positive momentum and positive drivers around our business. I can point at bank loans, I can point at corporate issuance in Ratings, below investment-grades, structured finance, I can point at the user growth in Market Intelligence. I can point at commodity pricing going up for our Platts business. I can point at move from active to passive investments in the indices business.", "So all of those drivers are very favorable and I have really helped the company to be positioned well for the future. And therefore you saw a 13% organic revenue growth for the company as a whole during 2017.", "We have guided to mid-single digit growth in revenue for 2018, that's mostly because we are now starting from much higher base then we were a year ago so we have to take that into account. But if you look at some of those drivers, we are confident that those will continue and will be continued positive drivers for the company going forward because we think those are not all market related, those are largely also related to methods where management can have some influence going forward.", "So therefore we think mid-single digit growth is a reasonable expectation for revenue growth during 2018.", "Douglas Peterson", "I just want to add one thing which is maybe a little bit philosophical it was embedded in the comments I made at the end about our 2018 enterprise goals. And you\u2019ve heard me talk about this for the last few years that we're driving towards having much higher quality customer experience, much commercial organizations that are out there customer focused, building products providing services that's relevant and responsive to our customer\u2019s needs. And we think this is critical in a very competitive world.", "We have to be out there that in a way that we\u2019re serving our customer needs and anticipating their needs in the future and we believe that this is actually one of the most important and necessary component to our topline growth is to have that approach to customers and not be complacent in very, very competitive markets.", "Operator", "This question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Peter Appert", "Buybacks versus dividends, the big dividend increase I assume doesn't suggest any shift and how do you think about the allocation between the two. And can you also related to that talk about how we should think about the timing of buybacks in 2018?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "If you look at the growth in dividends as such if you look at the underlying growth in net income and free cash flow, this is very much supported by those factors. Just look at the free cash flow in 2017, 1.85 billion going to 2.3 billion in 2018. If you look at that 2.3 billion and you take into consideration our commitment to return 75% of the 2.3 billion to our shareholders, then a 22% dividend increase is really in line with those underlying growth percentages.", "So I don't think you should read anything out of this that it is a shift in the mix. What you should read out of it is that the underlying fundamentals in terms of net income and free cash flow are really very strong and we expect also that to continue during 2018.", "Peter Appert", "And how about on timing?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Yes, timing obviously we are not commenting specifically on that management has a philosophy as you know that we\u2019re not market timers, we believe in dollar cost average that might be sometimes tactical decisions why we scale up or down is certain periods. But otherwise we like to be as much in the market as possible during the year.", "So I cannot give for obvious reasons further specifics on that, but we would like to be as much in the market as possible because these are significant numbers in terms of return of capital to shareholders. And like I said management doesn't believe that we should be market timers ourselves.", "Peter Appert", "And Doug your prepared comments might have suggested that you're seeing a little bit of pushback from Capital IQ users on the model change. Am I hearing that correctly and maybe you could just expand on that?", "Douglas Peterson", "No, I'm sorry if I gave you that impression, not at all. It\u2019s just that we have a very large number of clients we\u2019re going to have to go out to look at the approach to what their current contracts are. In some cases it's a combination of shifting from a per seat contract to an enterprise wide contract but also in some cases we have multiple contracts, it's an opportunity to go out and simplify our approach to a customer. In some cases we have five, six different contracts across different divisions of an organization that gives us a way to unify those contracts and to want to move them shift them to an enterprise-wide contract.", "My point is that the difficult to my point - this still has another year maybe even till the end of 2019 before we complete the final approach to all of the Cap IQ accounts on the conversion, but it's going very well. I'm sorry I gave you a different impression.", "Chip Merritt", "And if we use the word punch-list, you know what we\u2019re trying to deal with there is just anytime you have any sort of release there\u2019s going to be bugs, there\u2019s going to be things that need to be resolved and in fact the MI just had a new release over the weekend to deal with usability feedback and application performance and things like that.", "So just one trivial fact for you, if you\u2019re out there on an old Internet browser your speed seems to slow mostly we don\u2019t use that browser, but now we\u2019re fixing that. So that's a kind of thing that we work on.", "Operator", "This question comes from Conor Fitzgerald from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Conor Fitzgerald", "Just looking for a little more color when you mentioned on reinvesting back in the business some of the benefits of tax reform or is your marginal reinvestment dollars going?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "So we are looking at all of the opportunities to grow our businesses to reinvest and to strengthen our core capabilities. When we announce our capital philosophy and targets in the mid of last year, we have indicated some areas that are for us strategically important. Think about growing ratings in some of the emerging markets and looking at domestic ratings businesses. Think about indices for fixed income ESG international, Smart Beta. Think about in Market Intelligence our risk analytics and surfaces business, but those areas that are strategically important and then for Platts some of additional commodity price reporting without certain benchmarks or supply demand analytics.", "So those are the areas for the businesses itself. We\u2019re also looking at some core capabilities of the company, investing in technology, specific talents, and other areas that are important in terms of core capabilities for the company. We're looking at this investing on organic basis, inorganic basis, but please be assured we apply a very disciplined capital management philosophy metrics and look at the valuation perspective.", "So the company is very critical with respect to those opportunities that they hit certain hurdle rates that we think are important going forward.", "Conor Fitzgerald", "And then just looking for your thoughts, there has been a lot of more conversations recently about the potential for an infrastructure bill. Obviously there's a lot of ways such a bill could be structured if it did pass, but as we start to hear more about that over the coming months what are the key things you\u2019re focused on that could potentially drive a positive impact for your business if we do see and if it\u2019s a structure bill make its way to the Congress?", "Douglas Peterson", "Well as you know we've been looking at infrastructure now for over five years. We bolstered our infrastructure practices across the businesses in particular in Ratings. We brought in a team of people that are able to be very responsive infrastructure and that's not just in United States it\u2019s a global team.", "We've included additional data in analytics and Market Intelligence. We also have some infrastructure indices that we have through the index business. And then obviously Platts benefits from infrastructure investments in energy, and oil and gas, but the bill coming through Washington is going to have a few key elements that we\u2019ll watch carefully.", "One of them is permitting. Permitting is one of the areas which is quite slow in the United States compared to countries like Australia and Canada that have very robust approaches to infrastructure investment that also bring a lot of private capital. Permitting can be done a lot faster literally in a couple years instead of some cases United States 9 or 10 years. So we think that permitting is one of the critical factors that will get investment moving a lot faster into infrastructure.", "Second will be the approach towards support or leveraging capital coming from Washington into the states and local communities where most of the real infrastructure takes place. It's at that level, it\u2019s at the state and municipal level where most of that takes place and one of the factors on that is going to be an openness to seeing more public, private partnership as I said also very important in Canada and Australia.", "So the more we see private capital coming into infrastructure, the more we see it coming in a lot faster, when we see other fixes to the federal programs that are used for transportation and ports and airports, those will also stimulate more investment.", "So our overall view is the faster that this starts getting into the market, the more comprehensive the approach is and particularly if - you see us reach out to the states and municipalities, we\u2019ll see a robust infrastructure investment which will benefit growth, it will benefit jobs and part of that will be then more investment activity which we will be supporting through all of our different divisions.", "Operator", "This question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. You may ask your question.", "Tim McHugh", "Just want to follow-up the comment around some additional restructuring in the Ratings business. I guess can you elaborate on what type of activities are you doing at this point, is this still kind of trying to automate some of the roles, any color there would be helpful. And then secondly, I apologize if I miss this, but given exchange rate movements have you assumed a lift much to revenue as you think about the 2018 guidance here?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Tim, let me first take the restructuring question about the ratings and then I will make a few comments on your FX question. Ratings restructuring we\u2019re looking at many areas where we would find opportunities to make the organization more effective. I can give you two examples, one example is in our commercial organization. Until recently we had two commercial organizations in Ratings. We have moved those together we created one commercial organization and based on that restructuring, we\u2019re able to reduce the run rate particularly in more senior management positions going forward.", "Another example is the ongoing project simplified which is putting technology tools in place, workflow support and more standardization in the work of the ratings analysts and that will help with also efficiency, think about population of mobiles data intake, and so on that will be more automated so that our analysts can focus more to higher value-added work going forward. So those are clear areas where we see opportunities in Ratings going forward.", "With respect to foreign exchange rates, let me give you a couple of perspectives. The company's exposure is what we call a negative exposure on Indian rupees, British pound and the Australian dollars and negative exposure means we have higher expenses in those currencies and revenues. And we have positive exposure on Euro which means we have higher revenues in Euro then our expense base in Euro denomination.", "We have an FX program to offset to a large extent those exposures in order to make sure that the company's impact on economic basis is mitigated to some extent. So overall if you look at our guidance we have provided to you that is based on the most recent spot market rates with respect to ForEx and where our currencies are today we are confident that is properly reflected in the guidance we're providing you this morning.", "Tim McHugh", "And just one other follow-up in terms of numbers, the pension benefit that you're counting on for 2018 how is that compared to - I guess last year and the last couple of years. Is that kind of a normal level I guess now that is being broken out?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "Yes, it\u2019s more or less on a similar level if you compare it to previous years and the background there is that we have a well funded pension plan. So particularly the asset assumption on our plan is helpful to create this pension income but more or less similar compared to what we have been reporting in previous years.", "Operator", "This question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "First question is how is the tax deductibility of interest expense is treated by the recent legislation, how is that impact the forecast you have for leverage finance and some of the deals that will come from PE funds?", "Douglas Peterson", "We've been looking at this - we\u2019re trying to model it out. We see a very minor impact from this for a few reasons, one is that a lot of the companies that could be potentially impacted by the leverage rules are not paying taxes anyway and even though there's always been a theoretical tax shield to leverage type organizations just given their overall operating procedures and operating profits, they\u2019re not necessarily really paying taxes.", "We also think that there is a level of profitability which is about a six times leverage that's more or less where we've modeled it out that will still allow you to have deductibility of your interest expense. So we're not quite sure exactly what the impact is going to be but our initial modeling doesn't show that it\u2019s going to have that big of an impact because - leverage is a very, very legitimate way to use for corporate financing for different types of organization.", "And we've seen a little bit of fishing around for some other opportunities from the investment bankers looking at whether its securitizations or other types of tools that aren't necessarily directly financial tools or leverage. So, we don't think that we\u2019re going to see much of an impact.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "And then just in terms of the enterprise migrations with SNL Capital IQ. Is the increase in seat count largely from displacement of competitors or you just seeing people just put a lot of the organization on there that might not necessarily have had access to this kind of information beforehand? I'm trying to see basically competitively is this enabling you guys to displace competitors?", "Chip Merritt", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re seeing any meaningful displacement at this time. You might have someone who has access to competitive product and they have been using that competitive product. And now their firm gives them the opportunity to use our product so they might use them in conjunction in tandem for a while. So I don't think anything happens right away but over time I think that certainly robust.", "Douglas Peterson", "What I'd add is that a lot of the penetration that we have is new users. So as you mentioned when you get a new - a firm which has maybe 10 or 15 or 20 seats whatever it is and we open it up for a firm-wide enterprise-wide contract you see new users coming in. And then we've also been able to get some new customer. So customer growth itself is also important to us and that's another thing that we measure carefully.", "Operator", "We will now take our final question from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.", "Bill Warmington", "So quick question for you on the Capital IQ business. You had mentioned that sell-side is not a big part of what you do. But my question is given the fact that the sell-side is under a lot of cost pressure and likely facing more with MiFID II. What kind of an opportunity does that create for Capital IQ specifically since it\u2019s lower cost option versus Bloomberg and FactSet?", "Douglas Peterson", "First of all let me just point out, I don't have the figures in front of me Chip might have them at his fingertips. We believe one of the advantages of our business models that we are very diversified across different types of industries, investment banks, sell-side, buy side, we've got insurance companies, banks, other types of financial institutions, regulators, academic et cetera.", "So we believe that it's a model that allows us to have diversification across different kinds of users between the SNL content and the Cap IQ content which is coming together and other types of data services that we\u2019re adding specially alternative data services et cetera that we can provide multiple types of users with good experience, as well as the data they need.", "So we're not as dependent on any one type of industry, but in terms of overall your point of your question is, will we see an opportunity to displace other more expensive products? We believe that that is one of the areas where we can be more competitive.", "Bill Warmington", "Then a follow-up question on the index business, how big is Smart Beta and ESG within the index business these days. And then how long does it take to get to a point where it starts to move the needle?", "Ewout Steenbergen", "I think in absolute numbers it\u2019s still relatively modest certainly if you look at it from a revenue perspective. But this is the nature of benchmarking business, you have to invest early, you have to put a lot of effort in trying to become the standard in the market and once you are the standard you're being picked up then it can take off and your revenue streams in the future can be very large.", "So those kinds of investments can be over multiple years. Think about the fixed. That was an investment that was done over very long period of time to get over CBOE and at some point it took off and it is a very successful product at this point in time.", "So relative modest today, but that is exactly why we're making those investments. We\u2019re taking the benefit of the margin of the larger benchmark indices, and vest back into the new industries and over time that will be revenue driver for the company.", "Chip Merritt", "Bill if I recall if you go back to our second quarter slides we gave the exact number.", "Bill Warmington", "Got it.", "Chip Merritt", "I don't know the number exactly.", "Douglas Peterson", "And in addition it\u2019s also part of the custom indices business. This is one of the areas where it's not necessarily just ETS, we also see a lot of interest from structuring debts and investment banks which are using these types of products for their family offices and other sovereign wealth funds, other types of direct investors where we provide the structuring of the index itself that's responsive to their needs.", "Chip Merritt", "Bill found a number for you. At the end of 2016, Smart Beta accounted for 184 billion in assets side to it.", "Bill Warmington", "And then, okay, so end of 2017 - that's the reference point we don\u2019t have the 2017 number?", "Chip Merritt", "That was the end of 2016. So I don't have a new end of 2017 number for you yet.", "Bill Warmington", "I look forward to seeing. Thank you very much for the insight.", "Douglas Peterson", "Thank you, this is Doug. Let me just make a couple of closing comments. I do want to comment very briefly on the market drop yesterday, 1,175 points in Dow Jones. It was the largest drop in history in index point terms, but it actually doesn't even make the list of the top 10 drops in percentage terms. Given that we've been managing this since over 125 years, we've got all the data and it's actually the 100 largest single drop in percentage terms. So its way down there, it\u2019s only number 100 in overall percentage terms and we think we should put that in context.", "We've built our plan, our approach to the markets looking at the economies right now which are growing. Our inflation is still low, rates are still low, banks have very strong liquidity and very strong capital around the world, tax reform we think is a tailwind for the U.S. economy. And so we do believe that overall economic conditions putting aside some volatility in the markets and all of the transformation taking place and technology around us are going to be very positive aspects to how we\u2019re going to grow the business going forward.", "We\u2019re very pleased that we concluded 2017 with strong momentum and very strong performance. Our topline growth for the entire year of organic growth of 13%, the margin improvement that we've been carrying through for the last five years. We are starting off the year also benefiting from U.S. tax reform with a strong position in cash and capital with a very good leadership team and what we think are very promising approaches to how we're going to work with the markets in the future.", "So, we appreciate all of you listening on the call. We look forward to working with you during the year. We will be on our first quarter call in between now and the time we see you at our Investor Day. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "That concludes this morning\u2019s call. A PDF version of the presented slides is available for downloading from investor.spglobal.com.
