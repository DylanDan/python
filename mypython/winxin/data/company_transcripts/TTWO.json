As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Hank Diamond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.", "Henry A. Diamond - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Good afternoon. Welcome and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 ended June 30, 2017. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.", "Actual operating results may vary significantly from the forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors.

Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2018 is off to an excellent start, with our business's positive momentum continuing to exceed our expectations in the first quarter. Take-Two delivered growth in both net sales and net revenue, as well as margin expansion.", "Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online continued to outperform our expectations during the first quarter, nearly four years after their initial release. Grand Theft Auto V remains the highest-rated game of the current console generation and the must have title for gamers on both console and PC.", "Grand Theft Auto Online delivered its best quarter ever, substantially exceeding our net sales expectations, and was once again the single largest contributor to recurrent consumer spending. Rockstar Games has continued to drive sustained engagement and growth in recurrent consumer spending through the ongoing release of free additional content, most recently the Dawn Raid, Overtime Rumble, and Power Mad updates.", "On the heels of the June 13 release of the substantial Gunrunning update, June and July successively became our two biggest months ever for Grand Theft Auto Online monthly active users. And Rockstar Games will continue to support the game going forward. As a result of Grand Theft Auto Online's performance in the first quarter, we now expect the game to deliver net sales growth during fiscal 2018, another consecutive year of record results.", "NBA 2K17 remains the top-rated sports game of the current console generation and is now our highest-selling sports title ever with sell-in to-date of more than 8.5 million units. In addition of robust demand for the game itself, net sales from our NBA 2K series continue to benefit from strong engagement and recurrent consumer spending. During the first quarter, recurrent consumer spending in NBA 2K once again exceeded our expectations and grew 64%. NBA 2K has been a tremendous success and we believe that the series can continue to grow both unit sales and recurrent consumer spending for years to come.", "In addition, a number of other titles from our diverse portfolio contributed to our first quarter results, including Social Point's free-to-play mobile titles, WWE 2K17 and WWE SuperCard, Mafia III and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. Digitally-delivered net sales exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, driven by growth in both recurrent consumer spending and full game downloads. Recurrent consumer spending increased 71% and accounted for 58% of total net sales.", "In addition to virtual currency for Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K, a variety of other offerings contributed to recurrent consumer spending. In the free-to-play category, Social Point continues to outperform our expectations, with net sales from its two biggest games; Dragon City and Monster Legends, growing double-digits in the first quarter. We view Social Point as an important long-term growth opportunity for Take-Two.", "WWE SuperCard also continued to grow with net sales up more than 50% and total downloads now exceeding 15 million. And NBA 2K Online remains the number one PC online sports game in China, with over 35 million registered users. Downloadable add-on content also contributed to the growth in recurrent consumer spending, led by offerings for Sid Meier's Civilization, Mafia III and WWE 2K17.", "We expect fiscal 2018 to be another strong year for Take-Two and we've raised our outlook for net sales and net cash provided by operating activities. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we expect to deliver both record net sales and net cash provided by operating activities led by the launches of Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption 2 and a highly anticipated new title from one of 2K's biggest franchises.", "Today, our industry is only just beginning to realize its vast potential. From the introduction of exciting new hardware platforms to the continued growth of digital distribution, we now have the ability to reach and captivate audiences like never before. In addition, the ways in which consumers engage with interactive entertainment are continuing to evolve, including through mobile devices and the fast-growing world of competitive gaming. Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned, creatively, operationally and financially to capitalize on all of these opportunities and to deliver value to our customers and returns for our shareholders over the long-term.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by providing an update on our recent strategic accomplishments and then review our lineup for fiscal 2018. In May, we further diversified our industry-leading portfolio of owned intellectual property through the acquisition of Kerbal Space Program, the critically-acclaimed physics-based space simulation game. Created by independent developer, Squad, Kerbal Space Program was originally released on PC in April 2015 and has sold over 2 million units to-date. The title has been widely popular with the critics and consumers alike, earning a Metacritic rating of 88 and a Steam user score of 97%.", "In Kerbal Space Program, players must build a space-worthy craft, capable of flying its crew of lovable beings called Kerbals into space. Players who successfully launch their spacecraft can explore their planet's moons and solar system, as well as share their unique creations and advice with a vibrant and growing online community. Kerbal Space Program is currently available solely through digital download for PC.", "The team at Squad will continue to provide support and ongoing development for the title through updates and additional content, including the previously announced Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion, which we'll launch later this calendar year. Since completing the acquisition, sales of Kerbal Space Program outperformed our expectations. We view the brand as a new, long-term franchise that adds a well-respected and beloved IP to our portfolio, as we continue to capitalize on opportunities across the independent development landscape.", "Turning to the exciting and growing world of esports, our team and the NBA remain hard at work on setting the foundation for the launch of the NBA 2K esports league in 2018. The joint venture builds upon the success of our NBA 2K brand and relationship with the NBA to bring together the best basketball gamers in the world, marking the first official competitive gaming league that is jointly owned by a U.S. professional sports league. We are thrilled to expand our presence in competitive gaming and believe that the NBA 2K esports league has the long-term potential to be a meaningful driver of profits for our company.", "I'll now discuss our fiscal 2018 lineup. On September 19, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch NBA 2K18, the latest installment of our industry's number one rated and number one selling basketball series. The title will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Windows PC, and will also be our first offering for the Nintendo Switch. This year, the Cleveland Cavaliers' Kyrie Irving will grace the cover of the NBA 2K18 Standard Edition, while the Toronto Raptors' DeMar DeRozan will be the game's first ever cover athlete, specifically for the Canadian edition.", "In addition, 2016 Hall of Famer and 15-time NBA All-Star, Shaquille O'Neal will be on the cover of the Legend Edition and Legend Edition Gold, which will retail for $99 and $149, respectively. Fans who pre-order the Standard Edition of NBA 2K18 at participating North American retail and online vendors will receive Early Tip-Off Access, ensuring that they receive their copy and in-game bonuses four days early on September 15.", "On October 17, 2K, Visual Concepts and Yuke's will launch WWE 2K18, the newest offering from our popular simulation-based WWE series for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The title will also be available this fall for the Nintendo Switch, marking the first time in five years that the series has been released for a Nintendo platform. WWE Superstar Seth Rollins will be the game's cover athlete and decorated Olympian, WWE Hall of Famer and current RAW General Manager, Kurt Angle, will return to WWE in-ring action virtually for the first time in more than a decade as a bonus character for those who pre-order WWE 2K18 at participating retailers.", "In addition, 2K will celebrate the 15-year career of WWE Superstar John Cena through the limited worldwide release of the Cena (Nuff) Edition, which includes exclusive memorabilia and in-game content. WWE 2K18 will be supported with a series of post-launch downloadable content, including a Season Pass.", "On August 29, 2K and Firaxis Games will release XCOM 2: War of the Chosen, the expansion pack for 2016 award-winning strategy title for Windows PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. XCOM 2: War of the Chosen greatly expands upon XCOM 2's campaign and also includes new enemies, missions, environments and increased depth of strategic game play. In the coming months, 2K and Firaxis Games will release an additional Civilization & Scenario Pack for Sid Meier's Civilization VI that'll introduce two new leaders representing civilizations from Southeast Asia. This content will be available automatically at no extra cost for purchasers of the Civilization VI Digital Deluxe Edition.", "Social Point is also hard at work and has a number of exciting games planned for launch over the next two years. Looking ahead, we have an exceptional development pipeline across our labels, including new releases from our popular series and groundbreaking original intellectual property. In addition, we remain focused on finding new and innovative ways to increase consumer engagement and drive recurrent consumer spending as well as enhance our growth through emerging platforms, business models and geographies. The long-term opportunities for both our company and industry are more exciting than ever.", "I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2018. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and financial outlook are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance.", "As mentioned by Strauss, our fiscal first quarter provided an excellent start to the year. Sales of our offerings exceeded our expectations, due primarily to the continued outperformance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, as well as recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K17.", "Total net sales grew 28% to $348 million. Of this amount, 81% were digitally-delivered net sales, which grew 47% to $281 million as we continued to benefit from growth in recurrent consumer spending as well as our industry's ongoing transition to full game downloads.", "While the operating performance of our business exceeded our expectations, this outperformance was not reflected in our GAAP results for two reasons. First, our better than expected net sales were driven by titles that we are required to defer and, therefore, our GAAP revenues and profits will not benefit from these sales until future periods. And second, because of the better than expected performance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, we recorded higher than forecasted internal royalties, which are calculated using results that are adjusted to exclude the impact of deferrals and, unlike certain other costs of goods sold, are not deferred.", "Turning to some details from our first quarter income statement, GAAP net revenue grew by 34% to $418 million and cost of goods sold increased by 2% to $195 million. Operating expenses increased by 9% to $173 million, due primarily to higher stock-based compensation, reorganization costs, and the inclusion of Social Point, partially offset by lower marketing expense. And GAAP net income increased to $60 million or $0.56 per share, up from a net loss of $39 million or $0.46 per share.", "In the first quarter, we recognized a $16 million (15:12) GAAP tax benefit related to tax deductions from stock compensation expense. These additional tax deductions were due to the increase in our stock price from the date that stock was granted to the dates that it vested. Previously, these excess benefits were recorded in additional saving capital. But new accounting guidelines require that they now be recognized in income tax expense. This benefit had no effect on our management reporting tax rates, which is 22%.", "Now I will review the highlights of our fiscal 2018 financial outlook, starting with the fiscal second quarter. We expect net sales to range from $465 million to $515 million. At the midpoint, this represents 2% growth versus the prior year. The largest contributor to net sales is expected to be NBA 2K18 along with Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $400 million to $450 million and cost of goods sold to range from $194 million to $222 million.", "Operating expenses are expected to range from $185 million to $195 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 14% increase over last year, driven by the inclusion of Social Point as well as higher R&D and stock compensation expense .And we expect GAAP net income to range from $17 million to $27 million or $0.15 to $0.25 per share.", "Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. As a result of a better than expected first quarter operating results and improved forecast for the reminder of the year, we are increasing our outlook for both net sales and net cash provided by operating activities. We now expect net sales to range from $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion, up from our prior outlook of $1.42 billion to $1.52 billion.", "Net sales are expected to be down from fiscal 2017 due to fewer new releases and moderating sales from Grand Theft Auto V, partially offset by growth in sales from NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online, as well as the acquisition of Social Point. We now expect digitally-delivered net sales to grow in the high-single-digit, driven by approximately 30% growth in recurrent consumer spend. The largest contributors to net sales are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online and WWE 2K18.", "We expect the net sales breakdown from our label to be roughly 55% 2K, 39% Rockstar Games and 6% Social Point and other. And we expect our geographic net sales split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We now expect to generate approximately $200 million in net cash provided by operating activities, up from our prior outlook of approximately $115 million. And we plan to deploy approximately $60 million for capital expenditures.", "Although our operating performance is exceeding expectations and we're increasing our fiscal 2018 outlook, we are reducing our forecast for GAAP net revenue and net income. This is due to two factors. First, as a result of the continued success of Grand Theft Auto Online, we've determined that it is necessary to extend the life of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online for purposes of calculating deferral.", "This change has no effect on our net sales, cash flow or management reporting results, but it does extend the period over which we recognize GAAP net revenue. And, second, because of the strong ongoing performance of Grand Theft Auto, we expect to report higher internal royalties, which, unlike certain other cost of goods sold, are not deferred.", "As a result, we announced GAAP net revenues to range from $1.62 billion to $1.72 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $732 million to $781 million. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $770 million to $790 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 17% increase over the prior year, driven by the inclusion of Social Point and higher R&D expense. And we now expect GAAP net income to range from $112 million to $140 million or $1 to $1.25 per share.", "In closing, we are very pleased with the start to fiscal 2018, which is poised to be another strong year for our organization. And we believe that fiscal 2019 will be a record year for both net sales and net cash provided by operating activities which are expected to exceed $2.5 billion and $700 million, respectively. Over the long-term, Take-Two is well-positioned to capitalize on our many exciting opportunities around the world and to generate growth and margin expansion for our shareholders.", "Thank you. Now, I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering such a strong start to the year. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Eric Handler from MKM Partners. Please go ahead.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just in case I didn't miss it, I want to just make one quick question on GTA Online. So the full year is going to be up. First year \u2013 the first quarter was the best quarter ever. Are you assuming that second, third and fourth quarters we see declines or are you sort of begrudgingly admitting this game just continues to grow unbelievably quarter-after-quarter? And then, secondly, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the growth that you're seeing, put some numbers for us \u2013 provide some numbers for us on the NBA 2K digital numbers?", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So, I'll start with GTA Online. And it has really performed unbelievably. Q1 it outperformed. It beat our expectations. And we're heading into Q2. We see that Q2 will also be up over last year. But, for Q3 and Q4, we still have it moderating slightly, but overall will be up for the full year.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Great.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "And then for the NBA information, we haven't given out that level of detail.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Okay. You can't give like a directional number, double-digits or anything along the line?", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Recurrent consumer spending, currently, as you mentioned, was up 54%.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tim O'Shea from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC", "Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. So, by my math, you guys are increasing full year non-GAAP EPS outlook by around 30% to 41% from the outlook that you provided last quarter. So, just given the relatively light release slate, it does seem like this growth is coming from recurrent consumer spending. And I know that Strauss spoke about how GTA Online should grow this year given the record mile levels in June and July and obviously NBA also sounds very strong. But I'd just love to hear your thoughts on what's driving this level of optimism around this non-GAAP EPS outlook. Thank you.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So, for the full year, we are lifting the year due to our Q1 beat and then our improved outlook for the remainder of the year, which is driven by the improved forecast for GTA V, GTA Online, and NBA 2K. And we also increased our marketing expense for certain titles, GTA Online, and some of the rest of the titles that are in our pipeline.", "Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Hey. Good afternoon. I have two questions if I could. First, as we're talking about your GTA Online, obviously it continues to beat expectations. Just curious what if anything do you think could slow it down. Is there a reason to believe that the launch of Red Dead is actually maybe the largest threat to GTA Online engagement? And then second, you mentioned full game downloads exceeded expectations. Can you share what percent of current gen sales were full game downloads and what you would expect that to be by year-end? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "I think four years after its initial release, we're immensely gratified that Grand Theft Auto V continues to sell \u2013 sold in more than 80 million units. And that it looks like Grand Theft Auto Online will have another record year. Beyond that, we're not making any projections. However, we have observed that when Rockstar Games drops additional robust content, people are enthusiastic about playing the game and monetization follows appropriately. And that's kind of how we look at the world.", "In terms of the competitive landscape going forward, look, our view is that all entertainment titles compete against every other possible use of your time. And they don't compete specifically against our games or anyone else's games. They compete against everything, against text messaging, going to the movies, reading a book, doing your work, whatever else can occupy your time. Entertainment is a nice to have, not a must have. However, when there is more than one title in the marketplace that compels people, the market also expands to take advantage of it.", "So, the marketplace can be competitive, but it's rarely directly competitive title-to-title, whether that's a title that comes out under the Take-Two umbrella or any of our competitors or anything else for that matter. That's sort of a roundabout way of saying we're really looking forward to the release of Red Dead Redemption 2. We're really excited and enthusiastic, of course. We don't think that has anything to do at all with how Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto Online will perform.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "In terms of our full game downloads for new consoles, for Q1, we had \u2013 it was at 40% which is higher than usual for us because we were so heavily weighted towards our catalog titles during the quarter. For the full year, we see it being at around 30%.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. A couple questions. I'm just wondering about the online MAUs for Grand Theft Auto relative to the new game sales. So do you see that ratio changing a lot as you sell more units of GTA V and you watch your online users? Is that ratio staying about the same? And is there still a lot of room to grow the online universe based on the game sales? And then the second thing, any updates on Red Dead for next year? And what kind of lessons are you learning from GTA? Can you apply those to the Red Dead Online universe? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Yeah. We haven't given out many statistics in terms of the connection between purchases and users and how that's developed, except, of course, to say that we've experienced another record and expect to have a record result this fiscal year which Lainie gave detail on. I'm sorry, your second question was?", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just any update on Red Dead and how do you think about that online universe given what's going on with GTA?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Yeah. There are no updates apart from our enthusiasm about the release in spring of 2018. And, what Rockstar Games has said is there will be an online component. No more details have been given. We've said, as a company, that our hope and expectation is that all of our significant releases offer consumers an opportunity to stay engaged after the initial release. And it's our belief that if you surprise and delight and excite consumers then monetization can't be far behind. And that's been our experience. Beyond that, we're not giving out any more details.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Group. Please go ahead.", "Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey. Congratulations to everyone over there on the continued success. Two questions. Strauss, love to hear your high level views on exclusive content for the various platforms. And it seems like over the recent past we haven't seen a lot of exclusives. But as app stores and potentially new services become more important, do you think that will change?", "And then, separately, AR versus VR, Strauss, I think, you were correctly skeptical of virtual reality's growth. So far it hasn't done much and I was just wondering what your views are on augmented reality. And then, finally, just definitionally, I consider Borderlands a 2K title. Is that correct or because it's developed by Gearbox, should I not think of it as a 2K title? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So I'll just do the third one, the easiest one. Yes, Borderlands is a 2K title. So it's published by 2K, developed by Gearbox. So that's a quick answer to that question. In terms of platform exclusivities, we don't really focus too much on that. I think for us \u2013 the priority for us is to make sure that our entertainment \u2013 our products are available as widely as possible and as many platforms as possible. There may be specific game-related reasons for us to do a certain level of exclusivity by platform, but there really isn't a strategic focus on increasing or decreasing that going forward.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Hey, Ben. It's Strauss. In terms of the AR versus VR, they're completely different user experiences. And the concerns that I raised regarding VR are not applicable to AR. In order to have an AR experience, you don't necessarily have to be wearing glasses or a headset. You're not burdened by being in a particular location. And the discomfort factor doesn't exist necessarily. And we've already seen a very successful AR title with Pok\u00e9mon Go, a very successful title. And one can talk endlessly about trajectory of that title, how it peaks relatively quickly, separate issue. But I have no skepticism about the possibilities for AR. It's in the hands of developers. Are they passionate about an idea and the idea brought to reality in a spectacular, exciting and compelling way?", "So, I think, there is great opportunity. Remains to be seen if the AR technology itself is what creates the opportunity. This entertainment business that we're in here is a sort of \u2013 is unique in that it's this combination of technology and what that means in terms of game play, character, story and graphics. It's unusual that so many moving parts any given time and the full history of this business since its inception as one piece moves ahead, other pieces move ahead. So, it's pretty hard to predict what will excite consumers. And we don't \u2013 we sitting here today from a corporate point of view don't propose to predict that. But that's what our 2,200 creative folks are in the business of doing and our strategy is to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient. And I think what you're talking about is an innovation. And we're proud of the innovations that our creative teams are focused on every day. So, more to come, but I don't have any skepticism particularly about AR technology.", "Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. Good luck.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ray Stochel from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.", "Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. The first question would be if there is any change to your initial 2019 outlook given the increase in guidance for this year?", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "As I mentioned in my prepared remarks there, we don't have a change. We are reiterating what we said last quarter and net sales above $2.5 billion and cash from operations above $700 million.", "Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Got it. Thanks. And I think you may have mentioned some marketing timing being put back into this year. Is that a timing shift or just additional marketing for your properties that you're trying to taking users for? And then, separately, how are you guys thinking about your mix of marketing, whether that be from social influencers, whether that be from retail or whether that be more media related ad spots? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Yeah. The marketing expense being higher that I mentioned in our new outlook, that is additional marketing for some of our titles.", "Karl Slatoff - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "And in terms of mix of marketing, I think, we are seeing a change in mix. And that's not to say that we don't have the same kind of opportunities we have in the past in traditional marketing, television, outdoor or otherwise. We are obviously seeing more opportunities to be more efficient from a marketing perspective. Social media presents all kinds of new and interesting opportunities for us, but in terms of very significant, meaningful changes that would impact our models or expectations, I would say no.", "Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Got it. Thanks so much, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mike Hickey from The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Congrats on another great quarter. Strauss, I think, you may have touched on this. I'm going to ask anyway. I guess when you look at GTA Online and your record MAU that you're seeing in June and July, I think, you said obviously new content is important. Clearly that seems to be the case in this quarter. So the thinking \u2013 I guess I'm wondering how you sort of balance new content with continued catalog sales. They obviously both seem to be big drivers here, but you would expect, I guess, over time that catalog sales might slow? Then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "One would expect the catalog sales would slow over time certainly. And we also \u2013 when we outlined our expectations for Grand Theft Auto Online for this fiscal year, we felt that sales would moderate. It has not turned out to be the case in the first quarter. We're not expecting it to be the case in the second. But, as Lainie said, we are expecting sales to moderate in the third quarter and fourth quarter, which still yield a record year. And, of course, we have to see how it pencils out. But yes, unit sales of the full game would normally decline over time.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks. The \u2013 and I guess on GTA Online, when you think about sort of the construct of monetization, obviously, record performance here, record now. Is the monies collected just primarily the growth there from increase in player base or are you also seeing some fits maybe in paid conversion rate or ARPU? And, secondarily, I guess when you think about maybe medium to longer-term, where you see the biggest opportunity for the game geography-wise or platform-wise? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "We're not giving out more color in terms of conversion and ARPPU or ARPU on the title except information that we already gave in terms of where the game is going. Rockstar Games has said that there is more content to come for Grand Theft Auto Online and we're excited about that and I think consumers are too. Beyond that, in terms of where the title goes creatively or where any franchise goes creatively, as you know, Mike, we leave those discussions and announcements to our labels.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "All right. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Doug Creutz from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company", "Thanks. When I am thinking about the size of the beat in the quarter and particularly in a quarter where you didn't have any new releases and where you were, I think, seven weeks deep in the quarter when you gave guidance, I'm just trying to wrap my head around. Was there something that just really inflected positively in the back half of the quarter that you didn't expect? Was it more a case of you expect the things to sort of really slowdown in the back half of the quarter and they didn't? And then if you could let us know what your catalog net sales were in the quarter that would be helpful too. Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So, we did have very successful release of the Gunrunning update in the quarter. And that generated a lot of enthusiasm and net sales reflected that enthusiasm. So I think you properly captured that. And in terms of your question regarding catalog, Lainie, you'll take that one.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "The catalog sales are about 94% in the quarter and it's also...", "Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company", "94% of the total.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Yes. So it was $326.2 million of net sales.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from San Phan from Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. I was just curious. As you look ahead to Red Dead, is there any reason that you think that geo mix for that game would change or be noticeably different from what you've seen with GTA or maybe then the last Red Dead game from your prior launch?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "I understand why you're posing a question, given the theme. We had a great worldwide result with the Red Dead Redemption. We expect it will have a similar geographical mix to any titles of that scale. We pride ourselves on our worldwide marketing and distribution organization. The international markets continue to develop for us and for our competitors. We're incredibly excited, for example, about what's going on in Asia where there's a lot of growth. So no, we don't have any reason to believe that geographical mix will differ.", "San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Drew Crum from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Strauss, could you comment on your early expectations for the NBA eLeague? Is that an important piece of the confidence behind next year's guidance for record sales or is it not material? And then, separately, on the pipeline, I think, you mentioned that there are a couple games in development from Social Point will be out over the next two years. Is that \u2013 is anything embedded in fiscal 2018 guidance? And as it relates to Red Dead, any contemplation in making that game available on PC? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Well, let's distinguish our collective enthusiasm for the NBA eLeague from our financial expectations because we've included no results in our outlook from that. And that's again not a reflection of a shortage of interest or enthusiasm. We have plenty of that. But our style around here is that we don't claim victory before it occurs. We work really hard to create something and really diligently to do so. And then we tell you how it goes afterwards candidly.", "For what it's worth, we think it's an amazing opportunity. The NBA is a great partner. Brendan Donohue is doing a fantastic job building a team to exploit the opportunity. We have a schedule coming in 2018. We have 17 teams who are signed-up to participate. But the business model is still uncertain in this space, as I've said before. And there is really only one game in the space that generates a whole lot of revenue right now. And, again, we think there is a wonderful opportunity, but we're not yet at the point where we would include that in our results.", "In terms of Social Point games that are in development, those are included in our outlook. And, as I mentioned, that deal is not very old around here, but it's still already performing much better than our expectations. Net sales were up double-digits in the quarter.", "Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And Red Dead on PC, Strauss, any update there?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Any updates about any of our titles will come from our labels.", "Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Thanks. Congratulations, guys, on a great quarter. So, Strauss and Lainie, when the business was completely physical discs, you were in a position where you had to predict the number of units. So \u2013 but now, you not only have to predict units, but you also have to predict consumer engagement and monetization. So, where the business is now, is it inherently more predictable or unpredictable? So, I guess, another way to ask the question is, as the cycle of new content drops, the rise in engagement and the monetization that follows, is that a pretty predictable business? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "I actually don't think it's any more or less predictable. The vagaries of creative businesses though are well known to all of us. When you're putting out the next iteration in a beloved franchise, generally, as you come to completion between the installed base which the information that we have and the experience we had in the prior release within the franchise, we come pretty close to having a sense (41:39).", "The biggest benefit of a movement to digital, of course, is that we don't have any sort of economic order quantity concerns. We don't have to worry about how many units we produce or overproducing or under-producing because a digital game is always available. There is also an enormous benefit for our catalog because a catalog title that isn't selling a lot of units won't be on shelves or may not be on shelves, but it's always available in digital form. And, finally, of course, our margins both percentage and dollars are higher with digital distribution.", "So this is one of these situations where it's all good news. Perhaps the only bad news, if there is bad news, is obviously when you buy a digital version of a game, you don't have the ability to trade in a used title later. So from a consumer point of view, it could be seen that it's more expensive to buy a frontline title. How do we deal with that? We weren't particularly subject to used gaming sales at all because we pride ourselves in having the highest quality titles in the marketplace.", "People don't like trading in our games typically. So, I think, from this company's point of view, the movement to digital \u2013 which, to be clear, we have no influence over. We need to be where the consumer is. We don't try to order the market. We try to be responsive and be of service to our consumers. However, the movement to digital distribution is definitely a very good thing for our company and for the industry.", "Karl Slatoff - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "And, Stephen, on \u2013 and in terms of engagement, which is kind of code for recurrent consumer spending, again that's not really necessarily a \u2013 has an effect on our predictability. It really is \u2013 that's a factor of extending the life of the product and then maybe commoditize more effectively for a longer period of time. So, when we know we have a hit and we know engagement is high then we can consider that we're going to obviously have better results for a longer period of time. So, it's really not about purchase ability. It's more about how effectively you monetize.", "Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Evan Wingren from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Can you \u2013 two platform questions. I guess just how important is PC as a platform for your major titles on a go-forward basis from maybe a few years ago?", "Karl Slatoff - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So, the answer to that is it really depends on the title. Some titles are actually heavily weighted to PC, for example, Civilization and XCOM. Some titles are less weighted to PC. So, it really depends on a title-by-title basis. The great news is that the PC market is vibrant for us. It's a great market for us. It's a big market. It's a core market in consumers that are highly engaged. It's a predominantly digital market, which also removes friction in terms of ongoing engagement with a consumer. So, for us, the PC market as a company is very important and very exciting and something we focus on.", "Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then, secondarily, obviously, you're supporting the Switch. Can you maybe just give us an idea of how your perspective on that platform has evolved over the past, call it, six months and where you see its potential?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "We were excited six months ago and supportive. We're excited now. We have NBA 2K and WWE 2K coming for Switch. The sales have been great. We expect sales to continue to be great. We're very optimistic around the platform. We're very supportive of Nintendo. So, the only thing that's changed in the last six months is our initial belief, has been reinforced by the early very strong results.", "Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thank you all for joining us. Thanks for your questions. Really appreciate it. We're really pleased with and proud of the results from the quarter. And as always, we appreciate your attention and your support. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Hank Diamond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you. Mr. Diamond, you may begin.", "Henry A. Diamond", "Good afternoon. Welcome and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 ended September 30, 2014. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us.

Please refer to our earnings release for a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation. Our earnings release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that for the ninth consecutive quarter, Take-Two delivered better-than-expected results, which further illustrate our company's continued positive momentum. Key drivers for the period were strong catalog sales led by Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K14, and Borderlands 2, and continued growth in digitally-delivered revenue from our current consumer spending, particularly for Grand Theft Auto Online.", "Grand Theft Auto V remains our company's and industry's standard bearer for creative and commercial excellence. More than a year after its record breaking launch, the title is still captivating new audiences on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and we believe its enduring popularity will grow even stronger when the title makes its November 18 debut on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.", "NBA 2K14 and Borderlands 2 also continue to attract new fans and generate meaningful revenue from our current consumer spending, long after their initial release dates. Their ongoing success underscores the durability of our key franchises and demonstrates that the customers remain engaged with our highest-quality titles for prolonged periods of time and then eagerly return on day 1 to experience each new iteration.", "The diverse array of other titles also contributed to catalog sales during the quarter, including the Grand Theft Auto series, WWE 2K14, Sid Meier's Civilization V, Red Dead Redemption, and BioShock Infinite. Our deep catalog of must-have titles is an important competitive advantage and provides a predictable contribution to our results.", "During the second quarter, $89.8 million of our non-GAAP net revenue was digitally delivered. Importantly, nearly 60% of this revenue was derived from recurrent consumer spending which grew 45% year-over-year. We continue to see strong consumer engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online, which has both exceeded our expectations and has been the single largest contributor to digitally-delivered revenue in every quarter since its launch.", "During the second quarter, Rockstar Games released 2 updates, including The San Andreas Flight School Update and The Last Team Standing Update. The ongoing release of new content for Grand Theft Auto Online keeps consumers immersed in the game's vast open world, and we remain highly enthusiastic about its future, including the upcoming launches on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.", "Recurrent consumer spending for NBA 2K also grew during the second quarter, with revenues up approximately 135% year-over-year. We expect that online play and virtual currency will continue to be important contributors to the success of our industry-leading basketball franchise.", "A variety of other offerings also contributed to recurrent consumer spending in the second quarter, including downloadable add-on content for Borderlands 2 and other titles, NBA 2K online in China, and in-game spending on WWE Supercard, which has been downloaded more than 3.5 million times and has quickly become 2K's most financially successful free-to-play mobile offering.", "Continuing to create opportunities that drive ongoing engagement with our titles after release is a high-margin growth opportunity for our company and a key strategic focus of our teams. We've only scratched the surface when we plan to support our future releases with innovative offerings designed to drive recurrent consumer spending.", "Full game downloads across console, PC and mobile platforms also contributed to digitally-delivered revenue. During the second quarter, we expanded our offerings for tablets and smartphones with the release of BioShock and Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution 2 for iOS. We're committed to providing our products on all relevant platforms, regardless of the screen size; and to all distribution channels, both physical and digitally delivered.", "Our fiscal third quarter is off to an excellent start with one of the strongest and most diverse holiday lineups in the history of our company. The initial response to our recent releases including NBA 2K15, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth, and WWE 2K15 has been outstanding, as Karl will discuss shortly. Through the tireless passion and dedication of our teams, we've been able to accomplish the challenging task of simultaneously delivering 4 AAA titles within a single month, supporting them with world-class marketing campaigns and executing seamless global distribution.", "In doing so, 2K has further exemplified its impressive capacity for growing its business by delivering multiple high-quality products and building leading franchises, and there's more to come.", "As a result of our better-than-expected second quarter performance, strong current business trends and positive outlook, we've raised our revenue and earnings expectations for fiscal 2015, which is on pace to be one of our best years ever. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016 and beyond, we have a robust pipeline of \"yet to be announced\" titles in development, including both groundbreaking, new intellectual properties and new releases from our established franchises, coupled with digitally-delivered offerings designed to drive recurrent consumer spending. Our company is better positioned than ever to continue delivering long-term growth, profits, and returns for our shareholders.", "I will now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Strauss. Today I'll provide an update on our recent releases and lineup for the remainder of fiscal 2015.", "On October 7, 2K launched NBA 2K15 and further cemented the franchise's undeniable legacy as the #1 basketball experience in our industry. Developed by Visual Concepts and available for prior gen, next gen and PC, NBA 2K15 has been lauded by consumer and media for once again raising the bar for sports realism and gameplay. This year's Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions offer a variety of new features, including revolutionary 3D facial scanning, which enables players to put themselves into the game while living the life of a player in MyCAREER, becoming the face of a franchise in MyGM, or playing with friends online in multiplayer modes. Fans of NBA 2K15 also can engage with the game on their tablets and smartphones through the full-featured mobile version and the MyNBA 2K15 companion app. NBA 2K15 has enjoyed the strongest launch in the history of the series, with both record first week selling and sell-through across all platforms, and currently, it is the highest-rated sports game released this year on PlayStation 4 based on Metacritic.com rankings.", "On October 14, 2K released Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. The title is off to a strong start, demonstrating that there's still a vibrant market for must-have prior gen titles.", "In keeping with the franchise's tradition of successfully driving recurrent consumer spending, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel will be supported by 4 action-rich downloadable add-on packs, which also can be purchased together via a Season Pass. Borderlands continues to be one of our company's most popular franchises, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is another great offering for diehard fans and newcomers alike.", "On October 23, 2K hit the ice with NHL 2K for iOS and Android. We are excited to provide hockey fans with a full-featured mobile gaming experience, consistent with our strategy of exploring select opportunities for tablets and smartphones.", "On October 24, 2K expanded the wildly successful Civilization franchise with the release of Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth for PC. The title features the core and tactical elements for which the series is famous, while propelling players beyond the traditional timeline of a Civilization game by exploring humanity's future on an alien world. Civilization: Beyond Earth is off to a great start and has garnered positive critical reception from influential press with Game Informer awarding it a score of 9 out of 10 and declaring the title a worthy bearer of the Civilization name and a must play for strategy fans.", "Yesterday, 2K released WWE 2K15 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and also will bring the title for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on November 18. Developed collaboratively by Visual Concepts and Yuke's. WWE 2K15 offers major gameplay enhancements, improved commentary and a collection of the biggest roster of WWE superstars. For the first time in the history of the series, WWE 2K15 includes MyCAREER mode, a fan favorite from our NBA 2K series, which enables players to experience the life of a rookie WWE Superstar and rise to the ranks to earn a title shot at WrestleMania. The title will also be supported with an exciting array of downloadable content, including a Season Pass. The initial launch of WWE 2K15 is off to an encouraging start, and we expect a combined launch on prior gen and next gen to show meaningful growth versus last year's release.", "I'd like to congratulate 2K and their studios, Visual Concepts, 2k Australia and Firaxis Games as well as our external partners at Gearbox software and Yuke's for delivering a stellar array of titles for this holiday season. Their commitment to excellence is evident within each release, and we are very proud of their contributions to our organization.", "Now I'd like to discuss our upcoming pipeline. On November 4, 2K will release BioShock Infinite: the Complete Edition for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Featuring the award-winning title and all of its previously released add-on content, The Complete Edition provides unprecedented value and is a must-have item for gamers who have yet to experience BioShock Infinite's graphically stunning world, deep and immersive storytelling and heart-pounding action.", "On November 18, Rockstar games will launch their record shattering hit, Grand Theft Auto V on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with the PC version to follow on January 27, 2015. In addition to increased draw distances and higher resolution, players can expect a range of additions and improvements including new weapons, vehicles and activities, additional wildlife, denser traffic, a new foliage system, enhanced damage and weather effects and much more. Players returning from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions will get access to a host of new, exclusive content, including rare versions of classic vehicles from across the Grand Theft Auto series, activities such as wildlife photography, new shooting range challenges, new weapons and more.", "Included with Grand Theft Auto V is free access to Grand Theft Auto Online, which now will feature online play for up to 30 players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The current community of players will have the ability to transfer their Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to their choice of either PlayStation 4, Xbox One or PC. In addition, all content and gameplay created for both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online will also be available for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC with more to come. Rockstar Games will continue to support both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online with new offerings throughout the year, including regular content drops and limited-time event updates.", "Rounding out our fiscal 2015 lineup will be 2K's February 10 launch of Evolve for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. Developed by Turtle Rock Studios, Evolve is the only title in history to win Game of Show honors at both E3 and Gamescom in the same year. Consumer anticipation for Evolve continues to build, and starting tomorrow through November 2, the big alpha test for this unique 4 versus 1 multi-player shooter will be available exclusively for 24 hours on Xbox One. In addition, the alpha test will be available on PlayStation 4 and PC from October 31 to November 2. While the alpha test is not fully representative of the final product, it will give our teams a chance to test the game in the hands of our most passionate consumers. And we will test it again in the open beta for Evolve, exclusively for Xbox One in January. We remain incredibly excited about the potential for Evolve.", "Looking beyond this fiscal year, we have a robust pipeline of titles in development. To date, we have revealed 2K's Battleborn, an all-new intellectual property developed for next gen and PC by Gearbox Software, the creative team behind our Borderlands franchise, which is planned for release during fiscal 2016. The title, which was featured on the August cover of Game Informer, is a blended-genre game that combines first-person shooting, cooperative combat and an expansive collection of characters to deliver an all-new hero-shooter experience. We'll have more to announce about our future lineup in the months to come.", "In closing, I'd like to join Strauss in thanking our global teams for delivering a superb holiday lineup and continuing to executive our proven strategy of creating the most innovative and highest-quality titles in our industry.", "I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review our results for the second quarter and then discuss our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal 2015. All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP results from continuing operations, and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our results for the second quarter. Net revenue was $135.4 million versus $1.27 billion in last year's second quarter, which had benefited from the record-breaking launch of Grand Theft Auto V. This result exceeded our outlook range of $95 million to $110 million due to stronger-than-expected catalog sales and digitally-delivered revenue, particularly from Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto online, Borderlands 2, the WWE 2K franchise and NBA 2K14.", "Digitally-delivered revenue accounted for $89.8 million of net revenue versus $105.5 million last year. Revenue from recurrent consumer spending, including virtual currency downloadable add-on content and online games, grew 45% and accounted for 58% of digitally-delivered revenue. The largest contributor to digitally-delivered revenue were offerings for the Grand Theft Auto series, the NBA 2K franchise, Borderlands 2, and Sid Meier's Civilization V.", "Gross margin increased 19.4 percentage points to 58.6% due primarily to lower internal royalties and a higher percent of digitally-delivered revenues. Operating expenses were $110.3 million, down by $49.2 million, as last year's second quarter included higher-marketing expense for the launch of Grand Theft Auto V.", "Interest and other expense is $2 million, and non-GAAP net loss was $35.4 million or $0.44 per share as compared to net income of $325.6 million or $2.49 per share in fiscal second quarter 2014. This result exceeded our outlook range of a loss of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. On a GAAP basis, we reported revenue of $126.3 million and loss from continuing operations of $41.4 million or $0.51 per share.", "Turning to some key items on our balance sheet at September 30, 2014, as compared to June 30, 2014. Our cash and short-term investments balance decreased to $803.8 million. Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $25.4 million, primarily reflecting the collection of receivables. Inventory increased to $55.9 million due primarily to build up for our October releases and software development costs and licenses increased to $327 million, reflecting the development efforts around our pipeline of upcoming releases.", "Now I will review our financial outlook for the third quarter and fiscal 2015, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. Starting with the full fiscal year, as a result of our better-than-expected second quarter performance, strong current business trends, and positive outlook for our upcoming releases, we are increasing our outlook for both revenue and net income per share. We now expect net revenue to range from $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, up from the prior range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, and net income to range from $1.05 per share to $1.30 per share, up from the prior range of $0.80 to $1.05 per share.", "Turning to the details of our full year outlook. The majority of our revenue is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K15, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, WWE 2K15 and Evolve. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 60% from 2K and 40% from Rockstar Games. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect gross margins in the mid- to upper 40s. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 7%, driven primarily by personnel expense on a higher headcount, higher professional fees and higher depreciation expense.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 17% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $9 million, tax expense is about $44 million, and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 114 million. This reflects weighted average basic shares of approximately 80 million, 8 million participating shares for unvested stock-based compensation awards, and 26 million representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the if-converted method of accounting.", "Interest on the convertible notes, net of tax, is approximately $7.4 million, which should be added back to net income to calculate net income per share under the if-converted method. We expect to generate cash during the second half of fiscal 2015 and a result of our better-than-expected results, increased outlook and cash receipt from the sale of Twitch, we now expect to be approximately net cash flow neutral for the full fiscal year. We continue to expect to generate cash from operations in fiscal 2016.", "Turning to the fiscal third quarter, we expect net revenue to range from $745 million to $760 million, and net income to range from $1.35 to $1.45 per share. The majority of our revenue is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K15, Borderlands: The Pre-SEQUEL, WWE 2K15 and Civilization: Beyond Earth. We expect gross margins in the upper 40s. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 33% from the prior year third quarter, primarily due to higher marketing expense for our holiday releases. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 13% of net revenues based in the mid-point of our outlook range. Our third quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $2 million, tax expense of $32 million, and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 114 million. This reflects weighted average basic shares approximately 80 million, 8 million participating shares and 26 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the if-converted method of accounting.", "Interest on the convertible notes, net of tax, is approximately $1.9 million, which should be added back to net income to calculate net income per share under the if-converted method.", "In closing, fiscal 2015 is poised to be among Take-Two's best years ever. We continue to benefit from top creative assets coupled with a sound financial foundation, which provide our organization the flexibility both to execute our core strategy and to capitalize on new opportunities for growth. We are well positioned to deliver non-GAAP profits every year for the foreseeable future and return to our shareholders over the long term. Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their contributions to our success. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple of questions on GTA V. When you think about the huge player base that's out there, do you think you can get a decent conversion among people to maybe try and buy GTA V? What's kind of your thinking around that? And then could you reiterate or repeat those digital numbers? Did you say half of your digital is coming from GTA V? Just want a clarification on that. And then maybe one for Lainie about the cash. Clearly going to be a year with solid earnings, where are you deploying some of that cash that's not really coming through on the cash flow statement?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Justin. In terms of GTA V, obviously, having sold something like 34 million units of GTA V for what is now a prior gen, we know we're attracting a very significant core gamer audience and we also attracted people who are not core gamers. But we don't think we had 100% market share of everyone who had platforms, and so we do think there's an opportunity for people who haven't yet enjoyed the title to enjoy it for next gen. Equally, when you do go buy a new platform, it seems to me that it would be very exciting to have one of the most important titles in the industry. But we tend to like to talk about this stuff after it's happened not in advance. We're really proud of the lineup we've had. We're immensely proud of the achievements of the Rockstar team for GTA, and we're anxiously awaiting the November release. So we'll see how it goes. And Lainie can answer your question about digital, then I'll pick it back up on cash.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Okay. For digital, we said $90 million for the quarter was in digitally-delivered offerings, and 58% of that came from our recurrent consumer spending, which grew 45%, so we didn't specifically break out what GTA Online was, but that's the information we gave around the digital business.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "And then just in terms of deploying our cash balance, we've said repeatedly that we've used and expect to use cash to support organic growth. It's been a good story on organic growth. In 2007, our apples-to-apples net revenue was roughly $700 million. This year, we're guiding to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Last year was obviously well over $2 billion, and that's all been generated to organic growth. We are risk-averse folks. We don't intend to change that, certainly don't intend to be profitable yet. But we do see growth opportunities that we now have the ability to avail ourselves of, especially as we head into what we believe will be a very significant growth periods driven by these new consoles coming online. Secondly, we said we will contemplate accretive acquisition or inorganic growth. We've been very selective in anything that we've done so far. And thankfully, it's all worked out for us. But that is something we can now contemplate, but I want to emphasize that we're only interested in accretive deals, and I mean accretive within a reasonable period and accretive on a mathematical basis, not just a business model basis. And finally, we've shown a willingness to return cash to the shareholders. We have very meaningful stock buyback last year, that's another opportunity as well. So minimally, there are 3 possible uses. I think it's also worth noting in our business, cash is a strategic asset. Like any entertainment business, there's an element of risk and volatility in our business that we've aimed very much to drive that out. We definitely have a much more predictable and much less volatile business than we used to have years ago. But having a meaningful amount of cash does allow one to play through the inevitable ups and downs of our business and to avail ourselves of opportunities when they do arise.", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Maybe one follow-up. Why would cash earnings be below operational earnings this year? Just trying to reconcile the difference between the cash flow statement and the income statement just for this year. It looks like kind of a difference between the 2 this year.", "Lainie Goldstein", "It's definitely a buildup of our development cost on our games and our strong pipeline going forward, that's what's causing the difference.", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So growth in software development on the balance sheet?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes. Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the state of retail right now as we sort of get closer to holiday season. Are you finding that retailers are having a willingness to take on physical inventory? And are you seeing any skittishness as sort of the -- as consumers sort of steadily migrate to more full game downloads?", "Karl Slatoff", "It's Karl. We've actually seen a very robust retail market, and all of our retail partners have been enthusiastic about our titles. So to the extent there's any skittishness in the market, and we've had heard rumblings of some of it, we haven't seen any of it at this point. So we're very sanguine on what the state of the market is. And frankly, there's nothing that we've been told by any of our partners that give us any significant concerns. So we think it's going to be a fantastic holiday season, and we're incredibly excited about the lineup that we have, which is a much bigger lineup than we're used to having at the time of the year. So we feel good.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just one follow-up for Lainie. It looks like operating expenses came in a little bit lower than expected. Anything going on in there in terms of were those reallocated or maybe some permanent taking out of the business, or just talk a little bit about that.", "Lainie Goldstein", "In Q2, what we saw in operating expenses was a little bit lower in terms of our marketing expense and it was some timing. So most of that marketing we'll see in the rest of the year in Q3 and Q4.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.", "Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "I wonder if you could comment on the decision to push GTA V on PC back to January and any impact that has on your guidance. And then separately, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, could you comment on how it sold or what the selling look like relative to Borderlands 2? And then, I have a follow-up.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "When we move a title, it's almost always the same answer, which is giving a title a bit more development time to make sure that it can be everything that it ought to be, and while we would prefer never to change release dates, it's proven to be a good move for us in general because we have the highest Metacritic ratings in the business, and that correlates with revenue and ultimately, of course, profitability. In terms of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, naturally it's available only for what is now prior gen. It's not available currently for next gen. We're very happy with the initial results. It remains to be seen. It's early days yet but you wouldn't want to comp it to the last Borderlands. So I don't think that would be an appropriate comp right now.", "Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Fair enough. And then, just last question, Strauss, as far as fiscal '16 is concerned, you've made reference a couple of times to the \"robust pipeline,\" you've got some momentum with digital, and you expect to be net cash flow positive next year. Can you -- is it too early to comment on growth prospects for next year? How comfortable are you that the business can grow versus 2015?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We feel good about the place the industry is in. And I put Take-Two to decide for the moment. This has historically been an excellent time for the business. And a couple of our important peers are performing, and it made pretty good announcements of late. The early stages of the launch of new hardware historically has been a very good thing for the interactive entertainment business, and this time around appears to be no exception. To the contrary, it looks like it's going to be a very robust period in terms of initial selling. The key competitors whose strategies make sense, who have strong balance sheets, who have strong-owned intellectual property and strong technical abilities, and we put ourselves on that short list, should be very well positioned, but we're not the only ones. We've given as much color as we can on 2016, a much more color than we used to give, frankly. We don't have much more to add now. And as we have marketing announcements, of course, our labels will make them. But sitting here today, we feel -- obviously, because we've increased our financial outlook for this year, we feel very sanguine about this fiscal year. And again sitting here today, we feel as though '16 is unfolding nicely as well. But it's early yet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.", "It seems interesting to me that 2 of the biggest games out this holiday are actually upgrades of prior games. One, of course, is yours in GTA V coming to next gen and the other is Halo, being rereleased in all of the series for at least one of the next gen consoles. And so I'm wondering is that a treatment of other games in your deep catalog that you think are appropriate to migrate up to next gen and be rereleased but upgraded. And then to the Halo thing it's interesting in that it's repackaged the entire story into kind of one game. And is that something you might consider for GTA given the deep history of that game, not just GTA V, but all the way back the last decade or so? And then two, also on GTA, wondering if you could comment on what percentage of the people that have bought the game are still engaged with the game, either offline or online. And in the online component, what percentages of those online players are also payers?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, in reverse order, appreciate the question. This quarterly report continues to reflect that the Grand Theft Auto online has been a significant contributor to our results and obviously, we repeatedly said that we're gratified by how the title is performing, both the full game release as well as the online component, and we've been gratified by the long-lasting nature of that. But beyond that, we haven't given out much more data, and I don't see us doing that right now either. In terms of the kind of titles we put out, and I understand your question, in any given year, we and our key competitors launch new intellectual properties and new iterations of older properties. And occasionally, when we see a platform shift, we will take an old property and create an iteration of that in a very similar form for next gen, and we wouldn't rule anything out. That would be driven by the market opportunity we perceive and the potential for delivering a quality release, and that would be very much something that'd also be driven by the passion of our labels. It would not be something that we would mandate to our labels. Our labels are driven by the desire to delight consumers and pursue their creative passions, and that's been a formula that's worked extraordinarily well for this company for the past 7 years. So we're not -- we don't have a policy answer to it, except our job around here is to make sure that consumers are thrilled, to deliver the very best titles in the marketplace, and to make sure that for the top creative talent in the industry, this is the #1 place to work.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie.", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "A few questions. Strauss, when you're talking about Rockstar, some investors still think it's just GTA. So wondering if you could walk through some of the other key Rockstar franchises and comment on what they mean to Take-Two. And also, can you tell us if there's any new IP that is being developed by Rockstar, or is everything in the pipeline based on existing IP? And then coming at the GTA next-gen question a little differently, can we get a sense of what it looks like in your guidance versus the original launch? Does the guidance assume it's 10% as big, 20% as big, 30%, et cetera? And then, just finally, when you're looking at potential acquisitions, are you primarily looking to buy something very much directly related to video games? Or are you looking more broadly at media?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "So Ben, let me take your first and your third, then I'm going to ask you to repeat your second after I've done that because you were speaking quickly, and I'm slow on the uptake. In terms of Rockstar, as you know, I think you know as well as anyone other franchises include Red Dead, which has been massively successful for our -- for Rockstar and for our company, the Midnight Club franchise, Max Payne and numerous other titles. In terms of what Rockstar is working on in any given time, we really want our labels to make announcements and focus on the consumer and marketing, and that's something that you'd hear from Rockstar when the time is right. In terms of acquisitions, the interactive entertainment business is the only growth business in the audiovisual entertainment business. And there are areas to that business to which we currently do not have exposure, so there's plenty of opportunity out there. But we don't rule anything out, as long as it fits with the company's DNA, as long as it's high quality and clearly would have to be digitally focused entertainment. And I'm sorry, could you repeat your second question for me.", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "Yes. Just relating in the guidance, are you assuming that GTA V is 10% as big as the original launch or 20% as big, or what number should we be thinking about that?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We're not giving out details on a title-by-title basis of our assumptions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes of the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "You announced that the closed alpha of Evolve, and we've seen these closed alphas more frequently now. So just kind of wondering what kind of pre-order brand lift do you generate out of these things. Or is it more about benchmarking and scaling, the online multi-player pieces or monitoring engagement? And then, at the margin, does it drive more digital purchases versus retail purchases?", "Karl Slatoff", "Brian, it's Karl. I think definitely more of the latter in terms the reason why we do this. It's really more to test the game out, to understand -- get some consumer feedback and to make sure the game is working properly, so that we can adjust our development efforts as we see fit. There may be an incremental marketing benefits to it, but frankly, that's not the primary reason that we would do something like that. It really is purely on the development side. In terms of skewing towards digital, we really haven't done an awful lot of these, really if any. So we don't really have any -- a lot of first-hand experience in terms of is it going to skew for digital. I suppose you can make an argument that when you engage people in that way, they're already predisposed to downloading something digitally because that's the way it's typically available. You could make that argument. But how it plays out, it's frankly, we really don't care, because we don't care how people get it. We don't care if they download it. We don't care if they get it on a disk. It doesn't make a difference to us.", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "And then, maybe one quick one. You pointed a broad strength across all platforms of NBA 2K. Any comments on the traction differentiation across the platforms? Or does it kind of correspond to market share? And when you mentioned the Amazon devices, any early traction you see in there with respect to gaming? And Android NBA 2K, is that exclusively on Amazon Android, because you specifically call out available on iOS and Amazon devices?", "Karl Slatoff", "Okay. In terms of strength across the platforms, the good news is we're having strength in NBA across all of our platforms. And in terms of weight between platforms, I don't think we're seeing anything terribly different than we've seen before. So the good news is, is that we feel good across all the platforms. I'm sorry what was the other question?", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "It's just on -- with respect to NBA 2K, you call out availability on iOS and Amazon devices. That's not exclusive to Amazon Android, right?", "Karl Slatoff", "Those are the only 2 platforms that we've announced anything or that they're on at this point. So we haven't talked about other platforms it may or may not be on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets.", "Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just to follow up a little bit. Karl, I know you don't care necessarily how the devices or the games are delivered, but can you give us a sense as to what sort of change you're seeing in terms of the digital distribution of full game downloads relative to what you've seen in prior cycles? And then, also can you guys just follow up a little bit as to what status is with some of the non-partnerships you got going on in Asia?", "Karl Slatoff", "In terms of digital -- in terms of the strength of digital distribution, obviously, digital distribution is incredibly strong, continues to be strengthened in the PC market for us. It's a very, very, very important component of that market, and we continue to see growth in that particular segment. In terms of console, we're seeing strength across the board digitally and also on from a physical side. And in terms of is it -- are we getting more digital? I would say that certainly there's more digital activity at this point, but it's not something that we see is changing in a rapid fashion that's worth noting at this point.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "And in terms of China, things are going well. NBA 2K China online continues to perform well. We continue to be optimistic about Civilization coming, and we're excited.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Larry Haverty with GAMCO.", "Lawrence J. Haverty - Gabelli Multimedia Trust Inc.", "I just have a couple of questions. One, do you have a strategy with regard to removing the convert? Are you going to force conversion at the first opportunity? And could you walk us through what that is or just let it sit there so that people who want to own equities can show that they're owning bonds?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, one of our -- the most recent -- the earliest convert is going to be up in 2016. So it doesn't really seem to make sense right now for us to do anything about that until that time. But we continue to look at it and see if there's an opportunity to make any changes in our capital structure.", "Lawrence J. Haverty - Gabelli Multimedia Trust Inc.", "Okay. And second thing is, do you have any view on what the marketing plans are for the next gen systems from Sony and Microsoft for the fourth quarters? It's been reasonably silent. And so far, it looks like the next gens are selling quite well. But I'm just interested in any insights that you might have on what the game-box guys are actually doing to get more of these products into consumer hands.", "Karl Slatoff", "Larry, we agree that -- we are very encouraged by the sales of next gen -- of next-gen devices. Things are going really, really well. I know that everyone is expecting a very hot season this year. In terms of specific marketing plans, we really don't know any more than you guys do, what they publicly announced. We know that Microsoft has announced a pricing change, which should certainly benefit the installed base on that platform. But in terms of specific plans, that's something that we don't know.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I have a more general question for you guys. In the past, we've all looked at preorders as a good predictor of success for games. With more stuff happening digitally, more full game downloads, et cetera, I'm wondering if -- how you are thinking about games as you develop them. What do you monitor? Is it social media, chatter? Is there other things, particularly with something like Evolve? How are you thinking about that? And then, I'm going to have a follow-up.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. I mean, presales tend still to be a pretty good leading indicator. Awards, covers, press, social media and the like can also be good indicators. And we do have market research to track that as do our competitors. So with social media, there's a bit more insight than there used to be. And I would say, we have pretty good sense of that. We also need to because retail is our partner and we need to make sure that what we're willing to ship is a reflection of what we think the demand is.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I guess what I was trying to figure out is preorders are still the #1 way that you are trying to figure out the potential for a game at this point?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Not really. I mean, they definitely will tell us something about launch quantities, but they don't tell us all that much about lifetime. But Metacritic ratings, for example, which you obviously don't know until after you've established your launch quantities, can tell you something about that. So I would say that preorders are important in terms of launch for many titles, not all. There are titles that have long tail. Our Civilization titles tend to have a very long tail. In other instances, it can tell you a great deal. But you want to see how the title rates and then generally speaking, how consumers like it after it's in the market to get a sense of your lifetime sales.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then my other question is a follow-up on the full game downloads question. I know that Karl mentioned that it's not really material yet. Some of the competitors are talking about 10% to 15% of volume going through digitally. When you think about GTA V, do you think that you would be thinking about, for planning purposes, something like that? Or just wondering how you think about it.", "Karl Slatoff", "Arvind, it's Karl. Just to clarify, I didn't say it wasn't material. I actually said we just didn't care. So there's a pretty big difference there. Whether it's download, a full game download or on a disk, it's irrelevant to us. But you can pretty much assume that we're experiencing the same kind of numbers as everybody else because it's kind of an industry phenomenon. It's not a company-specific or even -- it can be a title-specific phenomenon, but certainly not company-specific phenomenon. But the point is that it doesn't matter to us. In terms of our expectation about percentage digitally downloaded for GTA, we wouldn't share that with you. And again, it's not something that we really focus on to begin with.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We want to be wherever the consumer is. And we have said that our margins on digital distribution are a bit higher. They are for the industry as well. But in terms of margin dollars, there's a bit of a difference in our favor, but not much. But we can't control that. What we can control is making sure that we're ubiquitous, that we're wherever the consumer is. And our belief is that's our job and we can vote, the consumer votes. So that's our job to just make sure that the options are available.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.", "Neil A. Doshi - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "You guys launched mobile games like NBA 2K15 for iOS? Do you feel like that these games are bringing new people to the franchise? Or are you primarily getting people who own the console version and just wanted an opportunity to continue to engage and play with these games when they're kind of away from the console? And then, Lainie, on the gross margins, I think that's the highest we've seen to date. Any thoughts on where kind of gross margins could go long term especially as digital continues to ramp up and become more important part of your revenue mix?", "Karl Slatoff", "Neil, it's Karl. I would say -- to answer your first question about NBA mobile, I would say that it's both. There are people who are engaged specifically with the mobile titles and there are people who are engaged with both, with the console title and use the mobile titles in a companion fashion. And some of our mobile releases are actually designed to be companions to the console, but not necessarily tethered to or specifically required in order to play. So the answer to your question is both. And we also experienced the same thing at WWE. We have WWE Supercard, which is one of our most successful mobile releases from 2K to date, which you can play on a standalone basis but also has some connections into the console game. So it really is both.", "Lainie Goldstein", "In terms of the gross margin, for this quarter, we saw a bit of a higher margin based on our recurrent consumer spending being a big part of the business in the quarter. And then, for the full year, we said we're going to be mid- to upper 40s for the year, and that's also been driven by our recurrent consumer spending that's becoming a bigger part of our business this year, and we hope to see that going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So Strauss, I think you've consistently said before, and correct me if I'm wrong, or putting words in your mouth, but your willingness to take some of your existing franchises global will be low cost and probably deliberate and careful. But given that you are alluding to what appears to be a traction with NBA 2K in China, and that has been in the market for some time now, has that changed your attitude or willingness to step up the risk curve a little bit and perhaps speed up the process of taking your content to the global audience?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Well, our content is already available to the global audience. We have direct distribution into the far corners of the world. And it's one of the things that we're most proud of. Our titles are available virtually everywhere. And of course, there are limitations in China, although that market may well be opening up also. As you probably know, consoles are launching there. There's still going to be significant content restraints, but we think there potentially are some opportunities. If you're referring to other forms of our franchises like NBA 2K Online and Civilization, selectively, we absolutely would like to pursue those, and we are somewhat less risk-averse than we used to be partially based on the success we've enjoyed and partially based on the balance sheet we now have. But this remains a very, very disciplined management team. We operate in a risky business, the entertainment business. And what makes this company work is that, more often than not, we deliver a hit. We have an exceedingly high -- hit ratio. What makes this company work is that we have the strongest creative talents in the business, working on the best collection of owned-intellectual property, delivering the highest-quality products in the business according to Metacritic for, I think, the last 6 years in a row. Those things are all important, and they're easy for me to talk about and really, really hard for our teams to accomplish, really hard. And we have to wake up every day and do it all over again, and we never ever take it for granted. We do not believe it's owed to us. And it comes based on the dedication of more than 2,500 people who work at this enterprise around the world. So easy for me to say, easy for us to brag about, really hard to do every day, really important to do every day. And as we do more and more of that, we have the opportunity, very, very judiciously to take on a bit more risk, build our enterprise, And that's what's helped us grow this company organically from some $700 million in net revenue, just really what was a few short years ago. And we aim to grow profitably on an ongoing basis. But saying those words and doing the job are 2 very different things, and we're exceedingly mindful of risk, and we see ourselves as very careful stewards of our shareholders' capital, and that's not going to change.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Well, briefly, we've spoken an awful lot today. Thanks for all the questions. Thanks for your attention. And we'd like to wish you all a happy and healthy and prosperous holiday season.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our teleconference for today.

Today we'll review our financial results for the first quarter, discuss operating highlights, our upcoming product lineup and initial guidance for the second quarter. We'll provide our insights into the economy's ongoing challenges and uncertainties and how we remain focused on driving toward continued success.", "Take-Two's first quarter results were somewhat better than the initial guidance we provided in December. That said, we were not satisfied to report a significant loss. We expect this quarter's loss to represent the low point of our fiscal year and we're maintaining our prudent outlook and previously stated 2009 guidance. ", "The interactive entertainment industry enjoyed significant growth in 2008 and performed better this holiday season than many other consumer sectors. We still believe, though, that entertainment isn't immune to economic downturns that our industry will be negatively affected in 2009. It's likely the consumers of interactive entertainment will continue to spend cautiously and retailers will also remain challenged in their ability to stock their shelves with the same level of inventory as in previous years. ", "Our strategy has been to release only a select number of triple-A titles that are internally owned and developed and to enhance our release schedule with a few top quality licensed brands. We're confident that this continues to be the right strategy for our business. ", "I want to reiterate that we believe we're extremely well positioned in all facets of our business to manage effectively through these challenging times. Now I'll turn the call over to Ben, who'll provide more detail about first quarter results, operations, products and our road map for the balance of the year.", "Benjamin Feder", "", "Thanks, Strauss. Q1 sales were led by the continued success of Grand Theft Auto IV, Carnival Games, NBA 2K9, Midnight Club Los Angeles and various catalog titles. Today we reported net revenue for the quarter of $256.8 million compared with $240.4 million for the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP net loss was $39.3 million or $0.52 per share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $30.3 million or $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2008. And we ended the first quarter with $218 million in cash. Our cash position net of debt was $148 million. Lainie will provide further details about the quarter.", "I'd like to take a moment to discuss some of our recent business highlights. We released The Lost and Damned, our first downloadable episode for Grand Theft Auto IV exclusively on Xbox LIVE. The episode received critical acclaim from the media and eclipsed first day revenue for all previous downloadable content on Xbox LIVE. With The Lost and Damned we set new benchmarks for innovation and made significant contributions to the evolution of this high margin platform. The digital distribution of such a substantial piece of content is a new opportunity for us, and we're pleased with the profitability of this product and believe that downloadable content will continue to be an important part of our business going forward.", "Last week 2K Sports launched Major League Baseball 2K9 across multiple platforms, featuring their new cover athlete National League Cy Young award winner Tim  Lincecum of the San\u00a0Francisco Giants.

At the same time, we recognize that in this economic environment consumers' decisions are driven by both quality and value. We see the market as being barbell shaped, with triple-A titles at the one end and value products at the other. We're extremely well positioned at both ends. ", "We have triple-A titles - for this season alone we have BioShock 2, Red Dead Redemption and Mafia\u00a02, which are on the leading edge of technology and game play - and we serve the value and family markets with our catalog titles and the products distributed by Jack Of All Games, as well as our family titles offered by 2K Play. ", "The current phase of this hardware cycles places greater importance on catalog titles. Take-Two's track record of developing triple-A titles means that over time we're adding strong products to our catalog to generate higher margins, provide incremental visibility to our business, and reduce volatility in our top line. We've been seeing growth in our catalog sales year-over-year, including this most recent quarter, where catalog sales increased over 30%. ", "We've restructured Jack Of All Games for better efficiencies and margins, as well as make that unit more central to the company's core business. Jack continues to play an important role in our ability to serve the value market. And we're working at the same time to strengthen our sales operations.

We've made more progress in this region and have been aggressively pursuing business development and distribution opportunities that will leverage our existing portfolio as well as capitalize on market-specific initiatives that will appeal to these consumers. Our Asia business increased by nearly 50% in the first quarter compared to last year.", "While triple-A titles are the foundation for our business, the underlying engines and technologies behind those games make it all come together to create our great IP. Across our development studios we've made significant investments in creating proprietary tools and technologies that allow our teams to create multiple top titles on a cost-effective basis throughout a given hardware cycle. This tends to result in cost savings and reduced development times.", "An example of this is the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine or RAGE, which greatly enhances our ability to create powerful open world experiences on the current generation of consoles. 2K has also created proprietary game engines for their sports titles, which are increasingly valuable as they have much shorter development cycles to create on their annual releases. Similarly, our 2K Czech studio has used proprietary state-of-the-art game engines and tools to deliver highly immersive game play experiences, including the upcoming Mafia 2. We will continue to leverage these investments in technologies that help us maintain and strengthen our competitive edge in the market.", "Now moving on to our pipeline for the balance of 2009, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars will be coming to Nintendo DF next week on March 17th.

I'd like now to turn the call over to Lainie. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "", "Thanks, Ben, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll review our first quarter results and then discuss our outlook for Q2 and fiscal 2009. ", "Net revenue was $256.8 million in the first quarter compared with $240.4 million a year ago. Non-GAAP net loss is $39.3 million compared to non-GAAP net loss of $30.3 million last year, the non-GAAP loss per share of $0.52 compared to non-GAAP loss per share of $0.41 last year. Our press release provides a complete reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers. ", "We are pleased that this is the seventh quarter in a row that we have met or exceeded our guidance. The quarter's revenue drivers were Grand Theft Auto 4, Carnival Games, NBA\u00a02K9 and Midnight Club Los Angeles. ", "There were several factors that led to our results exceeding guidance. A variety of our titles performed better than expected. Our catalog business is also very strong, representing approximately 45% of our publishing revenue in the quarter. Our catalog sales include some of the bestselling titles on the prior generation platform as well as current end software. Our distribution revenue also exceeded our expectation, although it was down compared to last year as we had forecast on our last earnings call. ", "On the expense side, our marketing spend was a bit lower than we had forecast, primarily due to the timing of some advertising campaigns, and we also realized a foreign exchange gain of nearly $4\u00a0million which flowed through the interest and other income line.", "Our GAAP results for the first quarter were a net loss of approximately $50 million or $0.56\u00a0per share compared with a net loss of $38 million or $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2008. Our GAAP results this year included $6.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and a total of $4.9\u00a0million of professional fees and expenses related to unusual legal matters. ", "In looking at our consolidated results, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 22%, about flat with last year. While we had a more favorable publishing mix compared to last year, our gross margins this quarter were affected by higher internal royalty expense and price protection. ", "Excluding our sports and distribution businesses, our split between North America and international revenue was about 50/50 compared to 65% to 35% last year. In fact, our international publishing business excluding Sports grew over 90% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately $97 million, which is up from last year's first quarter primarily due to the following reasons:", "Sales and marketing expenses accounted for the largest increase, with a majority due to marketing for Midnight Club Los Angeles and Grand Theft Auto 4. ", "R&D expenses increased with a continued investment in our development studios, including the three studios we opened or acquired last year, and an increase in production expenses. ", "Our interest and other line includes the $4 million foreign exchange gain I mentioned earlier offset by interest expense related to the drawdown on our credit facility. ", "Our tax expense is a quarterly estimate based on our projected expense for the year which primarily reflects earnings in our international territory. ", "Moving on to our balance sheet, at the end of Q1 we had $218 million in cash, including $70\u00a0million from borrowings on our credit line. Cash was used in the quarter primarily for inventory purchases, product manufacturing costs, internal royalties, incentive compensation and advertising during the holiday season. ", "Our accounts receivable reserve was about $63 million at the end of the quarter, which represented approximately 51% of gross receivables. The reserve percentage is higher than historical levels primarily due to increased levels of price protection and bad debt reserves required in the current economic environment. ", "Inventory at the end of the quarter was approximately $76 million, down slightly from this time last year. This is a direct result of our focus on reducing the number of SKUs and inventory level at Jack Of All Games to maximize margins in the business.", "Software development costs and licenses were down year-over-year. We amortized a significant amount of software development costs during 2008 as a result of our [Q] releases and have also capitalized costs related to our upcoming releases. We currently have 29 titles in various stages of development.", "Now to our outlook. We are reiterating the fiscal 2009 guidance that we provided during our Q4 call in December which reflected a challenging economic condition and our heavily backend-loaded year. While we exceeded our first quarter guidance, we maintained our full year estimates due to the continued uncertainty in the economy, a reduction in unit projections for some of our titles, as well as some movements in our lease schedule.", "As we said in our last earnings call, maintaining our release schedule is critical to achieving our fiscal year numbers. Our results may also be affected by variability in foreign exchange rates, which have been very volatile in the past several months.", "For the full year we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of breakeven to $0.20, $1.1\u00a0billion to $1.25 billion in revenue. This excludes stock-based compensation expense of $0.25\u00a0per share and expenses related to unusual legal matters of $0.10 per share. As outlined in our press release, this also excludes stock-based compensation expense of $0.10 per share related to the potential issuance of approximately 2.8 million shares to certain employees of Rockstar Games that is subject to the approval of our 2009 stock incentive plan at our annual stockholder meeting in late April.", "We provided the key assumptions underlying our fiscal 2009 guidance on our last conference call. Those assumptions are still valid today, with just a few exceptions. We now expect our overall revenue mix to be about 75% from publishing and 25% from distribution. The mix of our publishing business will vary slightly from what we previously forecasted. We now anticipate about 40% from Rockstar and 60% from 2K. The 60% from 2K breaks down as follows:  25% from 2K Sports, 25% from 2K Games, and 10% from 2K Play. ", "We now expect our tax expense to be approximately $11 million in 2009 based on the mix of our business. Our estimates reflect tax expense primarily attributable to the geographical mix of our business. ", "We are also issuing initial guidance today for the second quarter, which is provided on a nonGAAP basis. We expect a non-GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.20 on $200 to $220\u00a0million in revenue. This excludes share-based compensation expense of $0.07 per share and expenses related to unusual legal matters of $0.01 per share. ", "Let me provide some additional data points in our Q2 outlook. We expect our revenue mix to be about 75% from publishing and 25% from distribution. We have several new releases in Q2. We have released The Lost and Damned, the first episode for Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360, and Major League Baseball 2K9 on multiple platforms. We'll be releasing downloadable content from Midnight Club Los Angeles on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 shortly. Next week we launch Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars on DS, and at the end of the month we have Don King Boxing for Wii and DS. The remainder of our Q2 business is expected to come from catalog sales of our second quarter of releases. ", "We expect gross profit margins in the mid 30s in Q2, reflecting a significant improvement from our gross margin of 22% in Q1. There are several different factors affecting gross margin. We will recognize deferred revenue in the quarter related to The Lost and the Damned episode. The new Rockstar royalty plan also went into effect beginning in Q2, which is a profit sharing arrangement. Based on our forecast, this should result in higher margins in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these factors, we expect to have a relatively high contribution of distribution revenue in the Sports business in the quarter. ", "We expect overall operating expenses to trend down fairly significantly in Q2 as compared to Q1. Sales and marketing expenses should be down about 10% in absolute dollars based on a smaller number of releases. We expect several million dollars of G&A reductions as a result of our cost-cutting initiatives and the positive impact from foreign exchange rates on our international costs. R&D expenses are also expected to decrease by several million dollars in Q2. Depreciation and amortization should remain about flat. We expect to show a provision for taxes in Q2 primarily related to our international business. ", "Looking to the rest of the year, we're focused on continuing to drive costs out of our business while delivering our strong lineup of titles planned for the fall. ", "Now I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Lainie. I'd like to close by reiterating that we're committed to offering the best home for top creative talent, setting new benchmarks with triple-A products, making strategic investments for growth, prudently managing our business and maintaining our sound financial position.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company", "", "I was wondering if you could maybe comment on where the preorders for GTA Chinatown Wars are? How do they compare maybe to the PSP GTAs that you released in the last several years? ", "Benjamin Feder", "Doug, we don't generally release preorder information. The company itself doesn't have a ton - or Rockstar, say, doesn't have a ton of experience on the DS platform in terms of how it's performed against other titles. I will say that I personally have high hopes for the title. I think it's going to do well, but I don't want to get in front of the release. ", "But we tend not to give out information on preorders. Sorry.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation.", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "", "I've got a couple of questions, some of them related to GTA. I wonder, Lainie, could you tell us what percentage of published revenue came from GTA in the quarter?", "Lainie Goldstein", "For GTA 4 and the entire catalog of GTA, for the whole franchise we had about $60\u00a0million in sales for the quarter, which was about 40% of publishing sales.", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "And I ask you this every time but now that it's coming up here let me try it again. So when you book the revenue from the downloadable version of The Lost and Damned, can you give us a sense of what the P&L looks like? Is there a contribution margin past a certain amount or how can we think about the operating leverage potential of that? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, as we've mentioned before, JT, we can't go into too many specifics due to the confidentiality of the agreement, but we can tell you generally that we'll be recognizing some deferred revenue and it will be paired with some capitalized software amortization and some associated marketing expenses. And the title will also be subject to the new Rockstar royalty plan and any revenue we recognize from Microsoft will be net of any of their royalties.", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "And then you mentioned that the reception was good relative to other downloadable content. I wonder if you could tell us how many downloads there have actually been?", "Benjamin Feder", "We're not announcing that any more than we announce for specific products. We only announce retrospectively very selectively the number of units sold. It was, however, announced by Microsoft to be the biggest first day of downloadable content. It got terrific critical acclaim. Obviously, it's continuing to sell. As Lainie mentioned, it's a profitable title and we're thrilled not just because it's a terrific piece of interactive product. We're also thrilled because I think it signals the beginning of the next phase in our industry. And for a company that focuses on tripleA titles, the notion that we'll put out an initial release and have an opportunity selectively and in a high quality way to follow that up with downloadable content is something that we said we wanted to do and something we said we would do.", "You know, JT, one of the key elements of our strategy is to be the most innovative company in the business and we've talked a lot about that, and this is an innovation and it's being led, as it should, by Rockstar, a label that's known for innovation and quality.", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "And then in terms of the Rockstar, all the human resources you have deployed on JTA, I wonder if you could give us any sense as to how many of those folks are working on Episode 2, how many of those folks are working on the next major iteration of GTA 4 - let's call it GTA 5 or whatever you guys are going to call it - and the number of folks working on new platforms like DS or other things maybe.", "Benjamin Feder", "We don't give out that kind of detail in terms of where our resources are being placed. I will tell you that Rockstar's obviously working on an array of upcoming titled - Red Dead Redemption, episodic content for Midnight Club Los Angeles, Beaterator, which is coming out - there are a lot of terrific titles coming out, so stayed tuned. But we do not parse that by individual folks on particular titles.", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "What's driving Asia? That number was up so much. Anything in particular?", "Benjamin Feder", "Asia was an effort that we embarked on almost immediately after we got here. I continue to believe that emerging markets generally are probably the first to come out of this economic malaise. I think Asia in particular was an area that I felt like was a hole in our distribution footprint. ", "We went ahead and hired Hubert Larenaudie, a Frenchman who comes to us from EA. He's done a terrific job extending our relationships in Asia, working our catalog, working our front line releases. GTA 4 for the PC in this particular quarter helped drive some of those revenues, but I think he built a terrific team out there and I expect great things out of Asia in the future. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "", "First on the subject of downloadable content, can you give us a little bit of color how you see that going forward, whether that's an update to packaged media software or is that a stand-alone software release venue for you?", "And then secondly, looking across your pipeline for the year I see some holes in your kind of front-line titles whether they are or not on the Wii which is, you know, more than half of the home console market today. It gets categorized as being a family friendly market and you're well represented there, but it is over half the market. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on developing for the Wii?", "Strauss Zelnick", "On your question about downloadable content, right now the structure of the business is we put out a packaged good and we're following it up with downloadable content. And I think your question is: Is that the nature of the business going forward or might front-line product be distributed that way as well? And I think the answer is one step at a time. There are bandwidth issues; there are technical limitations. There are also business model limitations.", "That said, I'm sure over time some frontline product will be distributed entirely electronically, but from the point of view of a producer and distributor, which is our point of view, in a way it's irrelevant. Our goal is to make the best quality interactive entertainment that we can. We'll continue to do that with hardware companies. I don't see that changing. We're thrilled that we support Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo - we love all our children equally - and we have terrific relationships across the board.", "So I don't see the console business changing. I don't see us entering an open format world anytime soon. The video game business has been around a long time and there's a reason for the specific technology that the business is tied to.", "I do think that the notion of electronic distribution is important. It's good for the business. It's good for everyone engaged in the business, and I do think we'll continue to pursue it. That said, from our own point of view, how products are distributed is somewhat less relevant than the quality of the products themselves. That's our big focus.", "Benjamin Feder", "Strauss, I got quoted a little bit in the [press's quarter] about the issues about [inaudible] games and downloadable content and all that stuff and, you know, I should say that while the issue is real for the industry and is shared with our peers, we value our retail partners, we think they're terrific partners for us, and there's a balance between both in the economics and in the content about what gets sold at retail and what gets available on download. And I see that balance, you know, it could - there'll be ebbs and flows, but it'll be a balance as opposed to one or the other for at least a long period of time. ", "And I can't call where it's going to go ultimately, but I see it as a balance more than anything and I agree with Strauss that our console partners will continue to be our console partners for a long time to come.", "With respect to the release schedule, you may characterize as holes. I don't quite see it the same way. 2K Sports for a long time has been developing on the Wii and we continue to develop for the Wii. We have Don King Boxing coming out for the Wii. Cat Daddy has two unannounced [huddles] on the Wii. I think those will be terrifically helpful.", "I think it's important when we talk about Chinatown Wars also to remember that this is really the first game on the Nintendo platform that Rockstar's developing it for. There aren't a lot of Mrated titles on Nintendo platforms, certainly not the DS, and this is going to be - we're going to watch this very carefully to see the opportunity. I do believe that there is an opportunity for Mrated titles on Nintendo DS and on the Wii, and I believe that we are the right company to be delivering that content, so I watch that carefully.", "So I don't think there's a hole. I think across the board we've got an interest and we have an ability to deliver on the Wii. As I've said before, we value our relationship with Nintendo very, very greatly and we intend to continue that relationship.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "", "First of all, going back to JT's line of questioning, can you give us an idea as to this 13\u00a0million GTA 4 units, how many of those are Xbox 360 platform? So what's the addressable market for the downloadable The Lost and Damned.", "Lainie Goldstein", "It's approximately 50/50, Ed.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "And what about a geographic breakdown, U.S. versus international?", "Lainie Goldstein", "It's about 50/50 there as well.", "Benjamin Feder", "50/50 generally.", "Lainie Goldstein", "50/50 over both, right.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "So 50/50 platform, 50/50 geographic. And what about the economics of Midnight Club downloadable content versus GTA downloadable content, is there any material difference there? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, the GTA downloadable content was subject to our Microsoft agreement that we haven't discussed specifics on, but the Midnight Club downloadable content is a separate arrangement. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Separately, can you give us an idea - you mentioned some comments, Lainie, during your prepared remarks about movements to the release schedule. Can you give us any color as to what was moving around?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, there's some titles that were not previously announced, so we're not going to talk about those in detail. And then there's other products that may have been earlier in the year that may have moved towards later in the year. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "So it's some unannounced products moving out of the fiscal year?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "And then other products just moving later in the fiscal year, again unannounced?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Correct. Yes.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "And then can you give us an idea as to what your headcount was like in the studios within Rockstar and 2K as of now or as of the quarter end?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, the total development studio personnel is 1,500 approximately at the end of the year, but we don't break that down by label.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "And what is your expectation for that headcount by the end of the current fiscal year?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We also don't provide that level of detail, but we are focused on growing our development capabilities throughout all of our studies.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "And then just a last quick question for you is can you give us an idea where on the revenue side there was an upside relative to your own expectations for the January quarter, however specific you can be?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, NBA did fantastically well during the quarter. We also had some - GTA 4 and Midnight Club did better than we had expected. And also Carnival Games is a game that just continues and continues to surprise us and do fantastically in the market. And also I mentioned in my prepared remarks the catalog just was extremely strong during the quarter.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "And then the last question I have is: Is there any particular takeaways - I'm not sure, Ben, this maybe addressed more to you - but any particular takeaways coming out of Destination PlayStation that you heard, not necessarily from Sony but just from the retail channel in general, that you think are relevant at this time as we kind of look at how the industry's performing.", "Benjamin Feder", "Well, if I can brag for a second I will tell you that the universal feedback that we got is that we were one of the most [inaudible], had one of the most exciting presentations of any of the publishers out there, so we'll see. We hate to do that on a call, but I can't help myself. So I'm very pleased at the reception we got at Destination PlayStation.", "And in terms of industry response, I think we said in the prepared remarks this is an environment where we see consumers exhibiting either a flight to quality and/or a flight to value, and we see that as well. And the value can get confused with casual and family orientation, but I do think that at the right price those titles sell as well. That was validated at Destination PlayStation.", "And as I said, I think Take-Two is perfectly positioned in that regard. We've got great frontline product and Jack Of All Games to deliver values to an array of channels that don't necessarily show up at Destination PlayStation, but are certainly there in numbers as well. So that was reconfirmed. It confirms what we had suspected, in any event, kind of flight to quality and flight to value.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets.", "Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets", "", "I'd appreciate it if you could give us kind of an update on the baseball business and maybe just the Sports business in general, if you're seeing any more with the initial few weeks of the baseball game being out there now, if you can kind of give us an idea of how that's performing relative to expectations and whether or not the economy may be having a bigger impact on your Sports business or less impact on your Sports business relative to the overall market?", "Benjamin Feder", "The Sports business generally, I'd say, it's hard to tell. NBA 2K9 has done terrifically well. It's a word we use eternally. It's on fire. It's just been a fantastic success for us. We're really, really pleased with it. We're pleased with the guys at VC and the guys at 2K Sports. They've done a terrific job with it.", "And it's too early to tell. I know some of you have seen kind of reviews. I think it's too early to tell A) on those reviews, and B) the way those reviews are skewed, one or two reviews kind of skew it down. If you kind of lop off the bottom and, in fairness, lop off the top, it actually looks a lot better than you would see just on the headline number from Metacritic. So we're watching the market carefully.", "It's also important to remember that this year we have more SKUs coming out in baseball than [inaudible] with The Bigs coming out. So there's a lot going on in the baseball season in general, so I think it's way too early to call, but we're watching it very, very carefully. I think the guys at VC have done a very good job given the time constraints that they were under, so we have full faith in the team at VC to create the best baseball game available. ", "Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets", "And just, I guess, kind of a housekeeping thing. How many more years are left on your current major league baseball relationship?", "Benjamin Feder", "About three years - 2012.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference back over to Strauss Zelnick for closing comments.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, all, for joining us. We feel pleased about the results we're reporting today. We are taking, as we've said, a prudent outlook for the rest of the year and we're cautiously optimistic about how that's unfolding based on the current results. And of course it's always nice to get on the phone on a day when the market's up as much as it is, so thanks for joining us.", "Operator", "Thank you.

(NASDAQ:TTWO)   F2Q07 Earnings Call  June 11, 2007  4:30 PM ET", "Executives", "Cindy Buckwalter - Investor Relations ", " Strauss Zelnick - Chairman of the Board ", " Benjamin Feder - Chief Executive Officer ", " Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer ", "Analysts", "Heath Terry - Credit Suisse First Boston ", " Tony Gikas - Piper Jaffray ", " John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation ", " Michael Savner - Banc of America ", " Evan Wilson - Pacific Crest Securities ", " Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee ", " Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets ", "Operator", "Greetings, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Take-Two Interactive conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Cindy Buckwalter for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you, Ms. Buckwalter. You may begin. ", "Cindy Buckwalter", "Thank you. Welcome and thank you all for joining us for today\u2019s call. My name is Cindy Buckwalter, Executive Vice President for Take-Two Interactive. Today\u2019s one-hour call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Chairman of Take-Two; Ben Feder, our CEO; and Lainie Goldstein, our CFO. We are also joined by Seth Krauss, Take-Two's Chief Legal Counsel. The entire team will be available to answer questions you may have during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. ", "Before we begin, I would first like to quickly review our Safe Harbor statement by reminding everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us at this time. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, which may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com, or by contacting the SEC. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Cindy and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. On our last conference call with you, which was back in April, we spoke about our determination to revitalize Take-Two. We also said that the new management team would take actions within our first 100 days to address the major challenges facing the company. ", "Now, we\u2019ll still about a month shy of that official 100-day mark and our process is still ongoing. We\u2019ve made progress on many fronts, which we\u2019ll discuss in a few minutes. We\u2019re also planning another conference call, which is now scheduled for July 9th, to provide further detail on our action plans. ", "Also in today\u2019s call we\u2019ll be reviewing the financial results of our second quarter, which were right in line with the expectations we provided in our April conference call. We\u2019ll also discuss our financial outlook for the remainder of the year, which remains unchanged. ", "I would like to remind all of you of something we said on the last conference call. The focus of our efforts at Take-Two, our strategy here is to be the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient company in our industry. I am very pleased to say that two months into our process, we\u2019re more confident than ever that the company can achieve these objectives and that we\u2019re all on the same page trying to achieve the same thing. Our goal is to make great games and to delight consumers and in so doing, we expect to delight our employees and our shareholders. ", "As you know, our efforts during the initial period have been focused in five critical areas. First, ensuring that we have the right organizational structure to meet our goals; second, assessing all of our business units in developing strategic alternatives for any businesses that we determine to be non-core or unprofitable or marginal; third, taking steps to maximize the value of critical relationships, such as hardware suppliers and product licensors; fourth, reinforcing a disciplined product investment strategy; and fifth, working aggressively to resolve litigation and regulatory issues effectively and appropriately. ", "Ben\u2019s going to talk about our progress in each of these five areas shortly. What I\u2019d like to emphasize is how pleased we are with what we found at Take-Two so far. The senior management team is very professional, very confident, and very focused and committed to the success of the company. Our development teams are also highly focused on making great games -- it\u2019s our watchword around here. There are many exciting products in the pipeline. All of the titles planned for fiscal 2007 are on track and look great, and throughout the company our people seem to be responding positively to the atmosphere of openness and communication and we hope that that\u2019s becoming a distinguishing feature of this new Take-Two. ", "In short, the revitalization program is off to a very strong start. We really couldn\u2019t have asked for any more. We\u2019re confident that Take-Two is on track to become more responsive, more disciplined, more cost-efficient and that that will lead to reinforce and enhance our creative spirit that makes great games. We think efficiency leads to creativity and that they are firmly entwined. ", "With that said, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ben. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Thanks, Strauss. We\u2019ve made solid progress in many of the critical areas that we targeted for improvement and we expect to accomplish even more in the remaining period of our 100-day plan. I\u2019d like to personally thank the Take-Two team, which has devoted significant time and energy to this process. ", "Let me take you through five critical areas of focus. In terms of our first priority area, organizational structure, today we are announcing several significant restructuring initiatives. Overall, we expect these initiatives to reduce fixed overhead on an annualized run-rate basis by approximately $25 million by the end of fiscal 2008. Approximately 60% of this amount represents a reduction of operating expenses and the remaining 40% is a reduction of cost of goods sold. ", "I should emphasize that this figure represents only those cost reductions that we have identified to date as part of our restructuring plan. We are committed to continually pursuing opportunities to improve the efficiencies of our company. ", "As for the specific actions we are taking, first, we\u2019ve significantly restructured our international operations to consolidate and align marketing and sales operations according to the business functions as opposed to geography. This has allowed us to eliminate an entire layer of management and to create a more efficient, responsive, and transparent international organization. ", "Second, we are consolidating on the west coast the management, marketing and business development operations of 2K and 2K Sports labels. This is expected to result in better communication with the 2K organization, move us closer to our sports development teams and other key resources, reduce our lease expense, and enhance overall efficiency. With our 2K operations centralized on the west coast, we can better focus on the growth opportunities in this business. ", "Third, all administrative functions for labels and studios, such as HR, legal affairs, finance and IT, will now report to Take-Two Corporate rather than their individual business units. This will improve control and accountability. ", "Fourth and finally, we\u2019ve consolidated our third-party PC distribution business into our North American sales organization. ", "Excluding any asset impairments, we expect to recognize restructuring costs of approximately $50 million related to these actions. About half of these costs will be recognized during the balance of fiscal 2007 and the remainder in fiscal 2008. ", "While we are very pleased to have accomplished the significant realignment in such a short period of time, we will continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance the organizational effectiveness and productivity of our business. In addition to the organizational restructuring, we also pledge to assess all business units and develop strategic alternatives for any operations that are non-core, unprofitable, or marginal. ", "Now obviously, publishing is Take-Two's core business and that will be the primary focus of our resources and energies. Within publishing, we consider the Rockstar, 2K, 2K Sports, and Global Star labels to be core holdings. ", "We are in active discussions regarding possible alternatives for Jack of All Games and Joytech. However, I want to emphasize that we are supporting these businesses and we will continue to support these businesses and operate them if we cannot reach terms that make economic sense. ", "Our third priority is to maximize the value of critical external relationships, specifically with licensors. We are continuing to work on this important aspect of our business and we will provide an update on our July 9th call. ", "Reinforcing a disciplined product investment strategy is our fourth focus area. We have extensively reviewed the products in our pipeline. While we are comfortable with the economic assumptions underlying most of the titles, we did write off several products in development that were planned for release beyond fiscal 2007. More importantly, we are instituting a greenlight process designed to support and enhance our reputation for creativity and ensure the economic viability of every product. We\u2019ll have more to say about the greenlight process on the July 9th call as well. ", "Finally, we\u2019re committed to working aggressively to resolve our outstanding litigation and regulatory issues. We\u2019ve been in regular contact with the Manhattan district attorney and the SEC to ensure them of our continued cooperation. While we can\u2019t speculate as to the course of their investigations, we will continue to work with the DA and the SEC towards a resolution of any outstanding issue. ", "I would like to touch on two additional topics; our financial results for the quarter and our product pipeline. With respect to our financial performance, net revenue for the second quarter was $205 million, or about 23% below the same period last year and slightly better than we forecast on our last call. Our loss per share was $0.71, the same as last year, which was right in line with our expectations. ", "Non-GAAP net loss per share, excluding unusual charges on stock-based compensation in both the 2007 and 2006 periods, was $0.41 in the second quarter of this year versus $0.52 in the same quarter a year ago. Lainie will provide additional detail on our financial results in a moment. ", "We are reiterating our guidance that we provided on our last call. For the full year, we expect $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion in net revenue with break-even results on a GAAP basis. Note that both our revenue and earnings guidance exclude any potential impact from our restructuring. We\u2019ve also provided initial guidance for our third and fourth quarters as detailed in our press release, and upon which Lainie will elaborate in a moment. ", "We are pleased to report our product pipeline for fiscal 2007 remains on schedule. We remain confident in the release dates of our key second-half titles, Grand Theft Auto 4 for X-Box 360 and PlayStation 3, and BioShock for X-Box 360 and PC. We look forward to the release of two new sports titles this summer, the BIGS and All Pro Football 2K8. ", "To summarize, we have made great progress in a short period of time to deliver on the strategic actions to which we committed previously. ", "I would like to echo the point Strauss made about our confidence in the future and our high regard for the people at Take-Two. Together, we are making great strides in revitalizing the company and building on a great creative organization. ", "Now, it gives me great pleasure to turn the call over to Lainie Goldstein. As you know, we announced today that Lainie has been named our CFO. The decision to promote Lainie reflects her talent and professionalism and our confidence in her, as well as her contribution since taking on leadership of the finance team on an interim basis during the challenging period for the organization. So with that, Lainie. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Ben and good afternoon, everyone. I will be covering several topics today: first, a review of second quarter results and second, our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2007. Before we begin, I would like to note our new financial statement presentation in the financial tables of our press release. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we have also provided detail on various non-recurring and/or non-cash charges, such as professional fees related to our stock options investigation and various unusual regulatory matters, expenses relating to our management and board changes in Q2, stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects. We have provided this information in order to better reflect the performance of our business on an operating basis. We have also provided a reconciliation for our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results. ", "Now, to our Q2 results; net revenue was $205 million, compared with $265 million a year ago. Our GAAP net loss, which includes a total of $21.6 million in unusual charges and stock-based compensation expenses, was $51 million, or $0.71 per share. This compares to the net loss of $50 million, or $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2006. Our 2007 Q2 net loss included an $18.9 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and caused us to realize no tax benefits for the carry-forward tax effect of this loss. ", "Looking at our results on a pretax basis, our loss from operations was approximately $51 million compared to $77 million last year. Our decline in revenue year over year was primarily due to the strong sales last year of the Elder Scroll 4 Oblivion, which was launched in the 2006 second quarter and represented about $81 million of revenue in that period. ", "Offsetting the decrease from the Elder Scrolls, our leading titles this quarter were Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Story and Major League Baseball 2K7, each of which sold over 1 million units in the quarter. Our sports business was once again a strong contributor to revenue. Sports titles represented over 35% of our publishing revenue in the second quarter. ", "Looking at the breakdown of our total business, publishing revenue was 75% of the quarter\u2019s revenue, with distribution revenue at 25%, about the same as Q2 last year. Our distribution business decreased by about 21% from last year\u2019s second quarter, due primarily to the decline in volume and average selling prices of legacy platform titles. ", "In looking at our consolidated results, our total gross profit margin for this quarter increased significantly this year to 22% compared to less than 7% last year. This increase was due to above average royalty costs for the Elder Scrolls and approximately $18 million of impairment charges in Q2 last year, primarily related to our studio closures, compared to a $5.2 million impairment charge this year. ", "Additionally, this quarter we enjoyed a significant increase in the gross profit margin of our sports product, primarily Major League Baseball 2K7, NBA 2K7, and College Hoops 2K7, all of which had higher sales than their prior versions and comparable software development costs. ", "Also, per unit royalties were lower for our Major League Baseball 2K7 title this year. Since we have one additional MLB title planned for release this summer, the BIGS, our minimum annual royalty for MLB is amortized over a greater number of units, which reduced the per unit royalty costs. ", "Our operating expenses in the second quarter were approximately $97 million, up about $2 million from last year\u2019s second quarter. This was primarily driven by $9 million of charges related to the management and board changes this quarter. Additionally, G&A expenses rose this year, largely due to higher professional fees associated with the option investigation and responses to the SEC and the Manhattan DA. ", "Our R&D expenses declined as a result of our development studio closures in Q2 2006 and higher costs last year related to severance expenses. Our selling and marketing expenses also declined year over year, due primarily to a significant marketing campaign last year in connection with the launch of the Elder Scrolls. Lastly, we realized impairment charges of about $6 million in Q2 last year from write-offs of intangibles and trademarks. ", "The last area of discussion on our income statement relates to taxes. You will see that our effective income tax rate for our second quarter is negative 3%, a significant reduction from our 35% effective tax rate in Q2 2006. As a reminder, as we discussed on our year-end call, in light of our domestic cumulative losses for the past three years, we are required under FASB-109 to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Basically, what this means is that in fiscal 2007, despite our book loss, we are not recognizing the tax benefit of this loss, which would have reduced our net loss. Instead, we effectively incurred a non-cash income tax expense of $18.9 million, or $0.26 per share, due to our inability to record a benefit for the 2007 U.S. losses. It\u2019s important to note that as we generate taxable income in the U.S. in future periods, we will realize the benefit of the reversal of the valuation allowance. ", "Moving on to our balance sheet, at the end of Q2 we had approximately $108.5 million in cash. Net accounts receivable at the end of the second quarter were approximately $70 million compared to $143 million at the end of Q4 and $130 million at this time last year. Our DSO in Q2 were approximately 31 days, compared to 48 days in the fourth quarter and 44 days in the second quarter last year. Our accounts receivable reserve sat at $53 million at the end of the quarter, representing approximately 43% of gross receivables. Our Q2 reserves were approximately 11% of trailing six months revenue and about 7% of trailing nine months revenue, lower than last year\u2019s Q2 levels as many of our publishing titles were introduced at lower average selling prices this year due to the industry\u2019s console transition. ", "Inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately $80 million, down significantly from $96 million at year-end and $92 million at Q2 last year, due to our reduced sales volume and continued focused on managing Jack\u2019s inventory level. ", "Our software development costs and licenses totaled about $156 million at the end of the quarter, compared to approximately $117 million at year-end and about $106 million at this time last year. The increase was primarily related to the key titles planned for release over the next 12 months, including Grand Theft Auto 4, BioShock, and All Pro Football 2K8. We currently have over 35 titles in various stages of development on current and next-gen platforms. ", "Now a few comments about our guidance, as detailed in our press release. For fiscal 2007, we have reiterated our full-year guidance of break-even on a GAAP basis, including stock-based compensation expense of $0.22 per share but excluding any reorganization and restructuring charges, and $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion in revenue. Included in the reorganization expenses is additional stock-based compensation of $0.03 per share. Additionally, fiscal 2007 estimates only reflect tax expense for the company\u2019s international operations. ", "For Q3, we expect net revenue in the range of $195 million to $215 million, with a GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.65, including stock-based compensation expense of $0.06 per share but excluding any reorganization and restructuring charges. Additionally, third quarter estimates reflect no tax benefit, as discussed earlier. ", "For Q4, we expect net revenue in the range of $520 million to $550 million, with GAAP net income per share in the range of $1.35 to $1.40, including stock-based compensation of $0.06 per share but excluding any reorganization and restructuring charges. Included in the Q4 reorganization expenses is additional stock-based compensation of $0.03 per share. Fourth quarter estimates reflect only tax expense for our international operations as well. ", "Let me provide some additional data points on our 2007 outlook. We expect our total revenue mix to be split about 75% publishing and 25% distribution. This is fairly comparable to what we experienced in 2006. However, the projected mix of business in publishing will be more favorable from a margin standpoint. ", "On a blended basis for publishing and distribution, we expect gross margins for fiscal 2007 to be in line with the levels we achieved in Q4 of 2006. A significant portion of Rockstar\u2019s revenue will come from our premium priced Grand Theft Auto 4 on next-gen platforms compared to 2006, when a large part of Rockstar\u2019s business was lower priced catalog products on current-gen platforms. ", "For 2K Games, we expect a greater percentage of sales to come from higher margin, internally developed and owned titles led by BioShock. ", "Now let me give you an idea of where we see our operating expenses trending. We are obviously coming off a recent period of high G&A expense based on some of the regulatory challenges we\u2019ve had along with our business reorganization. We see Q3 levels improving slightly compared to Q2 based on reduced professional fees. ", "Selling and marketing is closely tied to our product releases, so you can expect a larger marketing spend overall in 2007, about in line with the prior year\u2019s selling and marketing as a percentage of sales. ", "R&D will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on what products our teams are working on but on an annual basis, we would expect R&D to be about comparable to 2006. ", "Depreciation and amortization should grow at about the same rate as last year. ", "As for taxes, you can expect any additional current year U.S. losses to be recorded without tax benefit while future profits will benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. As a result, our losses in the short-term are magnified as income earned in all jurisdictions outside the U.S. should result in tax expense. ", "Taking these factors together, we believe we can show a meaningful improvement in our operating performance in the balance of 2007. Looking into 2008, with the additional opportunities to capitalize on the strength of our core franchises and our sports business, and while the benefits of our restructuring will begin to be realized in fiscal 2007, the impact of these operational changes will be reflected more significantly in our fiscal 2008 results. ", "At this point, I will turn the call back to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Lainie. I would like to conclude the formal portion of the call by reminding everyone that we do wish to maintain open lines of communication in the weeks and months ahead. We\u2019ll be communicating with you again very soon, in early July. We will provide additional elements for our 100-day plan. We\u2019ll also be in touch with you at E3. ", "We hope that your takeaway from the call is that we\u2019re moving ahead very aggressively. We\u2019ve already made a lot of progress on the initiatives that we outlined and we think those initiatives will lead to enhanced profitability and enhanced shareholder value. ", "We\u2019d now be happy to take your questions. Operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ", "Heath Terry - Credit Suisse First Boston", "Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us an idea, or talk about what kind of progress you\u2019re making on the licensing front, particularly getting any kind of relief from your partners on the sports side and to the extent that that\u2019s actually an important goal for you. Also, if you could give us an update on, at least now that you\u2019ve been in the role for a while, how your philosophy around licensing products, like the upcoming Fantastic Four movie and some of the other licenses the company\u2019s done in the past has changed. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "In terms of the sports business, we\u2019ve expressed the commitments of that business going forward. We\u2019re trying to optimize the business and there are a couple of ways you optimize the business. The first and most important thing is make the best titles in the business and the company already achieved that goal and frankly, not on our watch. Our games rate about 20 points on average more highly than our big competitor in this space and we think consumers are going to come to the conclusion that these are the games to have. And we like the business. It\u2019s an annual business. We also have exclusivity in a key business, which is the baseball business. ", "So we think we\u2019re set up in many ways to build a good profitable business there, and some of the progress we are going to make is simply going to be volume related. As we sell more units, as these new platforms grow and as people begin to realize their expectations for a great sports games are more closely in line with the games that we produce. ", "There are potentially opportunities to enhance the nature of the relationships we have with licensors. We don\u2019t have anything to announce right now. Obviously it\u2019s something that we\u2019re focused on but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the be all and end all of the business. I do think if we can achieve a win-win situation with licensors where we sell more games and they are great games and they do well and we do well, everyone should be happy and that\u2019s part of our goal. ", "On the licenses side, I feel really good about Fantastic Four. I\u2019m not sure what else I could tell you about it. Our core business around here is creating our own intellectual property. There are also certain instances where licenses can be very valuable to us. Generally speaking, the experience that I\u2019ve had and we\u2019ve had in the videogame business is a good license in a bad game doesn\u2019t yield a good result. A great game without a license yields a great result. A great game and a great license can indeed yield a great result so you can take away from that sort of how I feel about the business. At the end of the day, what\u2019s the common element of success? A great game. ", "Heath Terry - Credit Suisse First Boston", "Sure. And then, as you look at the business longer term, is there anything about what you found about Take-Two that would suggest that over time your margins are going to be in line with those of the other companies your size in the industry, besides obviously the component of your business that\u2019s distribution? ", "Strauss Zelnick", "If you pull out the distribution business, then the question would simply be is there any reason for our costs of operating and our gross margins to be different? The only thing that would change it is if we made choices that meant we operated either more or less expensively than our competitors. ", "There\u2019s one material difference, which is that we do have a stated strategy which is not everyone\u2019s strategy, to make the very best games in the business for next-gen consoles and that\u2019s an expensive proposition. We try to be efficient in the way that we do it. We\u2019re very focused on efficiency. We think efficiency and creativity go hand-in-hand, that they\u2019re not at all in conflict. But everyone knows that producing games for next-gen consoles is complex and expensive, not everyone can do it. That is what we do and we think if you are going to make the very, very best games you have to put your resources there and if that includes hiring and attracting the very best personnel, then that could change your percentage margin but hopefully you\u2019d be doing it, if you\u2019re rational, to increase profitability. ", "One of the things I\u2019ve encouraged analysts to think about as they look at our company is while margins are interesting, at the end of the day, what do you really want to know about? You want to know about your return on invested capital and how much cash flow we\u2019re generating in a given year and are we going to make more money around here than this company used to make. ", "Sitting here at the cusp of enormous growth, without regard to Take-Two, in the next-gen consolers, this is going to occur. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ll benefit from it. I believe we will but I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. I can only tell you we\u2019re doing the best we can but all of us have enough of a crystal ball to know that the next several years is going to be a period of wonderful growth driven by next-gen consoles and there are only a small handful of us who are competing aggressively in this space. ", "It may on a pound for pound basis therefore cost us more to compete to make a great game and market it but if we made the right decision and the market grows, and I believe we did and I believe it will, then we are going to make more cash flow and that\u2019s what I think everyone ought to be focused on. Obviously at the end of the day we\u2019ll be judged on what happens to our stock price and our stock price will reflect all of those things. ", "So I\u2019m a little bit less focused on operating margins, although it is certainly not irrelevant, than I am focused on our return on invested capital, the value of what we are creating in terms of cash flow on an ongoing basis and what happens to our stock price. ", "Heath Terry - Credit Suisse First Boston", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Gikas with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. ", "Tony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions; do weak sales of the PlayStation 3 hardware system at a high price point impact the launch of GTA 4 at all in your view? The second part of that question, will there be any premium versions that you can talk about yet and will the PS3 or X-Box 360 versions be differentiated in any way? And then I have a quick follow-up. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "In terms of the release date, no, we\u2019re confirming the release date and we\u2019re going to meet the release dates, so let me just say that clearly. ", "We think that frankly, the release of Grand Theft Auto 4 is going to have a materially beneficial impact on the sales of PS3. Certainly if history is any guide, that\u2019s going to be the case. We think this is a must-own title that will help the platform. ", "I think plenty\u2019s been written about the price point. I probably don\u2019t need to jump on that bandwagon but I think if you look at history, next-gen consoles sell in at certain price points. They are often introduced at high price points. Those prices tend to be reduced and when they are reduced, selling increases. ", "Obviously we\u2019ve episodic content coming for X-Box 360 for the title and because the consoles do differ, there will be some differences in the games. My kids actually have three game consoles at home and sometimes play the same titles on different consoles and they see some differences and they find that compelling. So there\u2019ll be -- these obviously are not going to be identical experiences but they are going to be very, very close. ", "Benjamin Feder", "In terms of the premium version, we\u2019ve announced a special edition for GTA 4 that will be premium priced and very nicely packaged actually. I\u2019ve seen a mock-up of the package. It\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful product. That\u2019s been previously announced, Tony. ", "Tony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Yes. Will the premium version be perhaps the only version available in the first weeks of the launch or will both versions be available? ", "Benjamin Feder", "It\u2019ll be day and date. ", "Tony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Day and date. And then, could you just help us, a housekeeping question with the tax rate for next year -- will you be paying taxes? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "We won\u2019t be paying taxes in the U.S. but we will continue to pay taxes in our international operation. ", "Tony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, and how about your view of software growth in the market this year for the overall industry, looking at calendar \u201907 and perhaps calendar \u201908, if you have an opinion? ", "Benjamin Feder", "We focus on Take-Two primarily and would not want to opine on the industry, although as Strauss said, we think that we foresee growth for the next couple of years based on next-gen consoles. We\u2019re pretty sanguine about the prospects for growth industry wide. I wouldn\u2019t comment on specific growth rates. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Tony, I probably read the same research you do. I think most people feel like the titles per platform are going to go up with the next-gen console. There were an average of roughly 10 the last time around. A lot of analysts feel the number is going to be more like 12 or 13. ", "I think as consoles get better and you can do more with them as the population of gamers gets broader and as we go from early adopters into general population, you may well see that happen. I certainly hope so. I will tell you our plans are not driven by that. ", "Tony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Taylor with Arcadia Investment Corporation. Please proceed with your question. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "I have a couple of questions on a bunch of things here. It looks like you are going to change your presentation in your statement style. Since you are no longer breaking out software development costs and IP, I wonder if that\u2019s going to be in the 10-Q because I think that\u2019s a valuable thing for us to look at separately. Are you going to give us a little more detail in the Q on that? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "No, we are going to be -- we are grouping them together going forward. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Any reason for that? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Just discussions with our auditors and it\u2019s just the presentation that\u2019s more commonly used. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "But it\u2019s not commonly used because everybody else is breaking it out separately. I\u2019d ask you to reconsider that because I think these are two totally different line items and it would make it easier for us on the outside to look at that, so let me just throw that in there. ", "Benjamin Feder", "But John, just to be clear, it\u2019s being driven by our auditors. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "This is less transparency though, let\u2019s be clear. ", "Benjamin Feder", "I hear you. I\u2019m just expressing to you it\u2019s being driven by our auditors. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay and then in the second quarter, could you give us what the catalog was as a percent of total please? ", "Benjamin Feder", "It\u2019s about a third. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "And then in the fourth quarter, could you give us a sense of what you think the revenue mix is going to look like between the U.S. and international, given the tax situation? It seems like that might be an important factor. ", "Benjamin Feder", "I\u2019m not sure -- Lainie\u2019s going to give you the full year. I\u2019m not sure we can actually break it out for the quarter right now. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Because a lot\u2019s going to depend on how you allocate, I\u2019m going to guess, how you allocate shipments of GTA between the U.S. and domestic. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "For the full year, North America is 73% and international is 27% for the full year -- ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "What\u2019s that? ", "Benjamin Feder", "We\u2019ll give you more detail as we have it. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay, great. Last question; could you break down the inventory number between published and distribution for us? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Sure. Inventory or distribution is 62% and publishing was 38%. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Savner with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed with your question. ", "Michael Savner - Banc of America", "Thanks very much. A couple of questions, and I would just echo JT's comment as well about comparability and transparency for expenses to get some more clarity, so if that\u2019s something that can be considered, I agree that would be very helpful. ", "But specifically as we look at the GTA release in the fall, is it too late -- is there any possibility that given the strength of PS2 hardware at some point in the future we could see a PS2 version? I think everyone agrees that it\u2019s certainly going to be a hardware driver for next gen, but clearly we\u2019re going to be starting from a lower point than I think people thought a year ago. So maybe just talk about any flexibility you\u2019d have going forward about porting that to an older legacy console. I\u2019ll ask that and then I have a follow-up, please. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Michael, it seems unlikely. Once you\u2019ll see the game, you\u2019ll understand why. We\u2019re taking advantage of the features of these new consoles. It\u2019s not a -- this is a brand new game. This is something that -- ", "Benjamin Feder", "I\u2019d say more than that. The guys at Rockstar are pushing the envelope on the hardware. The hardware itself is pretty impressive and we think that GTA 4 will be the cutting edge game for PS3 and for X-Box 360 and that\u2019s going to drive the gaming experience. ", "Michael Savner - Banc of America", "Fair enough. I assumed that was the answer but I wanted to at least see if a skinny-down version was an optioned. Second one, maybe you could give us a little bit more clarity on your strategy development for the Wii. The previous management team at the onset didn\u2019t really have a lot of effort behind it. Obviously all the other publishers have ramped up their allocation of resources for it. As you look at the opportunity on the Wii, do you see any of your existing franchises being core to the Wii platform or is that something you think you are going to have to develop new franchises or licenses for? ", "Strauss Zelnick", "To be perfectly frank, I don\u2019t think it takes a rocket scientist to realize what\u2019s going on with Wii and DS. I will tell you that very quickly we turned to both 2K and to Rockstar and said guys, we need a DS strategy and a Wii strategy and we are working on it. As we get into the next quarter and into budget season for 2008, everybody in this company is completely focused on it. ", "Having said that, development cycles are long. Sports aren\u2019t as good as games develop for specific platforms but we are looking at all of them across the board for Wii and DS. I will tell you that carnival games that we\u2019ve announced for the Wii have gotten a lot of attention in the marketplace, as well as with our first-party partners. So we are pretty excited about that. ", "We have some -- some have been announced, some Wii titles have been announced and we are working to put more out on the Wii and DS. ", "Michael Savner - Banc of America", "Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Wilson with Pacific Crest. Please proceed with your question. ", "Evan Wilson - Pacific Crest Securities ", "Thanks for taking the questions. First on the restructuring, could you quantify for us how many heads you expect to reduce across the lines? The way it reads in the press release, from the description it sounds like most are coming from sales and marketing functions. Do you plan on a component coming from the development organization as well? If you could give us the headcount for total Take-Two and for development now, I\u2019d appreciate it. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "We\u2019re not going to actually disclose the actual number. This is the most sensitive task that we have ahead of us and people\u2019s lives and livelihoods are engaged here. I think as I said in the first call, this is the thing that we do with the most trepidation and the most difficulty. ", "It is a significant percentage of our workforce and we will be able to tell you when we\u2019re done through this where headcount is. But we\u2019d rather not put a fine point on it, especially as it\u2019s in process right now. We\u2019re trying to be sensitive to people\u2019s needs and goals. ", "Also, to your point, yes, there\u2019s sales and marketing, so there\u2019s that. There\u2019s also admin, because we\u2019ve centralized overhead in admin, so it\u2019s really both. We told people that we are going to have a strong look at this and try to do this early and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve tried to do. But to be clear, we\u2019re taking aggressive steps by any standard. ", "Evan Wilson - Pacific Crest Securities ", "Could you give us the headcount for total Take-Two right now? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "2,100 employees. ", "Evan Wilson - Pacific Crest Securities ", "Thank you. And as it relates to the deferred revenue chunk associated with the episodic content on X-Box 360, you can see that $25 million of that moved into short-term deferred. Could you give us any sense of when that\u2019s going to hit the P&L? Will we see $25 million at one time and then the second 25 or will it be a slow bleed? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "The first 25 is for the first episodic content package that\u2019s supposed to go out and that is in March of \u201908. That\u2019s why it moved into current because it\u2019s in the next 12 months. The second 25 will be for the second episodic, the episode, and that will be later in fiscal \u201908. ", "Evan Wilson - Pacific Crest Securities ", "All right and final question, for the January quarter, thanks for providing the detail on fiscal \u201908 titles. Could you tell us which one of those fiscal \u201808s will be there, or at least out for the holiday season? That\u2019s it. Thanks. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "I didn\u2019t understand the question. Which one of the fiscal \u201808s? I didn\u2019t follow. ", "Evan Wilson - Pacific Crest Securities ", "Exactly. We have detail specifically by quarter what you guys are going to release through October. Are there any other of those titles that you\u2019ve listed for fiscal \u201908 that will come before Christmas? Thanks. ", "Benjamin Feder", "You mean are they going to be ahead of schedule? ", "Evan Wilson - Pacific Crest Securities ", "No, fiscal \u201908 includes November, December and January. I was wondering what other titles will come up before Christmas. ", "Benjamin Feder", "We\u2019ve announced what we\u2019re comfortable announcing and I wouldn\u2019t hazard a guess on anymore titles that are coming out before Christmas at this point. ", "Evan Wilson - Pacific Crest Securities ", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question. ", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of quick ones; first one, if you can speak to the 2K Sports division -- give us some timeline at this point when you expect that division to be profitable. ", "And then on GTA 4, the unit shipment pattern here for this one, how should we think about how that will break down between this year and next year? If you can give us at least some broad color on should we expect -- should we look at history in terms of how many units you\u2019ll ship this year, or if you have any other way for us to think about it. ", "And then, what kind of cash position do you expect to be at at the end of the year? ", "Strauss Zelnick", "You\u2019ve got a bunch of questions in there. In terms of the first one in the sports business, we\u2019re no longer going to predict a specific time for profitability. We did previously say we didn\u2019t think the sports business would be on a standalone basis profitable in calendar \u201907. But what I also said is it\u2019s not a significant negative either. We feel very good about it but we haven\u2019t parsed the specific profitability of that line of business for \u201908 yet. As we put together our \u201908 budget plans, we\u2019ll have a point of view on it. Suffice it to say that to the extent that it\u2019s not making money, it\u2019s not a big drag by any means on the company as a whole. To the extent it is making money, it probably won\u2019t be a huge contributor next year either. ", "GTA, too early to say what \u201908 will look like for Grand Theft Auto sales but we feel very, very good about it, as you\u2019d imagine we would and no, I don\u2019t think you can follow a trendline on the split of \u201907 and \u201908 based on a release date because it\u2019s much more driven by the platform take-up than anything else and we can\u2019t parse the platform take-up. ", "I\u2019m sorry, your third question? ", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee", "Your expectation for your cash position. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "We don\u2019t project the cash flow forward but we\u2019ll continue to give you updates as we have them. Lainie is nodding at me, so -- ", "Lainie Goldstein", "With the reorganization and the restructuring charges that we\u2019re pulling together, we\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t have a -- we haven\u2019t put together a projection on that right now but we\u2019ll be working on that going forward. ", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Good afternoon. A couple of questions; first of all, with regard to the sports business, what sort of revenue growth could we see in that business overall in \u201907 versus \u201906 and how much of that is coming from more SKUs versus increased units sold per SKU? ", "And then, looking at the GTA game for a moment, what are you looking for or what should we be thinking of as far as the anticipated average selling price for GTA 4 as compared to what GTA San Andreas did, given the special edition SKU as well as the -- I assume the $6 price point you\u2019ll use on the GTA 4 for the regular SKU. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Lainie, why don\u2019t you take that? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Grand Theft Auto for the new platform, for the regular edition, is going to be priced at $59.99. I think we\u2019ve announced that previously. What was the other part -- ", "Benjamin Feder", "$89.99 on the special -- ", "Lainie Goldstein", "$89.99 for the special edition. ", "Benjamin Feder", "And in the sports business, we do see it growing materially year over year but we don\u2019t have the exact figures. We don\u2019t break out those figures. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Any idea how the sports business growth is -- how much of it is coming from the increased units per SKU versus from additional SKUs such as The BIGS and All Pro Football? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "It\u2019s actually a combination of the unit volume as well as pricing. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "As you\u2019d imagine, both are very, very important to us in terms of the license relationships. In terms of how we\u2019re actually doing in the market, we care about units per SKU. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay and looking at GTA again for a moment, what\u2019s the expectation at this point? Is it that a third of the units could be special edition or 20%? What\u2019s embedded in your guidance for the fourth quarter? ", "Benjamin Feder", "It\u2019s actually a fairly small number. We deliberately try to limit the number of special editions going out. They are meant as special packages for our most loyal fans and we expect the bulk of GTA 4 to be standard edition as opposed to special edition. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, and then two final housekeeping questions; what is your expected share base in the fourth quarter, in your profitable quarter? What is the current headcount at your studios? We got it for the overall but what is it for the development teams? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "In Q4, the share base is 74,341,000 shares -- approximately 74 million. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "And as far as headcount at the studios currently? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "About 1,750 heads. ", "Benjamin Feder", "That\u2019s publishing, publishing overall. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Right. About -- at the end of April, it was about 1,300 roughly in the studios. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you very much.

Thank you, Ms. Buckwalter, you may begin.", " Cindi Buckwalter ", "Welcome, and thank you for joining us for today's call. Today's one-hour call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, our Chairman; Ben Feder, our CEO; and Lainie Goldstein, our CFO. We are also joined by Seth Krauss, Take-Two's Chief Legal Counsel. The entire team will be available to answer questions you may have during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "Before we begin, I would first like to quickly review our Safe Harbor statement by reminding everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us at this time. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006 and our 10-Q for the third quarter ended July 31, which we are filing tonight; or, by contacting the SEC. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks Cindi and good afternoon. Thanks for joining us today. I'm very proud of the way Take-Two has performed as an organization in the third quarter, and particularly in the past month. The period hasn\u2019t been without challenges, to say the least. The team at Take-Two has responded to those challenges decisively, constructively and professionally and as a result, we have made solid progress on a number of fronts. ", "This afternoon I would like to comment on our efforts to manage and grow the company's extremely valuable portfolio of video game assets; then Ben will talk about various operational developments and Lainie will review our financial results and guidance. We intend to provide you with a good deal of detail about our past performance and our future plans today, and I hope the takeaway will be this: we have rapidly addressed a number of Take-Two's historic issues and we are now focused on future growth.", "We are deeply committed to building the company's major game franchises and to creating new ones. Our most important focus in the months and years ahead will be building and diversifying our revenue streams. Simply stated, we are moving from fixing the company to managing and growing our business. ", "Much has already been said about the delay in the release schedule for Grand Theft Auto IV, so I will just touch on the topic briefly today. I think it's important to emphasize that our actions demonstrated that the Take-Two team can and will make tough decisions that we think are in the best interests of our consumers, our core brand and product franchises, and our shareholders. Everyone here agreed on the need to devote the additional time necessary to make a game we can all be proud of. Once that game is delivered, we are confident that consumers will respond enthusiastically, with the fervor that only a Grand Theft Auto title can command. By the way, I just saw the latest build of the game on Friday, and it looks great.", "In the case of Manhunt 2, our Rockstar team responded quickly and effectively to the ratings issue. They produced a modified version and have received an M rating from the ESRB, while preserving the spirit and experience of this extraordinary game. As a result, Manhunt 2 will launch on Wii, PS2 and PSP in North America in October, in time for Halloween. We have high hopes for the performance of this title. ", "I'm particularly pleased with the tremendous market response to 2K's BioShock. The game has received unprecedented ratings. It is the highest rated Xbox 360 title in history and it is the highest rated game this year across all console platforms, according to MetaCritic. It's also generating lots of buzz among consumers. It is reportedly the top-selling title at Gamestop. In less than a month since launch, we have already shipped more than 1.5 million units; clearly, we have a new hit franchise on our hands. This one was developed internally and we own the IP. We are proving our ability to diversify Take-Two's product portfolio.", "We are also building on the growing opportunity in casual games. Today we announced the formation of 2K Play, a new publishing label aimed at providing fun and engrossing family-friendly games for players of all ages and skill levels. The cornerstone of 2K Play is our new videogame partnership with Nickelodeon, featuring several of their top-rated properties including Dora the Explorer and Go, Diego, Go! which will be among the first titles to debut under the 2K Play label this fall.", "Also in the casual game space I'm pleased to say that we already have a hit that demonstrates the breadth of our product range, Carnival Games, for the Wii. The success of this family-oriented, wholly-owned and internally developed title shows that our developers have actually been ahead of the curve engaging and satisfying the demand for casual games. I think it is worth noting that seven of the titles in our pipeline are being developed for the Wii as our teams are responding rapidly to the popularity of that system.", "We have a really strong pipeline for holiday 2007 and all of 2008. We are also pleased to provide our initial fiscal 2008 financial guidance today. Although it is early, I think it is worth mentioning that 2009 also is shaping up to be strong. Fiscal 2008 includes the highly anticipated titles Grand Theft Auto IV, Midnight Club: Los Angeles, Bully: Scholarship Edition, our complete Sports lineup and Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution. We also recently announced Borderlands, our first person shooter from legendary game developer Gearbox Software. ", "Looking further out to 2009, we have announced Mafia 2, the sequel to the original title that sold over 2 million units. We are also developing L.A. Noire and Beaterator. We have moved those titles out of fiscal 2008. We will have more to say about our fiscal 2009 pipeline over the coming months.", "Turning back to the reception of our games, our teams recently returned from the Games Convention in Leipzig where we received a terrific response to our upcoming titles. 2K showcased Borderlands, Mafia 2 and Civilization Revolution along with our Sports titles to a very enthusiastic audience. We think the initial gamer response is really promising for these highly anticipated titles.", "Rockstar debut Table Tennis for the Wii at the convention, and Leipzig was also part of our worldwide launch of the highly anticipated Midnight Club: Los Angeles. We demoed the game to European retailers, the press and almost 200,000 consumers on the show floor. We also unveiled the title to the U.S. press in San Francisco, to consumers at the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle and to retailers and press in Sydney; it's been a busy time. Judging from the action of worldwide press, retailers and consumers, we think this title will be the best in the racing genre, both critically and commercially. I should note that our Midnight Club franchise has been extremely successful; it sold over 11 million units to date. Our latest version in the title Midnight Club III has already sold 6 million units.", "Finally, I would like to comment on our outlook for 2K Sports. Based on our assumptions and market outlook, we are budgeting for our sports business to be profitable next year. We think this has been an under -appreciated asset of Take-Two and we made the decision early on to continue our commitment to producing high quality Sports titles. It is gratifying to be able to report that our investment in Sports is already close to contributing to the bottom line in fiscal 2007, and budgeted to be profitable in fiscal 2008. We anticipate increased profitability of the business as it scales up.", "From the start of our involvement with Take-Two, we believed this could be the most creative and innovative company in our industry. We feel even more confident that is the case now. We are also working hard to make it the most efficient. ", "I would like to turn the call over to Ben.", "Ben Feder", "Thanks, Strauss. As Strauss mentioned, Take-Two has made progress on a number of fronts in the third quarter. I will detail that progress in the next few minutes. Some of the developments that I will discuss have been announced previously, although it is worth recapping them to give you a perspective on how much we have accomplished in a short time.", "One of our priorities has been to identify alternatives for non-core businesses. We announced on Friday the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Joytech Video Game Accessories business to Mad Catz Interactive. While this was a small deal, it represents a significant milestone in our restructuring efforts. ", "With respect to the Jack Of All Games business, we have entertained a variety of alternatives. We haven't found one that makes economic sense for Take-Two. While we remain open to other alternatives, we plan to operate the business for the foreseeable future in a way that will optimize its performance and take advantage of distribution opportunities and growth in the next gen environment. This business is profitable and we expect that to continue. ", "We continue to work with the Manhattan District Attorney and the SEC toward a resolution of any outstanding matters. You have all seen the announcement last month that Take-Two received a Wells Notice from the SEC. It's important to note and I want to emphasize that the alleged conduct that was the source of the SEC action ceased approximately four years ago, and that none of the individuals said to be involved are employed by the company today. The Wells Notice was anticipated and reflects our continuing dialogue with the SEC staff. We hope and expect to resolve this matter to a settlement rather than to contested litigation of the charges, and we believe the Wells Notice represents a significant step forward toward resolution.", "I will remind you that professional fees and legal expenses related to the District Attorney and the SEC investigations consumer class action and other regulatory and litigation issues were approximately $15 million year-to-date so the progress we are making in resolving these matters is meaningful to our financial performance. ", "I particularly want to emphasize our success in broadening and diversifying our product portfolio. Today the company can claim more top-tier franchises than at any time in its history. In addition to Grand Theft Auto, our roster of million-plus wholly owned brands includes BioShock, Civilization, Midnight Club, Max Payne, Red Dead Revolver, Manhunt and Bully. We fully intend to leverage these products which are on development cycles that should complement and counterbalance each other. We also have the recurring revenue streams which we expect to be profitable from our Sports business. ", "As Strauss noted earlier, our commitment is to ensure that Take-Two is the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient company in our industry. Our progress during the third quarter, divesting of non-core assets, pursuing the resolution of regulatory litigation issues, and importantly, adding to our hit-driven creative portfolio shows how serious we are about that commitment. We believe that the single most important value creator in the future will be growing Take-Two's major game franchises and creating new ones. Our focus in the months and years ahead will be growth and diversity of our major game franchises. ", "Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lainie who will review our financial results.", " Lainie Goldstein ", "Thanks, Ben and good afternoon everyone. I will be covering several topics today. First I will review our third quarter results; second, our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2007; and third, our initial guidance for fiscal 2008. ", "Now to our Q3 results. Net revenue was $206 million compared with $241 million a year ago. Our non-GAAP net loss, which excludes unusual charges and stock-based compensation, was $46 million compared to $19 million last year. Non-GAAP net loss per share in Q3 was $0.64 per share compared to a net loss per share of $0.27 last year.", "Our GAAP results, which include a total of $12.4 million in unusual charges and stock-based compensation expenses were a net loss of approximately $59 million or $0.81 per share. This compares to the net loss of $91 million or $1.29 per share in the third quarter of 2006. ", "Our 2007 Q3 net loss included a $13.5 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and caused us to realize no tax benefit for the carryforward tax effect of this loss. This compares to a $59.5 million valuation allowance in Q3 of last year. ", "Our decline in revenue year over year was primarily due to the strong sales last year of our Grand Theft Auto series, especially Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories for PS2 which shipped in June of last year. ", "Our leading titles this quarter were the Darkness, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, All-Pro Football 2K8 and the BIGS. Our sports business was once again a strong contributor to revenue. Sports titles represented about 28% of our publishing revenue in the third quarter. Looking at the breakdown of our total revenue, the mix was 76% publishing, 24% distribution for the recent quarter compared to 80% publishing, 20% distribution in Q3 of last year. ", "Our distribution business was roughly flat compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Revenue from distribution of next-gen platforms increased due to the introduction of the Playstation 3 and Wii during our current fiscal year. This is offset by the decline in volume in average selling prices of legacy platform titles along with reduced sales and lower margins for PC titles this year. ", "Looking at our consolidated results, our total gross profit margin for the quarter decreased this year to 18.5% compared to 23.7% last year. This decrease is mainly due to our distribution business being a greater percentage of our overall revenue and higher license cost from the larger number of licensed titles sold this quarter compared to last year when our Grand Theft Auto titles were a significant percentage of revenue.", "Relative to our Q3 results, we expect gross profit margins to increase in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2008 as our revenue mix shifts towards internally developed, wholly owned title. Our operating expenses in the third quarter were approximately $95 million, down almost $9 million from last year's third quarter. Operating expenses decreased in all areas except depreciation and amortization, which was up slightly, and selling and marketing which increased as a result of our new All-Pro Football, Stakes and Darkness franchises. ", "G&A fell by approximately $9 million year-over-year due to lower stock-based compensation as a result of the departure of our former management team and savings realized from our development studio closures last year. Also, last year's third quarter included some unusual charges for our stock option investigation, studio closures and certain relocation costs. ", "R&D expenses declined by $6 million year over year driven by the studio closures last year, and higher software capitalization rates this year for next-gen platforms. Additionally, last year's Q3 R&D numbers included some charges related to our studio closures. We also reported $8.5 million in impairment charges last year, primarily related to JoyTech . In this year's third quarter, we incurred business reorganization and related expenses of $7.1 million, due to our cost savings initiatives and management changes. ", "The last area of discussion on our income statement relates to taxes. As a reminder and as we've discussed on previous calls, in light of our domestic cumulative losses for the past three years, we are required under FASB 109 to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, our effective tax rate was negative 4% in the third quarter. It's important to note that as we generate taxable income in the U.S. in future periods, we will be able to recapture these deductions and have a lower than normal effective tax rate.", "Moving onto to our balance sheet, at the end of Q3 we had approximately $51.6 million in cash and $11 million of borrowings on our $100 million credit line, with $89 million available under the line. Our overall cash position was solid at the end of Q3; the majority of our cash balance was in Europe. We drew down on our lines because repatriating cash to US is not currently tax efficient. ", "We have had several questions about liquidity and so we would like to address the issue here. We manage cash utilization in a disciplined manner and have taken into account the expected timing of releases including strong cash-generating titles like Grand Theft Auto IV and BioShock. While the recent change in our release schedule affected our near-term cash flow forecast, other than timing, our financial position has not changed. We have our $100 million credit line to fund periodic working capital needs. We will continue to tap into that line as needed. We plan to draw down on the line further in the fourth quarter, so you can expect to see a greater utilization of the line at the end of our fiscal year. We believe that should our business needs or growth opportunities require additional financing in the future, there are various additional liquidity sources available to us. In any event, we will make any determinations regarding financing based on the best interest of all our shareholders. ", "Our accounts receivable reserve stood at about $66 million at end of the quarter, representing approximately 40% of gross receivables. Our Q3 reserves were approximately 16% of trailing six months revenue and about 10% of trailing nine months revenue, about comparable to last year's Q3 level. ", "Inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately $76 million, down significantly from $96 million at year end and $83 million at Q3 last year, due to our reduced sales volume and continued focus on managing Jack's inventories level. ", "The increase in our software development costs and licenses is primarily related to the key title planned for release over the next 12 to 24 months, including Grand Theft Auto IV, L.A. Noire, BioShock, Midnight Club: Los Angeles and Manhunt 2. We currently have over 35 titles in various stages of development on current and next-gen platform. ", "Now to our guidance. For fiscal 2007, we are reiterating the Q4 guidance we previously provided which is detailed in our press release. For fiscal 2008, we are issuing initial guidance today. For the full year, we expect earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.50 on a non-GAAP basis; $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in revenue. This excludes stock-based compensation expense of $0.45 per share and reorganization and restructuring charges and unusual professional fees and legal expenses of $0.05 per share. On a GAAP basis, EPS to be $0.80 to $1. Additionally, fiscal 2008 estimates reflect tax expense attributable to the company's international operations and the benefit of the partial reversal of the valuation allowance previously reported against deferred tax assets. ", "Let me provide some additional data points on our 2008 outlook. We expect our total revenue mix to be split about 80% publishing and 20% distribution as compared to fiscal 2007, the projected mix of business and publishing will be more favorable from a margin standpoint. On a blended basis for publishing and distribution, we expect gross margins for fiscal 2008 to be about 35%. We expect our split between North America and international revenue to be about 75% to 25%, excluding our Sports and distribution business, our North America and international split is two-thirds to one-third. ", "Within publishing, we expect the relative breakdown for our four key publishing labels to be roughly 60% from Rockstar, 25% from 2K Sports, and 15% from 2K Games and 2K Play. A significant portion of Rockstar's revenue will come from our premium priced titles Grand Theft Auto IV and Midnight Club: Los Angeles on next-gen platforms, compared to 2007, when a large part of Rockstar's business was lower-priced catalog products on current-gen platforms. ", "For 2K Games, we expect a greater percentage of sales to come from higher margin, internally owned and developed titles led by BioShock and Civilization Revolution. In 2K Sports we expect to realize our first year of profitability on a label level in fiscal 2008. This assumption is driven by several factors. First, we will be expanding our range of non-licensed sports titles into additional categories with titles like Top Spin 3. Second, we are driving our continued market share gains relative to our competitors in our NBA and College Basketball titles where we compete head to head against lower rated titles. Lastly, we expect to see a continued ramp up in the next-gen installed base going forward and consequently, the greater percentage of our sales at higher software price points, which will favorably impact our profit margins. ", "Now let me give you an idea of where we see our operating expenses trending. We're coming off of a recent period of high G&A spend, based on some of the regulatory challenges we've had, along with our business reorganization. We see 2008 G&A levels improving by approximately 10% in absolute dollars compared to 2007, based on reduced personnel expenses following our restructuring and decreased professional fees, as we resolve some of our outstanding regulatory issues. ", "Sales and marketing is closely tied to our product releases. We expect a larger marketing spend in absolute dollars in 2008, while holding relatively stable as a percentage of sales. R&D will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the products in development. On an annual basis, we expect R&D expenses to increase about 25% due to headcount additions and the higher number of internally developed games in our pipeline. Depreciation and amortization should increase modestly. Based on our current forecast, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 10% in 2008. ", "To give a bit more color on Q1, we plan to release College Hoops 2K8, Bully's Scholarship Edition and our new Nick Jr. Dora the Explorer and Go, Diego, Go! titles. We also expect continuing strong sales from our Q4 releases including BioShock, Manhunt 2, Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis, Carnival Games and NBA 2K8.", "To summarize, we see additional opportunities to capitalize on the strength of our core franchises and our sports business in fiscal 2008. The benefit of our restructuring will be fully realized by the end of next year. Taking these factors together, we believe we can show a meaningful improvement in our operating performance in 2008.", "Looking at fiscal 2009 in general terms, we are laying the groundwork to further improve on our expected fiscal 2008 performance. We now have a baseline of recurring annual products in our sports business with our MLB, NBA and NHL titles complemented by our non-licensed titles in other categories including tennis, football and boxing. In addition, we have developed several triple A multi-million unit selling franchises to provide balance in years without a major Grand Theft Auto release; franchises like Midnight Club, Civilization and BioShock. We also have million unit plus selling franchises including Max Payne, Bully, Manhunt and Red Dead Revolver, which provide incremental revenue opportunity and we expect to add to that strong revenue base with new titles.", "At this point I will turn the call back to Strauss.", " Strauss Zelnick ", "Thanks, Lainie. I'd like to conclude by saying that we are very pleased with our recent accomplishments and we look forward to reporting further progress in the months ahead that we believe will lead to profitability and enhance shareholder value. ", "We will now take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse. ", " Heath Terry - Credit Suisse ", "Lainie, of the 35 titles that you mentioned in development, can you give us a breakdown on where those fall, even roughly, between the two fiscal years and which labels we should anticipate those coming under?", "Lainie Goldstein", "I don't have that detail in front of me, Heath. We can give you an estimate if you give Cindi a call I think we can give you a little more guidance in that area.", " Heath Terry - Credit Suisse ", "On the relationship with Nickelodeon, I know you'd mentioned a couple of the titles that this is going to impact with Dora the Explorer and Go, Diego, Go! but given that they obviously have another big videogame relationship, as they develop new titles and as you start to work with them on this, are there additional titles that you can talk about or how many games do you expect to do under this relationship on an ongoing basis?", "Ben Feder", "We can't really talk about any titles other than the ones we have announced. We are excited about our relationship with Nickelodeon. I hope they are excited about doing business with us. I think if you had to parse some of the titles that we are doing versus some of the titles that another video game company is doing, you would see a lower age bracket for us, consistent with our 2K Play announcement. We are hopeful that this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship with Nickelodeon. Beyond that, we can\u2019t really comment on any further titles.", " Heath Terry - Credit Suisse ", "And then I know you mentioned the 1.5 million that BioShock has shipped into retail. Can you give us an idea just on the latest data that you\u2019ve got on how closely that matches up with the sell through you have seen so far?", "Ben Feder", "Sell through is pretty terrific. We are not releasing sell through today. I will say that we think it is one of the fastest selling games in video game history. It\u2019s sell through is great, we are thankful that the replenishment rate is pretty quick so that we can go back to the manufacturers and get it out to the marketplace as quickly as they have sold through. But we are very, very pleased with that. We can\u2019t disclose a number today, but we are very pleased with sell through. In fact, we are ecstatic. ", " Heath Terry - Credit Suisse ", "Given that this is a 2K title and not a Rockstar title, is it fair to assume that you will see a higher margin associated with this title versus some of the others? ", "Ben Feder", "Yes, we do. I mean other than what we are paying to the hardware manufacturers, there are virtually no royalties associated with those titles. It all goes to the bottom line. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Savner - Banc of America Securities. ", "Michael Savner - Banc of America Securities", "Lainie, can you go into a little more detail? I'm sure I understood the answer to your prepared remarks on liquidity. If we look at the financials and the guidance you provided today and the cash obligations that we know about through your filings, it does seem very likely that you will need additional liquidity. So first, is that correct in that assumption and if so, can you be little bit more specific on your ideal source of additional liquidity? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "I can\u2019t agree with you on that. We really manage our cash very carefully, we look at our cash flow all the time. We have a lot of moving parts and a lot of great titles that are coming out. We are going to look at other opportunities as it make sense for us based on growing our business going forward, but it's not necessarily that we have to get additional liquidity.", "Michael Savner - Banc of America Securities", "So if you don\u2019t agree that means that you think you are in good shape, and that is fine. Second, can you just give a bit more granularity on how you are feeling about the baseball license? Any update in terms of renegotiation on that license? Then, with Pro Football, what have you learned from the release this fall? Anything you would change next time, if you are still pleased with your move into football?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We don't comment on ongoing discussions with third parties and we don't have anything to announce at this time. We do feel good in general about our relationships with all of our licensors and as you heard today, we feel particularly confident about where our sports business is going. ", "In terms of all Pro Football, I think the game is great. It\u2019s performance has not been as stellar as we would have liked. We still think there is plenty of opportunity to sell that and as we head into the holiday season and as the installed base grows. Given the competitive landscape, we continue to believe that by making games that rate higher than the competitors, consumers will follow and certainly that is the case in the other sports in which we make games and we feel that can be true in football as well.", "Sports is proving to be a positive bet for the company, the momentum is strong, the wins are back, so we feel good about it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Taylor - Arcadia. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "The guidance range has a delta of $300 million and the EPS range is not that affected apparently by that. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the high lows and maybe what the key variables are in there that we ought to keep in mind? I am particularly interested in the low revenue number and the low EPS number. ", "Ben Feder", "Actually no, the bottom line tracks the top line if you take a look at our historical margins and the industry margins, it actually tracks pretty well. I think the risks are sort of obvious. I would say the biggest risk is what the installed basis and we feel otherwise that we are looking at it reasonably conservative. But clearly the elements are how do our key releases perform? How does our catalog perform? How do consumers pick up the hardware platforms?", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "The key pickups, the reversals and negatives, if you will next year, are hopefully the elimination of some of the G&A and then the turnaround on the tax line. Is there another big one in there? ", "Ben Feder", "No. There really isn't. I mean, we are looking at a very strong release schedule and as you pointed out, our costs are declining as are our one-time expenses. This is all news that we previously released and emphasized today. As I said, we are going from fixing the company to building the company and our results are going to look a lot more like industry results in '08, the results of a company that has hit franchises. That's what our numbers are going to look like and frankly our margins are going to look a lot like that too. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "I wonder if you could give us an estimate of what the capitalized lines are going to look like on the balance sheet at fiscal year end and I am also interested in roughly, how much you are going to amortize from what you entered the fourth quarter with for BioShock as you ship that out?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We don't give that detailed information JT, so I don't have that to share with you today. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "Not even a forecasted grand total? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "No. We have never given that out. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "Can you give me guesstimate or a forecast on cash flow from ops for the year or for the fourth quarter? ", "Ben Feder", "We just announce our cash balances at the quarter. We don't do interim announcements, we just gave you information on Q3 and we also gave information on our general view of liquidity, which is positive. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "Could you breakdown the inventory between publishing and distribution?", "Lainie Goldstein", "It's about that 60% for distribution and 40% for publishing. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "60% of the total is distribution? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Urban - Bear Stearns. ", "Edward Urban - Bear Stearns", "I just wanted to follow quickly on gross margin. Lainie, you mentioned your fiscal '08 gross margin estimates, and I'm just wondering -- does that guidance imply a gain on the royalty line, or where do you see the most leverage there?", " Lainie Goldstein", "Mostly we see it coming out with internally developed titles next year versus licensed and externally developed titles in '08.", "Edward Urban - Bear Stearns", "So at this point you're not forecasting much in the way of gains on the royalty line?", " Lainie Goldstein", "No.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Douglas Krupp - Cowen and Co.", " Douglas Krupp - Cowen and Co.", "Could you discuss a little bit the decision to push L.A. Noire and Beaterator out of fiscal '08? Is that something we could expect to see at the beginning of fiscal '09 before the holiday, or later on?", " Strauss Zelnick", "We're still developing the titles, and we don't sense here that they will be ready in '08, so right now we're just pushing out the release date and we will be more specific as we have more information. But we are continuing to develop titles. I think our decision was driven in part by the fact that we have such a strong release schedule for '08 and a pretty robust one.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets.", " Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "First of all, looking at the release schedule you provided for fiscal '08, how comprehensive is this relative to what is in your guidance? Can you give us an idea as to how many more titles may be in the year or the timing of those titles within the year?", " Strauss Zelnick", "It is about 80%, and obviously our big titles that we expect are in here.", " Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Then with regard to the flow of the revenues in fiscal '08, obviously we're looking at GTA 4 coming in the second quarter. Besides that, can you give us an idea as to how the third or fourth quarters may differ in '08 versus '07?", " Lainie Goldstein", "We're not ready to share that information yet. We are not giving out quarterly guidance. But hopefully by the next earnings release we will be ready to share that information.", " Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "You will be able to give us some of the key drive titles in each given quarter?", " Lainie Goldstein", "Right.", " Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Then looking at Sports quickly for a moment, I think the implication that you have is about $250 million in sports revenue in '08. Can you give us an idea as to how that compares to the expectations for '07?", "Ben Feder", "I think the answer is we expect it to grow '08 over '07, but we don't break it out. I'm actually not going to comment on your estimate, except to say that we do expect '08 to be a better year than '07. Things are going in the right direction.", " Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "With regards to All-Pro Football, can you give us an idea as to what your plans are with that franchise as far as an annual iteration or if that is something that could come every other year?", "Ben Feder", "I hope is that it is an annual iteration. We are looking at it. We intend to ship that next year, although we're looking at it carefully. The performance isn't what we expected it to be, although we believe strategically it is important to have football out there in the marketplace as a key competitor in the marketplace. So in looking at a release we're looking at price points, we are looking at the number of ways of being more successful the next time it comes out.", " Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Then last question with regards to Manhunt 2, have you gotten any feedback from retailers in the U.S. that they will not carry the game?", " Strauss Zelnick", "Certainly not. It is rated M. There's a whole lot of enthusiasm for the title, as there should be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Handler - Lehman Brothers.", " Eric Handler - Lehman Brothers", "You have a big jump in stock comp next year. Is that purely a function of management's recent award of 2% of all the stock outstanding, or is there anything else in there?", "Secondly, when you look at your guidance for next year, if you achieve within that range, what type of free cash flow do you figure you can get off of that type of net income?", " Strauss Zelnick", "In terms of your first question yes, it is largely driven by the recent formalization of the ZelnickMedia grants. It also includes stock compensation for development employees, which is amortized as the titles are released. ", "On your second point, you can draw your own conclusions. We actually don't project cash flow. Clearly we do expect 2008 to be a very strong and successful year across all meaningful criteria.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research.", " Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "First, on 2K Play, can you talk about when that process began to formulate that new label, and what resources you are putting in place and what additional resources do you think you'll be putting in there in terms of the number of people working on the label and the amount of titles that might be possible to put out in the next fiscal year or two?", "Secondly, for fiscal '08 the $0.05 seems relatively light. I guess that implies that you are wrapping most of this up this fiscal year. Maybe you could just comment about where you are in that process that you have outlined. Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks for the questions. In terms of your first question, 2K Play, the origination came just as we came into the company. It was part of the restructuring thinking as we tried to reorganize the company around a label-oriented structure. Quite frankly, this is mostly Global Star being folded into 2K. It takes advantage of a lot of our current infrastructure. The deal with Nickelodeon is something that we negotiated during that restructuring process. Carnival Games was already in place. ", "But we are committed to the label for primarily two reasons. One is we're committed to diversifying the product set and the other is we think that casual games is a growth area for the industry and a growth area for Take-Two. But between the diversifying the product set, commitment to casual gaming, the set of assets and infrastructure that we already had in place, we thought it was a good marriage. Putting it under Take-Two gave us a lot of operating efficiency.", "With respect to litigation we can't really speak for the District Attorney and we can't speak for the SEC. We can't speak for anybody that is a counterparty to any one of our agreements, frankly. I think Seth is doing a terrific job moving these along as quickly as we can, given that we obviously want to put it behind us on the one hand, but want to act in the interest of shareholders on the other. I'm pleased with the progress. When we have something to report obviously we will, but I can't say anything more than that.", " Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "I meant more along the lines of the charges. If you spent $15 million year-to-date and next year the number is $3.7 million.", " Strauss Zelnick", "If I could unpack that for you, frankly, I think part of that $15 million is related to litigation, with respect directly to litigation. Part of that $15 million is related to a lot of outside counsel, a lot of disorganization frankly around managing all of that. Since the arrival of Seth we have managed to get our arms around that. It hasn't been easy, but we are getting our arms around it. We're managing it carefully. While we're not providing apples-to-apples, if we were fully organized around outside counsel and litigation, what would it be this year versus last year but I would say even if the level of legal activity were the same as it were last year, we would expect a significant reduction of legal expenses based on the work that Seth has been doing at the company. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben Schachter - UBS Securities.", " Ben Schachter - UBS Securities", "I am wondering a little longer term if you could talk about the brand equity of Grand Theft Auto, how you're going to play that out across various SKUs and various platforms? Really, how do you walk that fine line of producing a lot of titles around this great franchise, but not overstepping it and sort of saturating the market? Really the same question for BioShock, have you thought about that in terms of how far you can bring this franchise to some other platforms, other SKUs? Thanks.", " Strauss Zelnick", "I think one of the ways that we do it is and we have shown this already in practice, is that we're driven by making the best interactive entertainment that anyone makes and being passionate about what we do and bringing it to market when it is ready; not just having a release date on a calendar and putting something in the box on that date. I think that is the first point. ", "I would say just generally speaking what GTA has done has typically been on a release program that is no more frequent than every two years. Some of our competitors for some franchises tend to be really driven by an annual calendar. While the sports business certainly is now an annual calendar business for most titles -- not all, but most -- that is just not true of other interactive entertainment titles from our point of view. We think that there is this balance, not only in terms of how long it takes to develop an A+ title, which is its own sort of internal mechanism that we can't control entirely, it falls into the category we will sell no wine before its time. ", "But there is also an issue of how do you whet the consumers' appetite and yet keep a franchise alive? We don't tend to think that the best way to do that is necessarily on a lock step annual schedule. If development weren't an issue and a concern, and it didn't come first and foremost to us, this notion of being the most creative company and the most innovative company is crucial to our strategy. If it weren't, I would say probably roughly an every three year schedule would be optimal. If you look historically, that has been largely the case for GTA.", "I expect we would apply roughly the same strategy to BioShock, because BioShock is shaping up to be a very important franchise. I don't want to say more than that about BioShock because I certainly don't want to jinx it, but I feel awfully good about where that is going.", " Ben Schachter - UBS Securities", "Is there anything for other platforms, aside from the next gen console, would you expect a new GTA on a PSP or DS or anything like that? And the same question for BioShock?", " Strauss Zelnick", "I think the answer is to the extent that a platform makes sense and there is a base for it and we can deliver a real really high quality product for it, we have a very open mind. We have relationships with all the console producers. Obviously being broader in terms of console penetration is better for the company. But -- and it is a significant but -- not if the title is compromised. We don't tend to believe in simple ports, throw them in the box and ship them. We want every title to stand on its own and to be a terrific piece of creative entertainment.", "Ben Feder", "I would also say, bear in mind BioShock has been out for three weeks now. We are thrilled with the success, and it has gone beyond our expectations. So give us a little bit of time. The other thing is that Strauss and I have been managing brands for a long, long time. We're not managers that trash the brand to get a short-term hit. So if the expectation is we're going to do what we can and just milk it as quickly as we can, that is not our intention. Our intention is to build long-term brands and long-term franchise value for the company.", " Ben Schachter - UBS Securities", "Do you expect to be having any new titles for PS2 going forward? Thanks.", "Ben Feder", "Look, we know that PS2 has longer legs than people expected. Manhunt is coming out for PS2. We're excited about that. But going forward our platforms are going to be primarily focused on next gen. We think of Take-Two as being a triple-A company, triple-A titles for next gen is going to drive this business. As we said early on when we got to the company, in addition to being a Microsoft and Sony shop, we are also interested in making inroads into the Nintendo world. You'll see a strong pipeline of Wii products and DS products, and we expect to exploit those platforms as well.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue.

(Operator Instructions)It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Cindy Buckwalter, ExecutiveVice President for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you, Ms. Buckwalter. You maybegin. ", "Cindy Buckwalter", "Thank you. Welcome and thank you all for joining us today.Today\u2019s call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Chairman of Take-Two; Ben Feder,our CEO; and Lainie Goldstein, our CFO. We are also joined by Seth Krauss, ourChief Legal Counsel. The team will be available to answer your questions duringthe Q&A session following our prepared remarks. ", "Before we begin, I would first like to quickly review ourSafe Harbor statement by reminding everyone that the statements made duringthis call that are not historical facts are considered forward-lookingstatements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements arebased on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by andinformation currently available to us. Actual operating results may varysignificant from these forward-looking statements based on a variety offactors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC,including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, and our 10-Q forthe third quarter ended July 31, 2007, which are both available on our websiteor by contacting the SEC. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Cindy and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks forjoining us. I believe fiscal 2007 will largely be remembered as a year in whichTake-Two made significant progress on initiatives that will provide a solid foundationfor our future. As a result, we\u2019ve begun fiscal 2008 as a stronger organizationthan we have been in the past, with a sharp focus on being the most creative,the most innovative, and the most efficient company in our industry. ", "Before I turn the call over to Ben and Lainie, I would liketo review some of the reasons why we believe Take-Two is so well-positioned forthis fiscal year and beyond. First, we believe we have the strongest portfolioof owned product franchises in our business and at the same time, we\u2019veexpanded and diversified these franchises to include 15 proprietary brands,such as Grand Theft Auto, Bioshock, Midnight Club, Bully, Red Dead Revolver,Manhunt, Civilization, Carnival Games, and others. We also have a promisingsports business along with our recent entry into casual games, 2K Play. Perhapseven more importantly, we have the most talented creative teams in theindustry. We\u2019re very proud of that. ", "The recent consolidation activity in this business clearlydemonstrates the importance and value of owned intellectual property, the goldstandard of our business. We\u2019ve created a more streamlined and efficientorganization through our restructuring and revitalization efforts. As a result,Take-Two is sharply focused on our core publishing business and better equippedto support the potential of our creative teams. Coupled with that is asubstantially reduced cost structure, the benefits of which will be more fullyrealized this fiscal year. ", "We\u2019ve worked diligently to resolve the distractions ofvarious regulatory and litigation issues. Most recently, we announced aproposed settlement of all consumer class action lawsuits pending in the U.S.relating to the so-called Hot Coffee modification. Along with our progress inthese and other areas, we anticipate significantly stronger operating andfinancial performance in fiscal 2008. ", "As Lainie will discuss in greater detail, we are reiteratingour guidance for full year earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.50 ona non-GAAP basis on $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in revenue. We are alsoproviding guidance for our first quarter. ", "In summary, we begin fiscal 2008 with great confidence inour competitive position and in our potential for profitable growth. We\u2019vearrived at this point just as the video game industry is poised to reap thebenefits of the cycle that began in 2005. As the installed base of nextgeneration hardware continues to grow and the sales of video games reach newheights, we have the products, the processes, and the people to take maximumadvantage of the opportunities in our market. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Ben. ", "Benjamin Feder", "I\u2019d like to comment briefly on our Q4 results and thecurrent holiday season and then I\u2019ll elaborate on our accomplishments in a fewareas that Strauss just touched upon. ", "We\u2019re thrilled that our Q4 bottom line performance wasbetter than expected. This is the second quarter in a row that we beat ourguidance. On a non-GAAP basis, this is the first quarter in some time in whichTake-Two was profitable without a new Grand Theft Auto release. ", "We beat our guidance primarily on the strength ofbetter-than-anticipated sales on internally developed titles, particularlyBioshock and Carnival Games. Product mix of Jack of All Games was also morefavorable as we worked hard to expand margins in that business. As you cantell, the revitalization of Take-Two is well underway. ", "Looking to Q1, we have a very light new release schedule,with the majority of our business coming from catalog titles, so I view Q1 as atime to prepare for the next nine months of the year, which we expect to seesignificant growth. ", "Overall, I\u2019d say the sales trends for holiday 2007 appear toreinforce the overall strength of our industry as video games continue to beamong the must-have gifts this season. This bodes well for the long-termprospects of our industry in general and Take-Two in particular. ", "I\u2019d characterize our performance this season assatisfactory, especially in light of the fact that our holiday sales areprimarily driven by catalog titles. But our ambitions are to do much, muchbetter. ", "Now let me turn to some of our recent product developments.We released new downloadable content for Bioshock, which will make the new gameplay experience even more compelling than it already is. This new internallyowned and developed franchise has shipped over 2 million units and has wonmultiple awards. ", "Both the Associated Press and the British Academy of Filmand Television named Bioshock Game of the Year for 2007, and at last week\u2019sSpike TV video game awards, Bioshock took home more awards than any othertitle, winning Game of the Year, Best Xbox 360 game, and Best Original Score.This is a great new franchise for Take-Two, upon which we plan to build. ", "Rockstar just released Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Storieson PS2 and PSP in Japan and the title achieved greatest hits status on PSP lastmonth. From 2K Play, we\u2019re thrilled with the enthusiastic consumer reception toCarnival Games, a great family title. It was the number one third party Wiititle in September, the number two third party Wii title in October, andremained a top 10 title in November. ", "We\u2019ve already shipped over half a million units worldwideand are seeing sustained demand for the title, and we expect the title tocontinue to perform well after the holidays. We plan to extend the success ofCarnival Games by bringing it to the DS platform this summer. ", "Moving to sports, the performance at NBA 2K8 was very, verysolid. The Xbox 360 title outrated the competition and outsold it by almostthree to one in its first three months on the market, according to NPD. ", "Looking at the balance of fiscal 2008, we\u2019re extremelyoptimistic. We are eagerly anticipating the release of Grand Theft Auto IV inour second quarter. By now, I hope most of you have seen the third trailer thatRockstar unveiled several weeks ago along with the box art. The game looksterrific and we\u2019re confident that it will be every bit as groundbreaking as theprevious titles. ", "Our strong pipeline for 2008 also includes other titles --Midnight Club Los Angeles, episodic content for Grand Theft Auto IV, Bully:Scholarship Edition, Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization Revolution, Borderlands, TopThree, and our complete sports lineup. Many of the products in our fiscal 2008pipeline are sequels to well-established franchises, the prior versions ofwhich sold over 15 million units in aggregate, not counting Grand Theft Auto. ", "We are very excited about the potential for the 2008 lineup.We have significant revenue visibility with these proven brands. ", "Among our other new releases, 2K Play recently released thefirst products from its partnership with Nickelodeon -- Go Diego Go: SafariRescue and Dora the Explorer: Dora Saves the Mermaids, both on the Nintendo DS.These titles will also be shipping on console early next year. ", "2K\u2019s new title, Borderlands, was the exclusive cover storyin the September issue of Game Informer and is generating additional buzzfollowing the debut of the trailer on Spike TV\u2019s 2007 Video Game Awards.Borderlands has been named one of the top games for 2008 by Electronic GamingMonthly, Game Pro, and Games for Windows magazine. ", "Also for 2008, we are looking forward to Sid Meier\u2019sCivilization: Revolution, the game that Sid says he\u2019s always wanted to make.The game was built exclusively for console and handheld platforms and we arebringing it to Xbox 360, PS3, and DS. The title is already getting positivefeedback from both consumers and the press after our play test at the E For AllConsumer Game Show this past October. ", "In sports, we\u2019ll be expanding our lineup with Don KingPresents Prizefighter, a new boxing title that we announced last week for Xbox360, Wii, and DS. We are also looking forward to Major League Baseball 2K8 inthe spring, with Mets shortstop Jose Reyes as our cover athlete. ", "Looking into fiscal 2009, the buzz is building already forMafia 2, the sequel to our 2 million unit bestseller. The title is alreadygenerating gamer and press interest after the debut of the cinematic Mafia 2teaser trailer at this year\u2019s game convention in Leipzig, Germany. ", "In fiscal 2009, we\u2019ll also be offering additional episodiccontent for Grand Theft Auto IV in Xbox 360 and you can expect to see sequelsof some of our big franchises. You\u2019ll recall that our goal is to balance outthe major releases throughout the year and we\u2019ll have more to say about ourfiscal 2009 pipeline in the months ahead. ", "We\u2019ve said a lot about our focus on creating ownedintellectual property and we\u2019ve recently established a new studio, 2K Marin, inNovato, California. This studio will develop original IP and also co-developproducts with other 2K studios around the world. This move reflects ourcommitment to create and leverage triple A franchises. ", "To strengthen our focus on a number of critical operatingareas, we recently named Gary Dale to a corporate role as Executive VicePresident to Take-Two. In his new position, Gary will head up our efforts tocapture opportunities in emerging areas, such as online gaming and casualgames, as well as in critical regions of the world, Asia-Pacific and LatinAmerica. His experience and relationships in Europe will also be valuable incontinuing to grow our business in that critical market. Gary will also overseeour sales organizations. ", "We\u2019re thrilled with our Q4 performance and our progress todate. We believe that fiscal 2008 will demonstrate the value of our efforts torevitalize the business, make our organization more efficient, and focus onwhat Take-Two does best -- creating powerful game franchises. We look forwardto reporting on our progress throughout the coming year. Lainie. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Ben and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll be coveringseveral topics today. First, a review of fourth quarter results; second, ouroutlook for fiscal 2008; and third, our guidance for the first quarter. ", "Let\u2019s look at our Q4 results. Net revenue was $293 million,compared with $267 million a year ago. We\u2019re pleased that we were profitable inthe quarter on a non-GAAP basis and that we exceeded our guidance for a secondquarter in a row. This is the first quarter in quite some time that Take-Twowas profitable without a new Grand Theft Auto release. ", "Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 million compared to a non-GAAPnet loss of $1.8 million last year, with earnings per share of $0.05 comparedto a loss per share of $0.03 last year. ", "Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter were a net loss ofapproximately $7 million, or $0.10 per share, compared with a loss of $14million or $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. ", "Our GAAP results included $4.8 million in stock-basedcompensation expenses and a total of $3 million in business reorganization andexpenses related to unusual legal matters. Additionally, we realized a $3.1million loss on the sale of Joytech and a $1.4 million loss on thede-consolidation of Blue Castle Games, a developer of some of our sportstitles. ", "Let me explain that a little bit further. We had previouslyaccounted for Blue Castle as a wholly-owned subsidiary in accordance withFIN-46. While Blue Castle continues to develop some of our sports titles, weare no longer their primary source of funding, which has resulted in having tode-consolidate their assets. ", "Our increase in revenue year over year was primarily due tostrong sales of our newly released titles, led by Bioshock, NBA 2K8, andCarnival Games. Grand Theft Auto catalog sales were also a significant factorin the quarter\u2019s results. Our sports business was once again a strongcontributor to revenue. Sports represented about 20% of our publishing revenuein the quarter, and Jack of All Games business also grew, led by strongnext-gen hardware and software sales. ", "Looking at the breakdown of our total revenue, the mix was75% publishing, 25% distribution, about the same as Q4 of last year. Andlooking at our consolidated results, our total gross profit margin for thequarter was 30.6%, which was also comparable to last year. ", "Our split between North America and international revenuewas 74% to 26% in Q4. It\u2019s important to point out that our sports anddistribution businesses skewed these numbers relative to our peers. Thesebusinesses are primarily North American based. If you back out sports and distribution,our North America/international revenue split was about 60% to 40% in Q4 and57% to 43% for fiscal 2007. ", "Our operating expenses in the fourth quarter wereapproximately $87 million, down significantly from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.Operating expenses decreased in all areas except business reorganization, asthe restructuring began in the second quarter this year. ", "Sales and marketing expenses accounted for the largestreduction year over year, due to our lighter release schedule. ", "Relative to taxes, we are not showing any tax benefit on ourlosses. As we\u2019ve said on previous calls, due to our domestic cumulative lossesfor the past three years, we are required to record a valuation allowance toreduce our deferred tax asset. In fact, we had a provision for taxes in thefourth quarter only because we are a taxpayer in some of our internationalterritories. ", "Our full year results are detailed in the press release butI\u2019d like to just highlight a few areas of our performance. ", "We successfully initiated a $25 million cost reductionprogram. We\u2019ll see the full impact of these reductions by the end of fiscal2008. ", "We also established two important new franchises withBioshock and Carnival Games. Our sports business grew 20% year over year forthree reasons -- first, the additional titles we released in fiscal 2007compared to 2006; second, the improved performance of our Major League Baseballtitle; and third, the higher average software pricing relating to the largerinstalled base of next-gen hardware. ", "While sports was not profitable in 2007, we significantlyimproved the bottom line performance of the business this year. ", "Lastly, we showed revenue diversification in 2007 as our top10 titles were 27% of total company revenue, down from 38% in fiscal 2006 and48% in fiscal 2005. ", "These accomplishments demonstrate the progress we\u2019re makingon our strategic objectives. ", "Moving on to our balance sheet, as we announced last month,we expanded our credit line to $140 million in November. The expanded lineprovides additional flexibility to help continue to fund our working capitalneeds during the busy holiday season and beyond. ", "At the end of Q4, we had approximately $78 million in cashand $18 million of borrowings on our credit line. Based on our forecast of capsneeds, we expect to draw down on the line further in our Q1 but we anticipateno near-term need for additional capital beyond the credit line. ", "Our accounts receivable reserve was about $63 million at theend of the quarter. This represented approximately 38% of gross receivables.Inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately $99 million, which isrelatively comparable to Q4 of last year. ", "The increase in our software development costs and licensesis primarily related to the key titles planned for release over the next 12 to18 months. This includes Grand Theft Auto IV, Midnight Club Los Angeles, andBorderlands. We currently have approximately 30 titles in various stages ofdevelopment. ", "Now for our outlook for fiscal 2008. First, before we getinto the guidance details, I would like to emphasize that we are providingguidance on a non-GAAP basis, which we believe best represents our operatingperformance. It is also consistent with the way analyst estimates many of ourmajor competitors are afforded on First Call, excluding stock comp expenses andany unusual charges. ", "In contrast, the First Call estimates for Take-Twohistorically have been GAAP estimates, making it difficult to apply aconsistent valuation to companies industry-wide. Going forward, we wouldencourage all of the analysts to provide First Call and other reportingservices with non-GAAP estimates for Take-Two, just as you do for our industrypeers. ", "For fiscal 2008, we are reiterating the guidance wepreviously provided in September of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in revenue,and $1.30 to $1.50 per share on a non-GAAP basis. The assumptions underlyingthat guidance were provided in our Q3 conference call on September 10th andthose assumptions are still valid today. ", "Lastly, we are issuing guidance today for the first quarter.We expect a non-GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.50 to $0.60 on $175million to $225 million in revenue. This excludes stock-based compensationexpense of $0.07 per share and reorganization costs and expenses related tounusual legal matters of $0.02 per share. Our Q1 guidance reflects tax expenseattributable to the company\u2019s international operations only. ", "Let me describe some additional data points on our Q1outlook. We expect our revenue mix to be split equally between publishing anddistribution, due to the seasonal ramp-up in Jack\u2019s business and the increaseddemand they are seeing for next-gen hardware and software. We also expect Jacksales to increase from Q4 to Q1, although we anticipate a decrease comparedwith the first quarter last year. ", "For publishing, most of our business is coming from ourcatalog titles rather than new releases, so we are also expecting ourpublishing business to be down year over year in Q1. This will result inreduced gross profit margins compared to Q1 of last year. In fact, we expect Q1gross margins to be closer to what we experienced in fiscal 2007, about 25%. ", "We expect margins to trend back up in Q2 with the release ofGrand Theft Auto IV and then for the full year, we continue to expect grossmargins of approximately 35%. ", "We expect overall operating expenses to trend up a bit in Q1as compared to Q4, primarily driven by higher marketing spend as we prepare forour big 2008 releases. We also expect to see R&D expenses increase in Q1 ascompared to Q4, due to lower software capitalization rate during the holidayseason and some incremental IT spending. ", "G&A should also trend down modestly from Q4 anddepreciation and amortization should remain about flat. ", "As for taxes, we expect to show a provision for taxes in Q1for our international business only. ", "While it\u2019s early to talk about fiscal 2009, we can tell youthat we are building another robust release schedule. We are planning sequelsto some of Rockstar\u2019s and 2K\u2019s triple A brands and we\u2019ll also deliveradditional episodic content for Grand Theft Auto IV on Xbox 360. Rounding outour lineup will be our current sports business and titles based on several newbrands. 2009 will also reflect the first full year of our cost savingsinitiative. We are optimistic about our future and the opportunities to furtherbuild shareholder value. ", "At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Lainie. Let me conclude by saying that we arepleased with our progress during what was both a challenging and rewarding yearfor the company. Building and managing Take-Two is a team effort and I want tothank all of our colleagues here for their hard work and their dedication. Weare all very excited about the year ahead. We believe we are extremelywell-positioned across the board for growth and improved financial performancein fiscal 2008 and beyond. ", "We will now take your questions. Operator. ", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from theline of Heath Terry with Credit Suisse. ", "Heath Terry - CreditSuisse", "Great. Could you give us a little more detail on thecomponents of getting the sports business to profitability? How much of it isadditional titles and the mix versus lower development costs or even lowerroyalty costs, in some cases?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, our profitability expectations are primarily based onexpanding our number of non-licensed sports titles, including Top Spin forTennis and Don King Presents Prizefighter, and we\u2019re also assuming higheraverage price points and a larger installed base of hardware. ", "Heath Terry - CreditSuisse", "Can you give us an idea of the number of sports SKUs thatyou\u2019ll have this year versus last year when you talk about that expanded titlelineup?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We haven\u2019t shared that information yet, Heath. ", "Heath Terry - CreditSuisse", "Okay, great. And then, to the extent that there is any kindof non-traditional revenues in the guidance for next year, whether it\u2019s in-gameadvertising, downloadable content, obviously you\u2019ve got the relationship or thedeal with Microsoft on the downloadable content for GTA. Can you give us anidea of what component you expect that to be next year?", "Benjamin Feder", "We\u2019re really not breaking that out but I think this is stilla time -- for most of what you just described, I think we\u2019ve said repeatedlywe\u2019re really interested in expanding that area of revenue, diversifying ourrevenue base, and we\u2019re pretty interested in building businesses like themicropayments business but it\u2019s very early days for that business. ", "Heath Terry - CreditSuisse", "Okay, great. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler withLehman Brothers. ", "Whitney Goldstein -Lehman Brothers", "", "Thanks for taking my question. This is Whitney Goldstein.I\u2019m just actually on the road right now. My question is regarding the hiring ofGary Dale. How do you expect your marketing efforts to change? Is he going tobe working on -- I know he\u2019s working with sales to focus on a specific genrelike the sports titles or it is overall strategy or is there anything we\u2019ll seedifferent in terms of your marketing efforts of that new hire? Thank you. ", "Benjamin Feder", "It\u2019s overall oversight on the sales organization but inaddition to that in terms of new revenue, we\u2019re highly focused on emergingmarkets, highly focused on Asia and certain markets in Latin America,specifically Brazil and Mexico. And he\u2019s going to be leading our efforts on thebusiness development front around the world. ", "Whitney Goldstein -Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay, great. Okay, thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst withHudson Square Research. ", "Daniel Ernst - HudsonSquare Research", "Thanks for taking the call. Two questions, if I might; one,just looking at the pipeline for fiscal \u201908, you commented about what you mighthave on the Wii front, given the success there. It looks like your Wii space isa little light relative to other titles you\u2019ve announced so far. ", "And then secondly on advertising, as you are approaching thelaunch of your big game for the year, can you talk about how your advertisingspend will ramp, your marketing spend, and how that might be different thistime around versus last, where you have a lot more opportunity for onlineadvertising -- that is not, you know, your advertising online and doingadvertising and demos and trailers on the consoles themselves that wasn\u2019treally available in the last gen. Thanks. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Thanks, Daniel. With respect to your first question on thepipeline, we have seven titles on Wii. We\u2019re pretty proud of that, actually.We\u2019ve turned this company from a non-Nintendo shop into a shop that\u2019s focusedas much on Nintendo as it is on every other platform. Just to name a few, Bullyis coming out on Wii, Prizefighter will be coming out on Wii. And actually, wethink prizefighter as a boxing game is actually a pretty compelling game on theWii. ", "And it\u2019s not just the Wii. We are also focused on the DS. Aswe said, Carnival Games will be coming out on DS and so we are pretty excitedabout that and as I said, we have a pretty good track record on the Wii and wetend to exploit that. ", "So I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as light. I would characterizeit as perfectly appropriate. ", "With respect to launch and the advertising budgets, youknow, it\u2019s really kind of case by case. Some titles will be more appropriatefor traditional marketing and some for traditional advertising channels andother products are more appropriate for online and alternative advertisingchannels. It\u2019s really kind of case by case. ", "I will tell you that both Strauss and I review the marketingplans of each and every title with a great deal of detail. And by the way, wedon\u2019t always -- I wouldn\u2019t say we don\u2019t always agree but there is a healthydebate on where the advertising dollars should be spent and there is a prettyrobust conversation that goes on internally about that. ", "Daniel Ernst - HudsonSquare Research", "Sure, but if you look at GTA in particular, which obviouslyhas some notoriety around it and it maybe doesn\u2019t need a whole lot ofadvertising. Maybe talk strictly about the plans -- not specifically but ingeneral terms about how advertising and marketing for that launch will bedifferent than this time last time. ", "Benjamin Feder", "If you are asking whether we should reduce our marketingexpense for Grand Theft Auto, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the best thing for thefranchise. I don\u2019t think anybody internally believes that\u2019s the best thing forthe franchise. In fact, we\u2019ll be spending a healthy marketing budget to promotethat and promote it on a worldwide basis. ", "And by the way, I think the trend is heading there too. Youjust need to look at Halo 3\u2019s budget, for example, and that tells you the wholestory. So I don\u2019t think this is a game where we are just going to try to getout and take advantage of the existing brand recognition and just try to launcha game on the cheat. We\u2019re going to launch a game in the way that\u2019s appropriatefor the franchise. ", "Daniel Ernst - HudsonSquare Research", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey withJanco Partners. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "Thank you. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Curious on GTA IV;do you have any sense of how the sales of that game are going to spread acrossyour three quarters of your fiscal \u201908 period? I\u2019m guessing most will beup-front but any color on that would be great. ", "And then for your GTA, your last GTA IV trailer, do you haveany data points in terms of the amount of hits the trailer got in the firstweek or so that you could share with us?", "And then the last question, taking a look at your sportsbusiness, I think Blue Castle did code for your biggest game. Do you plan toextend that license across other games like you did in fiscal \u201907, like TheBigs or MLB Power Pros?", "Benjamin Feder", "I\u2019m not sure -- well, let\u2019s take the first couple. In termsof the spread of sales, that\u2019s not really something we discuss and if historyis any guide, and obviously we have very high expectations for Grand Theft AutoIV, we certainly expect this title to keep selling for some time but I don\u2019tthink it\u2019s appropriate to talk about how we spread out the expectations exceptthat they are meaningful. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "I would say that we\u2019ve said in the past, I think it\u2019s stilltrue that when it was scheduled for release in October, that was probably ashorter window to spread over the sales because you hit the Christmas season,so our view remains unchanged from that, which is to say that you would expectto sell the same number of units but over a longer period of time than we wouldhave seen had it shipped in October. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "Okay, and then on the trailer that you just put out, do youhave any data points for us in terms of -- ", "Benjamin Feder", "Our sense is that it\u2019s been very popularly received but wedon\u2019t specifically share exact data points. But if you haven\u2019t seen it, it\u2019sworth -- I\u2019ll give you the plug; it\u2019s really fantastic. It\u2019s certainly worthwatching. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "No, I\u2019ve seen it about 10 times. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Good. Then you know. That would be about 20 minutes of yourtime. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "And then I think Blue Castle -- ", "Benjamin Feder", "I didn\u2019t follow the question on Blue Castle. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "You\u2019ve extended the MLB brand across different titles, themain one, of course, then Bigs and Power Pros. And looking at the rest of yourtitles through your fiscal \u201908 period, I don\u2019t see The Bigs or MLB Power Pros.I\u2019m just curious if your philosophy has changed there or are those -- are theygoing to be there?", "Benjamin Feder", "We have a commitment in our baseball genre. We are kind ofcommitted to send it over a number of SKUs. You could expect to see that onsome of our other sports titles as well. I think generally the philosophy ofTake-Two is to extend our brands over a number of different platforms asopposed to being narrow in our platform focus. But certainly in baseball, weare highly committed to extending the brands to multiple platforms. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "Okay, and then the last one, on Midnight Club, is this agame that you guys can come out with annually? I mean, you\u2019ve kind of skippedit but it seems like if you look at some of your competitors raising games,they have the ability to come out every year. And clearly this is a verypopular game and I think it would do well if you could do it annually. Issomething in the works or --", "Benjamin Feder", "You know, I think our view is a little bit different. Firstof all, we are driven first and foremost by making the best games in thebusiness and you can\u2019t do that on a clockwork type schedule. ", "I think the second thing is even if we had the ability to doa triple A title annually, the question is how do you optimize the consumers\u2019desire for a franchise title, the needed development time, and the concern thatif you come out too frequently, you run the risk of burning the franchise out.And I think Rockstar particularly has done a terrific job of managing that. Inother words, optimizing the required development time against optimizingconsumers\u2019 expectations, hopes, and interest. ", "And what\u2019s -- I suppose you could argue that we leavesomething on the table by not putting stuff out, like stamping out cookies butthat\u2019s just not how we operate around here. Every product is seen as somethingthat\u2019s terribly important to us, it\u2019s key to the company and frankly we lookat, and this creates a lot of pressure on our very talented people, we look ateach game as a standalone new product that has to be better than the last, andthat takes time. And if we can deliver that to the consumers, it\u2019s somethingworth waiting for and I actually think it enhances the value of the franchiseover time and extends its life. ", "Of course, what that means is and we said this is part ofour strategy, is we want to build up further our already leading portfolio ofowned intellectual property so that while you can\u2019t count on a release everyquarter, and again we\u2019re driven by the quality of products, not our quarterlyfinancial desires, what we\u2019d really like to do is have a release schedule thatgets more and more robust and more and more predictable every year. But the wayto do that isn\u2019t burning out a franchise that consumers love. The way to dothat is develop more great franchises.", "And frankly, we\u2019ve shown -- not to overstate the case, but Ithink Bioshock puts a fine point on that. That looks to be another strongrepeatable franchise. We certainly feel that way about it. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "There isn\u2019t a piece of us, I mean, your question, Mike andthe earlier question I think from Daniel, there isn\u2019t a piece of us that wantsto harvest any of these franchises and sort of say okay, let\u2019s turn off themarketing and let\u2019s just harvest what we can in terms of cash. It\u2019s not what weare about. It\u2019s not what the company\u2019s about. We\u2019re building up IP and we\u2019rebuilding up franchises. ", "Benjamin Feder", "And doing it based on quality and meeting consumers\u2019desires. We\u2019re trying to delight our consumers. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "Thank you very much, guys. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill withCitigroup.", "Brent Thill -Citigroup", "Thanks. Can you give us a sense of what percent of therevenue today is owned IP and where you would like to see that over the nextyear?", "Benjamin Feder", "I think the answer is about two-thirds internal and aboutone-third external and that roughly tracks, but not entirely tracks, ownedintellectual property. But it\u2019s certainly our strategy to own our brands. ", "Brent Thill -Citigroup", "Okay. And just a follow-up on Grand Theft Auto, can you justgive us your conviction level for the Q2 ship and have you thought aboutputting GTA on the Wii?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We wouldn\u2019t say it if we weren\u2019t convicted. ", "Benjamin Feder", "We have a high conviction level and right now I think, nodisrespect meant for the platform, but I think there are other titles that arebetter suited to the Wii than Grand Theft Auto IV. ", "Brent Thill -Citigroup", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter withUBS.", "Benjamin Schachter -UBS", "A few follow-ups on the marketing; anecdotally, it seemsthat there\u2019s more TV coming out for Bioshock recently. I was wondering if therewas anything you learned from that that will relate to GTA marketing?", "And then also, do you expect to get any significant or howsignificant marketing support from the hardware companies for GTA?", "And then finally on GTA, do you expect to have a higherpriced collection edition of GTA? And if so, what percentage of sales couldthat represent? Thanks. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "I think each product stands alone and you try to optimizethe marketing, as Ben said. This is an interest that\u2019s near and dear to ourhearts so we could wax eloquent, but in a nutshell we went back on televisionwith Bioshock because we thought there was a terrific opportunity for theholiday season and we have reason to believe that will be successful. ", "I\u2019m not going to tip our hands on the GTA IV marketing plan.As Ben said, it\u2019s a very robust plan. We are taking nothing for granted. Thefact that you have awareness, you still have to do it in a way that isconsistent with what consumers expect and the image of the brand and I believewe will come out with a very, very creative plan. But it doesn\u2019t -- it won\u2019ttrack the Bioshock plan. Each one stands alone. ", "In terms of hardware support, we have a close relationshipwith the hardware licensors, very close relationship. We know they areobviously interested in building up their platform\u2019s success level but we don\u2019ttalk specifically about our confidential discussions and agreements with them. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Two more points -- you\u2019ve got to bear in mind that Bioshockwas released in a window that was just prior to Halo 3, and so it\u2019s not likewe\u2019ve increased our marketing. That was always the plan to have the one-twopunch, give Halo 3 the air that it needed and oxygen that it needed and thenhave a second punch. That was always the plan. The other thing that you\u2019ve gotto consider is that Grand Theft Auto is a title that is in a category on itsown. When it ships and is supported by television, it\u2019s going to have a prettywide berth. The industry will give it a pretty wide berth. Bioshock was new IPthat needed to start with a core audience and then we extended beyond the coreaudience. ", "So they are very, very different titles as Strauss said. Ofcourse we are always learning. I think one of the things we\u2019ve subscribed to dosince we arrived at the company is to increase learning at the company to makesure that what we do in one title, we take best practices and apply it to othertitles and we continue to do that. ", "But these actually are two different animals. ", "Benjamin Schachter -UBS", "And will there be any type of higher priced collector\u2019sedition that could make up a meaningful percentage of sales?", "Benjamin Feder", "We don\u2019t have a percentage of sales. In any event, it wouldjust be a budget number, not an actual number by definition, but there will bea special edition. ", "Benjamin Schachter -UBS", "And the last question, given Carnival\u2019s success, does thatchange your Wii development strategy?", "Benjamin Feder", "We are -- it doesn\u2019t change the Wii development strategybecause we\u2019ve always been committed to the Wii. Since it arrived, we werecommitted to the Wii and to the DS. Does it change our view of what a familyoriented title can be, of that genre and that production value? Absolutely. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "In a very positive way. ", "Benjamin Schachter -UBS", "Great. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz withCowen & Company. Mr. Creutz, your line is open. Our next question comesfrom the line of John Taylor with Arcadia Investment Corporation.", "John Taylor - ArcadiaInvestment Corporation", "I gather you would have given us a date if you wanted towhen GTA is going to ship. I wonder, have you picked a firm date or are youbeing vague with everybody on that?", "Benjamin Feder", "We\u2019re really not being vague. We\u2019re just confirming secondfiscal quarter. I understand that\u2019s a three-month time span but we\u2019ll announcethe date when we\u2019re ready to announce the date and tailor our marketing plansaccordingly. ", "We\u2019re really not intending to be vague. We\u2019ll announce thedate when we have the date. ", "John Taylor - ArcadiaInvestment Corporation", "Okay, so does that imply you don\u2019t have a specific date eveninternally at this point?", "Benjamin Feder", "Yeah, I\u2019ve probably pretty much said everything I\u2019m going tosay on it. ", "John Taylor - ArcadiaInvestment Corporation", "All right. And then on the -- I wonder if you could talk alittle bit about Jack of All Games. What are you guys seeing in terms of dealsor potential deals that might become available from publisher over-builds,whatever, going into the first quarter? Can you characterize that opportunityfor us?", "Benjamin Feder", "It\u2019s a great question. I think we all are eagerly awaitingto see what happens post-Christmas. There is I think probably some over-buildin certain areas, certain genres, certain platforms. I think it\u2019s a terrificopportunity for Jack and we\u2019ll be pursuing that at the right time. It\u2019s alittle too early to tell but that\u2019s actually something that Jack excels at andwe\u2019ll be looking at that very, very carefully. It\u2019s a great question. ", "John Taylor - ArcadiaInvestment Corporation", "Okay. All right and then Lainie, do you happen to know whatthe inventory distribution is between Jack and the publishing side?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Sure. It\u2019s about 70% distribution and publishing is 30%.That\u2019s the mix. ", "John Taylor - ArcadiaInvestment Corporation", "Okay, good. And the last question, if you add together youramortization of development costs in the P&L in fiscal \u201907 and add to thatR&D and then the increase in capital development costs, you come up withwhatever it is, a couple hundred million dollars. I wonder, can you give us --can you characterize kind of what you expect the total cash spend on productdevelopment to look like if you use all those accounts by the end of the year,by the end of the next fiscal?", "Lainie Goldstein", "I don\u2019t have that in front of me and we really have nevershared that before, so I can\u2019t give you that information right now. ", "John Taylor - ArcadiaInvestment Corporation", "Directionally -- flat, up, down?", "Lainie Goldstein", "I don\u2019t have it. Sorry. ", "John Taylor - ArcadiaInvestment Corporation", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz withCowen & Company.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen& Company", "Hi. Sorry about that. We had a little phone glitch. It lookslike GTA IV has been given a rating in Australia. I guess first, could youconfirm that? Second, what went into that process? What did you have to showthem and has it been approved for both the 360 and the PS3 platforms? Thanks. ", "Benjamin Feder", "I can confirm that we received an M15-plus rating inAustralia. It\u2019s the same rating, by the way, that we received on Grand TheftAuto: San Andreas. Typically we will submit the rating to Australia earlierthan other territories and the rating -- there\u2019s a rating package that goes,that typically is submitted to the ratings board in every individual countryand it includes a bunch of documentation, a reel of the game, all the stuffyou\u2019d expect in the ratings. There\u2019s nothing special required on that basis.And the rating is fully what we had expected and we are very pleased to see it.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen& Company", "I guess my question, did they have to see a final build ofthe game to give it a rating or was it just a selection of stuff from the game?", "Benjamin Feder", "They have to see a substantially complete game. That\u2019s notto say that we can\u2019t alter it once we receive the rating. We can continue topolish the game. ", "Doug Creutz - Cowen& Company", "Okay. Is an ESRB rating a gaiting item for you guys todetermine a final ship date?", "Benjamin Feder", "An ESRB rating is a gaiting item for every game to get thefinal ship date. ", "Doug Creutz - Cowen& Company", "Well, I guess to announce the final ship date. Let meclarify that. ", "Benjamin Feder", "I don\u2019t think -- no, I don\u2019t think we would wait for theESRB to announce a final ship date, no. ", "Doug Creutz - Cowen& Company", "Okay. Thank you.

A few questions; could you let us knowwhat\u2019s in your plan for next year in terms of stock-based comp and one-time items,just to reconcile the GAAP and non-GAAP? And second question, any update onpotential realignment of comp plans at Rockstar studios? And the thirdquestion, can you help us with a tax rate on \u201908 and \u201909?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, we have for the full year for 2008, we have $0.45 ofstock compensation and $0.07 of unusual business reorganization charges andlegal matter expenses. That\u2019s the first part of your question, Tony. What\u2019s thesecond part?", "Anthony Gikas - PiperJaffray", "The second part is any update on the potential realignmentof comp plans at Rockstar and then tax rate for \u201908 and \u201909. ", "Benjamin Feder", "We don\u2019t have any updates about our internal comp plans andas you know, anything material, we take great pains to announce as soon as wehave news. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "And for the tax rate, we announced on our call, the Q3 call,I think a dollar amount specific to fiscal year 2008 for taxes and that numberhas not changed, and it\u2019s for our international business, where we are ataxpayer. But in the U.S., we\u2019ll continue to not be a taxpayer and we will alsoin 2009 anticipate not being a taxpayer in that year as well. ", "Anthony Gikas - PiperJaffray", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Edward Williamswith BMO Capital Markets.", "Edward Williams - BMOCapital Markets", "Just a couple of quick questions for you; first of all, withregard to your R&D headcount, can you give us an idea as to where you endedthe fiscal year and how you expect that headcount to change throughout 2008? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "We have currently 1,200 as of the end of 2007. I don\u2019t havea 2008 number in front of me. We can get that number and we can get back to youon that. ", "Benjamin Feder", "I think you can safely assume it\u2019s going to grow. We aregrowing our business. ", "Edward Williams - BMOCapital Markets", "Okay, and along those lines, how significant do you think 2KMarin should be? ", "Benjamin Feder", "I think we have great hopes for it. It remains to be seen.It\u2019s obviously a key part of the strategy. It\u2019s going to work on its ownintellectual property and work with other studios around the world. We thinkit\u2019s a very positive step, particularly because we\u2019ve moved senior managementout to Novato. ", "Edward Williams - BMOCapital Markets", "And then looking at your \u201908 release schedule, can you giveus any granularity as to which quarters you expect some of these titles toship?", "Benjamin Feder", "Not yet. It\u2019s coming. ", "Edward Williams - BMOCapital Markets", "Okay, and this may be another one that\u2019s coming but can yougive us an idea as to when it may be coming -- the business model around theepisodic content for GTA IV, is that something that we could get some color onas soon as when GTA IV ships or as far away as when the episodic content isavailable?", "Benjamin Feder", "I think we -- you know, we\u2019re pleased that we beat guidancetwo quarters in a row and we take great pains not to particularly because ofhow this is all developed. We now take enormous pains to make sure that wedon\u2019t disclose forward-looking concepts before we\u2019re highly confident that weunderstand where things are going. ", "So we are not trying to be coy but if we are not going totell you something then we are also not going to tell you when we are going totell you. When we have the news, we\u2019ll share it with you. ", "Edward Williams - BMOCapital Markets", "Okay, so that\u2019s a TBD at this point. And then looking atyour international publishing in 2008, can you give us an idea as to whatpercentage of your publishing revenue you think will come from internationalmarkets?", "Benjamin Feder", "We don\u2019t disclose this in the 10-K generally but I would saywhen you look at international, it\u2019s important to break out the sports businessversus everything else, because sports is primarily a domestic business. ", "I don\u2019t have exact numbers here for you but I\u2019ll tell you,rule of thumb for non-sports business is about 50-50. ", "Edward Williams - BMOCapital Markets", "Okay, and then, looking at Jack\u2019s and the inventory that youhave there, what\u2019s your thought? Are you comfortable with the inventory levelsat this point or is that still a focus point in terms of reducing yourinventory?", "Benjamin Feder", "Well, at this point it\u2019s peak season, so it\u2019s appropriatefor where it is but I\u2019d like it to be lower because it\u2019s a big number. But itis appropriate for where we are in the season and we are -- we scrub inventoryon a quarterly basis. I\u2019m comfortable with what the number is and just as anoperational matter, we strive to get working capital down to as low a number aspossible. ", "Edward Williams - BMOCapital Markets", "All right, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Edward Urban withBear Stearns.", "Edward Urban - BearStearns", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I waswondering, your fiscal \u201908 EPS or gross margin guidance, rather, is slightlyhigher than we saw following the prior GTA release. What specifically gives youthe confidence in being able to achieve that margin?", "And then secondly, recently you mentioned some Nintendoproduction issues related to Carnival Games. Can you elaborate a bit on theexact issue you are facing there and do you have any visibility at this time intowhen supply will improve there?", "Benjamin Feder", "I think our margin is simply a broader mix of internallydeveloped titles. We own the intellectual property and that extends beyond GTAIV. And in terms of availability of product for the Wii, look, you know, thisis a high-class problem. When you have a hit title, sometimes it\u2019s hard to keepit in stock and Nintendo is a great partner and we are working together to tryto get that product to consumers. The good news is consumers remain very, veryinterested and we see it\u2019s really an evergreen product. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "By the way, we\u2019ve already begun to see supply ease up. ", "Edward Urban - BearStearns", "Okay, and in terms of the gross margin, you mentionedinternally developed product and it seems like Rockstar as a percentage ofsales will be comparable for this release in the fiscal year compared with theprior release, of the other divisions, were you expecting significantcontribution or what releases are you pointing to outside of Rockstar thatwould drive that margin?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Our distribution business margin is up as well as the 2KGames, the sports business as well has a pretty strong margin and in the lastrelease, our sports business wasn\u2019t as strong at that time. ", "Edward Urban - BearStearns", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Evan Wilson withPacific Crest.", "Evan Wilson - PacificCrest Securities", "A couple of questions for you; first, I\u2019d like to follow-upagain on Carnival Games. Give us, if possible, could you give us a feeling of a-- you know, a basis of that 500,000 units that you said had sold so far, whatyou think the potential for the game would have been if there were no supplyconstraints? And also, what the sales cycle looks for that game now that it\u2019sbeen out for a while and there\u2019s some other stuff out there? Do you think thatyou have still a big opportunity to continue to sell it through the Januaryquarter? ", "And then on the GTA release, if you could be a little bitmore specific around the PS3 and 360 platform. We\u2019ve seen several otherpublishers decide to do a split release. I know that\u2019s not ideal. Is itsomething you\u2019d consider, even if it would keep both releases inside the fiscalQ2?", "Benjamin Feder", "First question on Carnival Games, it\u2019s almost an impossiblequestion to answer because you don\u2019t know -- if a consumer wants a game, it\u2019snot available, you just have no idea whether that game is -- you know, whetherthey would have purchased that game or not. It\u2019s an impossible question toanswer. ", "Do we think it has legs after January? Absolutely. It\u2019sprecisely that title and that kind of title. We think it\u2019s an evergreen titleand we\u2019re encouraged by the fact that Wiis will continue to ship throughChristmas and beyond. We\u2019re encouraged by the rain check program that they justannounced with Gamestop. We think as the installed base grows, it\u2019s only goingto be good news for Carnival Games and we think it\u2019s a must have title, so weare pretty excited about it and we think it\u2019s going to extend well beyond thisChristmas. ", "And as I said, we\u2019ll be extending that to other platforms.Yes, it\u2019s a growing franchise with growing characters and we plan to exploitthose as well. ", "With respect to Grand Theft Auto, we\u2019re committed tosimultaneously ship PS3 and 360. ", "Evan Wilson - PacificCrest Securities", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam [Knowle] withCowen & Company. ", "Adam Knowle - Cowen& Company", "Thanks, guys. All my questions have already been answered. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey withJanco Partners. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "Follow-ups, I was curious if you could update us on yourcost cutting. I think you were looking for $25 million run-rate by the end ofyour \u201908 period, with a potential for upside. Can you give us some clarity onthat?", "Benjamin Feder", "That\u2019s exactly still accurate. We expect to realize the $25million largely in its entirety by the end of \u201908 and we think there\u2019s furthercost reduction to be done, although to be clear, it will not be headcountdriven. It will be driven from non-headcount related costs, so really drivenfrom getting the core business more efficient but we don\u2019t expect to do thisthrough headcount reductions. We are really happy with the team and thestructure and we are in growth mode. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Just a little bit of detail, I think we -- we think we\u2019vegot about $10 million in 2007, the rest coming in 2008. It doesn\u2019t includesavings from legal costs and we expect those legal costs to go downdramatically as we continue to settle out some of the outstanding litigation.So I would say $25 million is a floor. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "Okay, and the legal costs, that was -- was that an extrathree to four per quarter, or -- ", "Benjamin Feder", "In 2007, we spent $17 million in outstanding litigation and weexpect that number to be reduced dramatically. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "Okay, great and then the margin on Borderlands, and this anexternally developed property, right? So it\u2019s going to be a little bit lower?", "Benjamin Feder", "Correct. ", "Mike Hickey - JancoPartners", "Okay. And I\u2019m sure, Strauss, you would have pushed a pressrelease on this but SEC and DA investigation, any updates there or any [inaudible]you can give us?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We don\u2019t have anything more to announce. We are doing thebest we can to get those issues wrapped up as expeditiously as possible. As youknow, we can put our best forward and we still have to address the internalconcerns of those agencies.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Cindy Buckwalter, Executive Vice President for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you, Ms. Buckwalter. You may begin. ", "Cindy Buckwalter", "Thank you. Welcome and thank you all for joining us for today\u2019s call. ", "Before we begin, I would first like to quickly review our Safe Harbor statement by reminding everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of and assumptions made by our management and information currently available to us at this time. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors, including the risks related to Electronic Arts\u2019 unsolicited acquisition proposal. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007, and our 10-Q for the first quarter ended January 31, 2008, which we are filing today. These filings may be obtained from our website at www.taketwogames.com or by contacting the SEC. ", "Today\u2019s one-hour call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Chairman of Take-Two; Ben Feder, our CEO; and Lainie Goldstein, our CFO. We are also joined by Seth Krauss, our Chief Legal Counsel. The entire team will be available to answer questions you may have during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Cindy and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before we review Take-Two's results for the first quarter, I want to take this opportunity to offer our perspective on Electronic Arts\u2019 unsolicited $26 per share proposal to acquire our company. While we have no new information today beyond our prior public statements and filings, we feel it\u2019s important to reiterate the position of our board of directors. That position simply is that EA\u2019s proposal undervalued the company and wasn\u2019t in the best interests of Take-Two's stockholders. In addition, while our board expressed a willingness to discuss the matter with Electronic Arts after the release of Grand Theft Auto IV in April, they refused. ", "To be more specific, the EA proposal failed to value fully Take-Two's extensive portfolio of top-selling brands and our extraordinary creative and [human assets]. It ignored the tremendous operational progress we\u2019ve made in the past year and our solid plan going forward. It was substantially lower than the values according comparable companies and creative assets by Electronic Arts and by the market as a whole. And it failed to compensate Take-Two shareholders for any of the synergies EA would receive from the business combination. ", "I think it\u2019s worthwhile to spend a moment considering these points since they bear on our discussion today. Any review of Take-Two's value has to start with our interactive entertainment franchises and the extraordinary creative teams who bring them to consumers and delight consumers. We have one of the highest quality product lines in the industry according to Metacritic rankings. Our franchises are some of the most popular, durable, and valuable brands in the business and we think those brands will only grow in value as the current console cycle reaches its full potential over the coming years. ", "A chief source of value is our Grand Theft Auto franchise. It sold over 66 million units to date. It\u2019s not only Take-Two's biggest hit -- it\u2019s the industry\u2019s biggest hit. The release of Grand Theft Auto IV is now about seven weeks away and anticipation is running high, both in terms of the game play experience that\u2019s expected and the revenue and profit potential. We are highly confident that Grand Theft Auto IV will exceed the expectations of even the game\u2019s most devoted fans and that it will set a new milestone for this incredibly valuable franchise. ", "In addition to Grand Theft Auto, our uniquely valuable franchises include over 20 other brands that have sold over a million units each. More than half of these are internally owned and developed and we believe our proprietary intellectual property is among the best in the industry. To cite just a few examples among our established franchises, Midnight Club has sold over 11.5 million units; Max Payne, over 7 million units; Civilization, over 8 million units; Mafia, over 2 million units. And the initial versions, the first releases of our newer franchises have also performed extremely well. This is just the beginning for Bioshock, which has sold over 2 million units; Red Dead, Manhunt, and Bully, over 1.5 million units, and Carnival Games, over a million units and selling well. ", "And our sports franchises have been highly successful and we are really proud of how sports is doing -- the NBA 2KA franchise, nearly 6 million units; the MLB 2K franchise approaching 5 million units. ", "As long-term followers of Take-Two know, we began a significant revitalization effort early in 2007 and even though it\u2019s just a short time later, we\u2019ve already begun to see significant and positive impact on our effectiveness and our productivity. To highlight just a few of the areas in which we\u2019ve made enormous strides: we implemented a more streamlined and efficient operating structure, including $25 million in annual cost efficiencies. You are seeing the benefit of those now. ", "We instituted a disciplined product investment review process. We restructured our international operations to create a more efficient and responsive global sales and marketing organization. ", "We consolidated 2K Games and 2K Sports on the West Coast to increase the efficiency and better support the growth of these labels. We sold the non-core Joytech business. We secured a $140 million line of credit in a challenging lending market and we\u2019ve made significant progress in resolving legacy legal and regulatory issues. ", "The fact is Take-Two is a profoundly different and stronger company today as a result of these initiatives. We are poised to reap the benefits of these actions in the near and long-term. ", "To summarize, the entire team at Take-Two is working hard to enhance the value of our business through our extraordinary creative talent, our irreplaceable intellectual property, and our ongoing operational improvements. Our board recognizes its responsibility to manage the company in accordance with the best interest of our stockholders and I would like to emphasize that we\u2019ll continue to do so. ", "And now Ben will review some of the highlights for the first quarter and we\u2019ll provide our outlook for the remainder of 2008 and some insight into 2009. Ben. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Thanks, Strauss. We\u2019re extremely pleased that once again we outperformed our expectations. Net revenue was over $240 million, beating the upper end of our guidance. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss per share was negative $0.41 and exceeded the most optimistic end of our range by $0.09. ", "As a result of the positive first quarter developments and our strong pipeline, we are raising our fiscal 2008 guidance today. Lainie will detail our guidance and review our first quarter performance later in the call but I\u2019d like to make a few observations. ", "With no major new release during Q1, the majority of our revenue came from our strong catalog. We benefited from the sales of three internally owned and internally developed titles, namely Bioshock, Carnival Games, and Manhunt 2. ", "Grand Theft Auto was also a significant contributor, both from catalog sales of various GTA titles and from the release in Japan of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories on PS2 and PSP. ", "NBA 2K8 was also a key contributor in the quarter and significantly outranked the competing product and outsold the competition on next gen platforms. The performance of these catalog titles underscores the significant value of our internally owned IP, which we believe is among the strongest in the business, and our ability to leverage that IP through sequels and product extensions. ", "Our distribution business rose in Q1, led by strong demand for next-gen software and hardware. From a cost standpoint, we realized meaningfully lower G&A expenses in Q1 on a non-GAAP basis compared to both Q1 last year and our fourth quarter. This reflects the continuing positive impact of our revitalization and our cost reduction initiatives. ", "Our pipeline for fiscal 2008 clearly demonstrates the strength of our IP and the diversity of our product range. For example, last month 2KPlay, our new label targeting the family game segment, released Go Diego Do: Safari Rescue for Wii and PS2, and Dora the Explorer: Dora Saves the Mermaids, also on PS2. ", "Last week, Rockstar shipped Bully: Scholarship Edition for Xbox 360 and Wii. The title has been very well-received by the game press, and 2KSports released Major League Baseball 2K8 on multiple platforms simultaneously. ", "For the remainder of fiscal 2008, our lineup is one of the strongest in the industry. It provides significant revenue visibility with a strong pipeline of proven brands, as well as several new titles. ", "In addition to the eagerly awaited Grand Theft Auto IV, our lineup includes Midnight Club: Los Angeles, episodic content for Grand Theft Auto on Xbox 360, Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: Revolution, Top Spin 3, Don King Presents Prizefighter, Carnival Games for DS, and as we announced today, Carnival Games: Mini-Golf exclusively for the Wii and our complete sports lineup. ", "The anticipation for Grand Theft Auto IV is rapidly building. The product previews reflect the phenomenal game play, huge open world environments, irreverent humor, and an incredible soundtrack that the series is known for. Unlike any previous Grand Theft Auto game, Grand Theft Auto will include a multi-player feature that promise to make this GTA experience the best and longest lasting that the series has ever known. ", "We\u2019ve received significant pre-orders from retailers that are better than expected and we expect a very strong worldwide launch on April 29th. ", "We are also excited about the customer and retailer feedback for Midnight Club: Los Angeles, which we are shipping in Q4. We recently returned from the Destination PlayStation industry event and the response from retail was fantastic. ", "Consistent with our strategy, we have continued to strengthen our portfolio of brands and acquired the Illusion Softworks studio in January. Illusion is based in the Czech Republic and has been renamed 2K Czech. They are the creator and owner of several hit franchises, including Mafia, which sold over 2 million units in its first installment, as well as Hidden and Dangerous and Vietcong. 2K Czech is working on Mafia 2 for fiscal 2009 and while we previously published this title on a third-party basis, we now will have the advantage of owning this IP. ", "The Illusion acquisition brings us further scale not only in terms of valuable properties but also extends our global pool of industry-leading creative talent to a new region. This studio has approximately 160 developers. ", "Our fiscal 2009 pipeline is shaping up nicely and will be another strong year for Take-Two. In addition to Mafia 2, we have additional episodic content for Grand Theft Auto for Xbox 360, sequels to some of Rockstar\u2019s Triple A titles, our complete sports lineup, and several new brands. ", "We are very pleased to announce today Bioshock 2, the sequel to our wholly-owned and internally developed from 2K that has sold over 2 million units since its launch in August. The title is being developed by 2K Marin and is planned for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. ", "We also announced today that we will be releasing Borderlands in fiscal 2009. We think the timing of this highly anticipated game provides a better balance among our triple A titles and further strengthens our fiscal 2009 release schedule. ", "I\u2019ll conclude by reiterating the points made earlier regarding the value of our creative portfolio, global talent base and increasingly efficient organizational structure. Take-Two is strongly positioned to benefit from the positive trends in our industry. We\u2019ll continue to work to transform our strength into increasing value from shareholders and we are intently focused on making Take-Two the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient company in our industry. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lainie. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Ben and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll be covering several topics today. First, a review of first quarter results; second, our outlook for fiscal 2008; and third, our guidance for the second quarter. ", "Let\u2019s look at our Q1 results. Net revenue was $240 million compared with $277 million a year ago. Non-GAAP net loss was $30.3 million compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $10.3 million last year, with a loss per share of $0.41 compared to a loss of $0.14 last year. Please see today\u2019s press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers. ", "We are pleased that we exceeded our guidance for a third quarter in a row. Sales of Carnival Games surpassed our expectations, as did our catalog sales. Jack of All Games top line performance was also better than expected. ", "Our GAAP results for the first quarter were a net loss of approximately $38 million, or $0.52 per share, compared with a loss of $21.5 million, or $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2007. Our GAAP results included $6.1 million in stock-based compensation expense and a total of $1.7 million in business reorganization costs and expenses related to unusual legal matters. ", "As expected, our decline in revenue year over year was due to a decrease in publishing sales, as we had fewer new releases this quarter compared to the prior year. Our leading titles in Q1 were Carnival Games, NBA 2K8, Bioshock, and GTA catalog titles. Our sports business was once again a strong contributor to revenue, representing about 26% of our publishing revenue. Jack of All Games business also grew, led by strong next-gen hardware and software sales. ", "In looking at our consolidated results, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 22.9% compared to 26.6% last year. The decrease in our gross margin compared to last year is primarily due to our revenue mix. Distribution was a greater percentage of revenue compared to Q1 of last year and the significant percentage of our publishing revenue was comprised of catalog titles instead of major new releases. ", "In addition, gross margins were slightly lower than we expected as a result of approximately $5.9 million of accelerate amortization of capitalized software and licenses due to reduced sales expectations for certain titles. ", "Our split between North America and international revenue was 84% to 16% in Q1. Our sports and distribution businesses skew these numbers relative to our peers because these businesses are primarily North American based. ", "If you back out sports and distribution and look at this number for the last 12 months, our North America/international revenue split was about 60% to 40% compared to about 56% to 44% for the same 12 month period a year ago. ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately $80.5 million, down from last year\u2019s first quarter. G&A expenses accounted for the largest reduction year over year, mainly due to our cost savings initiatives. Sales and marketing expenses decreased as a result of lower advertising spend as we had fewer new releases. These reductions were somewhat offset by an increase in R&D expense resulting from continued investment in our studios and the acquisition of Illusion Softworks. ", "We\u2019re not showing any tax benefit on our losses. As we said on previous calls, due to our domestic cumulative losses for the past three years, we are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. We had a provision for taxes in the first quarter because we were a taxpayer in some of our international territories. ", "I\u2019d like to highlight a few areas of our performance. We have shipped over 1 million units of Carnival Games. U.S. sales of NBA 2K8 for PlayStation 3 and 360 combined have outsold sales of NBA Live for those platforms according to NPD, and our strong catalog sales further prove the significant value of our internally owned brands. ", "Moving on to our balance sheet, at the end of Q1 we had approximately $54 million in cash and $36 million of borrowings on our credit line. Based on our forecast cash needs, we expect to draw down on the line further in Q2 and then we will begin to generate cash in Q3 following the release of Grand Theft Auto IV. ", "Our accounts receivable reserve was about $53 million at the end of the quarter, which represented approximately 46% of gross receivables. Inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately $82 million, which is comparable to Q1 of last year. The increase in our software development costs and licenses is primarily related to the key titles planned or release over the next 12 to 18 months. This includes Grand Theft Auto IV, Midnight Club: Los Angeles, Civilization: Revolution, and Borderlands. We currently have approximately 35 titles in various stages of development.  ", "Now to our outlook for fiscal 2008; we are raising the guidance that we previously provided in December. We now expect $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion in revenue and $1.35 to $1.55 per share on a non-GAAP basis. The key assumptions underlying that guidance were provided in our Q3 conference call on September 10th and those assumptions are still valid today with one exception; R&D expense will increase by approximately 30% over the prior year compared to our previous estimate of a 25% increase, primarily due to the acquisition of Illusion Softworks and the continued investment in our development studios. ", "The key factors in raising our fiscal 2008 guidance are our Q1 results exceeded our forecasts and the preorders and initial gamer feedback on Grand Theft Auto IV has been even better than expected. ", "These factors were slightly offset by our decision to release Borderlands next year to further strengthen our release schedule for fiscal 2008. Also, Midnight Club: Los Angeles was initially planned for release this spring. We moved the title to the fourth quarter to leverage the retail strength leading into the key holiday selling season and in order to provide some distance from the release of Grand Theft Auto IV. ", "We are issuing guidance today for the 2008 second quarter. We expect non-GAAP income per share in the range of $1 to $1.10 on $450 million to $500 million in revenue. This excludes stock-based compensation expense of $0.16 per share and reorganization costs and expenses related to unusual legal matters of $0.04 per share. ", "Let me discuss some additional data points on our Q2 outlook. We expect our revenue mix to be heavily weighted towards publishing for the release of Grand Theft Auto IV. This should result in increased gross profit margins of about 38% compared to 25% in Q2 of last year. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margins of approximately 35%. ", "We expect overall operating expenses to trend up in Q2 as compared to Q1, primarily driven by higher marketing spend for the release of Grand Theft Auto IV. In addition, G&A expense increased slightly from Q1 due to a foreign exchange gain in that quarter. ", "As for taxes, we expect to show a provision for taxes in Q2 for our international business only. ", "While we are not yet providing guidance for Q3 and Q4, I can provide some color on the expected timing of the remainder of our key fiscal 2008 titles that we have announced. For Q3, our key releases are: Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: Revolution, Top Spin 3, Don King Presents Prizefighter, and Carnival Games on the DS. ", "For Q4, our key releases are Midnight Club: Los Angeles, NBA 2K9, NHL 2K9, Carnival Games: Mini-Golf for the Wii, and Grand Theft Auto IV episodic content. ", "While it\u2019s early to give guidance for fiscal 2009, we\u2019d like to provide some color on the year. We are building a robust lineup that will include sequels to some of Rockstar\u2019s triple A brands and additional episodic content for Grand Theft Auto IV on Xbox 360. ", "2KGames key triple A titles will include Borderlands, Mafia 2, and Bioshock 2. 2KPlay will publish additional Nick Jr. titles under their agreement with Nickelodeon and rounding out our lineup will be our recurring sports business. We also expect to leverage the growing opportunities in emerging markets and will expand our downloadable content business as well as other ancillary revenue streams. ", "Fiscal 2009 will also reflect the first full year of our cost savings initiative. We are very optimistic about our future and the opportunities to further build shareholder value. ", "At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Lainie. I think you\u2019ll all understand our great confidence in the value being created at Take-Two by our exceptionally talented people, our industry leading franchises, and our successful revitalization efforts. We\u2019ll continue to manage the company for the benefit of our stockholders and we are highly optimistic about our future. We\u2019ll now take any questions you may have. Operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Credit Suisse. ", "Heath Terry - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you. I guess one just kind of housekeeping issue; the $5 million in accelerated depreciation, can you let us know what titles that was driven off of? And then Lainie, as you were talking about the key titles for \u201909, it was kind of noticeable that there were not Rockstar titles that were mentioned there. I guess if you guys could talk about how you plan on managing Rockstar\u2019s pipeline. We\u2019ve got two Rockstar titles coming out this year. Is that generally going to be the run-rate that we would expect? And then, now that GTA is done, if you can give us an idea of what your goal is in terms of the next iteration of that title. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Heath, the acceleration of the amortization, we don\u2019t share those specific titles when we do that but we do look at the projected sales of certain titles and that\u2019s how the acceleration happens by title, based on the projected future sales of those titles. ", "Benjamin Feder", "And Heath, apropos of the run-rate from Rockstar, I wouldn\u2019t draw that conclusion. We actually said that we would -- there\u2019d be at least one title coming out of Rockstar, one major triple A title coming out of Rockstar in 2009. ", "Heath Terry - Credit Suisse", "Okay, but that\u2019s the only one that we -- we should only expect one?", "Benjamin Feder", "That\u2019s the only one we\u2019re announcing today. ", "Heath Terry - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Benjamin Schachter with UBS Securities. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "I just want to go over a few things. One, now that the game is basically done, should we expect any meaningful differences in how it plays on PS3 versus Xbox 360? Also, I noticed that there\u2019s no football here. Is that -- are you out of the football business? And then I believe in one of the footnotes here, it talks about $2 million options going to ZelnickMedia. I was wondering if that had already been announced or where that\u2019s coming from. Thanks. ", "Benjamin Feder", "In terms of PS3 versus 360, the games will be identical with the exception of if there is a -- if there are differences on the platforms, you may see some of that. So for example, there is a slightly warmer color palette on the PS3 but beyond that, they\u2019ll be identical games. And then obviously the exclusive content on Xbox 360, the periodic content after the game is released. So that\u2019s Xbox 360. ", "Strauss, do you want to talk about the ZelnickMedia?", "Strauss Zelnick", "I\u2019m not sure I understand your question. There are no new option grants. You may be referring to our initial management agreement had roughly 2 million, just a hair over 2 million shares of options granted, divested over a period of time. That\u2019s about a year old. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "Okay, and then on football?", "Benjamin Feder", "On football, we\u2019re looking at it. We took it out of -- it\u2019s not on the schedule today but we\u2019re continuing to evaluate our options there. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Good evening. Thanks for taking the call. First question on the ongoing restructuring efforts; obviously you\u2019ve hit some of the low-hanging fruit and taking cost out of the business. I\u2019m just wondering if you think there\u2019s any additional headroom to remove costs from the operations and/or perhaps there are certain product sets or studios that are still a drag to P&L that you might be trying to break even, or perhaps just cut out all together, looking at the going forward operating model. And then another question on the potential lineup, anything to read out of the recent news of a Max Payne film production? Any insight into when that might be [a game again]? Thanks. ", "Benjamin Feder", "On the costs, just to be clear, we\u2019ve done our restructuring and we think we have a very lean and efficient organization. That said, we\u2019ve stated a willingness, an interest, and an ability to continue to drive efficiencies, and those would be driven really through third-party vendor costs and outside [costs]. This is a growth business. We think we have the best people in the business and the best intellectual property in the business and we\u2019ve stated a desire to grow our business, and so no, quite the opposite. There is no drag at the studios. We have the right studios. We now have them in the right places and if we could continue to hire the quality of people that we\u2019ve been able to attract and keep at this company, we\u2019d be very interested in hiring more of them. And I think you should expect to see opportunities like that in the future. ", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "And sports is near or approaching break-even?", "Benjamin Feder", "We are in the same position on sports we were before, which is to say we expected it to be a contributor this year and we feel good about the way sports is performing. ", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "So you think sports could be a contributor to earnings in this coming fiscal year, or this fiscal year now?", "Benjamin Feder", "We\u2019ve said that before and that\u2019s still the case. ", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Great. Max Payne?", "Benjamin Feder", "In terms of Max Payne, it\u2019s -- what\u2019s the word? We will sell no wine before it\u2019s time. It\u2019s a little early to comment on any particular title but we have a lot of interesting things going on. ", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Taylor with Arcadia Investment Corporation.", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "I\u2019ve got a couple of things as well. I wonder, on the balance sheet you\u2019ve got an income tax payable line of $28 million at the end of the quarter and it doesn\u2019t look like that was the case in October. Can you explain what that\u2019s related to?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Sure. That\u2019s a reclassification due to our adoption of FIN-48 during the quarter, so we were forced to reclassify our reserves for our uncertain tax positions and move it to a long-term, so it\u2019s out of our accrued expenses and it\u2019s in an income tax payable in the long-term asset section. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay. Is that subject to future performance or anything, or is that a real payable at this point?", "Lainie Goldstein", "No, that\u2019s a -- it\u2019s an income tax reserve. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay, and primarily related to international?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Not necessarily. It\u2019s overall reserves on the overall business. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay. But at the same time, you\u2019ve got some NOLs in the U.S. It\u2019s probably a pretty significant number right now?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes, that\u2019s true. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Can you give us what that is?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We don\u2019t share the specific NOL number but you\u2019ve seen our losses over the last couple of years, so it\u2019s significant. So we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re currently still not a U.S. taxpayer and we don\u2019t plan to be next year either. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Right. Okay and then, could you quantify the catalog? Was it like all of the sales? I don\u2019t remember if you had anything fresh in the first quarter.", "Lainie Goldstein", "We did. We had College Hoops ship during the first quarter and we had Dora the Explorer and Go Diego Go ship, and we also had the reorders from Bioshock and Carnival Games was a huge hit this quarter for us. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Right, so the catalog as a percent of published revenue was exactly what or pretty close to what? Percentage wise, maybe?", "Benjamin Feder", "About 44%.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Forty-four percent. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Of published?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Of publishing, yes. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay, great. And then, when you report your numbers in the second quarter, it looks like we\u2019re going to have some profitability so what\u2019s the full dilution count going to look like when that happens?", "Lainie Goldstein", "It\u2019s going to be about 75 million shares. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay, great. And then, there\u2019s been some press coverage of a severance plan being discussed or put into place in case of a change of control. I wonder if you could tell us how many people that\u2019s likely to cover and kind of what the annual cost of that group of salaries would total.", "Strauss Zelnick", "I\u2019ll answer the first part. It really only takes care of about 10% of the work force. The senior management was already covered by employment agreements in prior plans and the tier four employees were also covered by prior plans, so it represents about 10% of the work force and we\u2019re not discussing an actual number. ", "The plan, by the way, is relatively typical for the industry and relatively typical among our direct competitors. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Right, okay. And so I assume you qualify for that by length of service kind of thing? Is that triggered by length of service with the company or is it a salary -- I mean, what\u2019s the cut-off? How do you determine that 10%?", "Benjamin Feder", "I think what Strauss is referring to; the plan covers the entire company. There are different tiers that we\u2019ve outlined and the tier four tier, which is the lowest tier on the pyramid, is dependent on the number of years of service contributed to the company and your severance depends on that. ", "Senior executives, a lot of senior executives are already covered under contracts and I think that\u2019s what Strauss was referring to. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "I was referring to the incremental cost of the plan. Sorry about that. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay, great. ", "Benjamin Feder", "And then the overall cost obviously depends on, you know, in the event of a change of control, in the event certain things happen, it\u2019s hard to -- you know, you can model it out but there is no absolute number that I can give you today. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Yeah, okay. All right, and then -- let me see -- do you guys have a date or can you confirm that GTA IV has gone gold at this point?", "Benjamin Feder", "We are confirming our release date of April 29th. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "When do you expect -- or has it gone gold yet?", "Benjamin Feder", "We don\u2019t release that information. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay. All right and then my last question, actually I have two more housekeeping. One, could you give us the inventory breakdown between publishing and distribution at the end of the quarter?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Sure. The mix is 65% distribution and 35% publishing. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay, great. And then it looks like you are combining capitalized development and license cost. I wonder if you could break those out for us long-term, current and long-term?", "Benjamin Feder", "We don\u2019t have -- if you want, you can follow-up with Lainie afterwards. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay. Okay, good. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Janco Partners.", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Curious on 2K Marin. I thought that studio was created for original IP and why Bioshock is moving to 2K Marin? And what is Ken up to? Is he still attached to that name?", "And then if 2K Boss in Australia are not working on Bioshock 2, obviously we\u2019ve heard they are working on a different game. Is that something that we can model in the next year?", "Benjamin Feder", "You know, Ken is a terrific asset in the company and he\u2019s a brilliant game developer. We\u2019re really excited to have him. He\u2019s working on -- he will be working on Bioshock 2 and he will be working on the new IP. A lot of the work will be done at 2K Marin but that\u2019s not to say Ken is not involved. We think he\u2019s critical to Bioshock and he\u2019s critical to new IP in the company. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay, and then -- so then 2K Boss in Australia, they\u2019re working on one game then with a little bit of time spent on Bioshock 2, or -- ", "Benjamin Feder", "Yeah, they are working on another game. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay. And then you said that -- I think you said pre-orders for GTA IV were a little bit elevated relative to your original expectations. Is there a catalyst in your view for that?", "Benjamin Feder", "Look, it\u2019s getting a lot of publicity. I couldn\u2019t tell you what the catalyst was. We kind of see it -- we see it from preorders just on the numbers. Obviously the platforms are selling great. They seem to be resistant to any downward pressure in the market overall and I think consumers will probably tell you that they are nervous that there is not going to be enough when it comes out, but we are doing everything we can to get the game out. It\u2019s a great game. We think it\u2019s getting a lot of great publicity and we think it\u2019s just selling better than expected. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay, and when you guys modeled for your preorders, was that -- did you kind of index that against prior GTA releases and the preorders there or was that something different?", "Benjamin Feder", "We did a lot of modeling around here. We take it from a lot of different angles. Lainie and her team are fairly sophisticated when it comes to this stuff, so we -- there\u2019s obviously when you are in a hit-based business, there\u2019s always a range of outcomes that you expect but -- and you know, when you have early data, a lot of the ultimate data depends on what the early data is and so the early data is positive and as a result, we think the ultimate data will be positive. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay, and then last question on your release date for GTA IV, April 29th, not -- I can\u2019t think of any other videogame that would compete there but certainly on the cinema side, that\u2019s the start of the box office summer season and you have at least one tent pole coming out that weekend. Do you think that in any way kind of cramps your initial potential there or -- ", "Benjamin Feder", "Not in the least. I think this is a title that stands by itself. You know, when we first moved the title out from Christmas season, the feedback that we got from the marketplace and from consumers and retail channels was that this game stands on its own. It will withstand any competition either within the videogame business or outside the videogame business. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay. Thank you, guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company. ", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Company", "Thanks. Briefly, when you guys first came in a year ago, I think one of your priorities was trying to negotiate a new contract with Rockstar and obviously that got pushed back to the GTA IV delay. Now that that\u2019s going to be shipped soon, is that going to be pushed back up to the top of the priority list for you guys? And how does your ability to grow the business in fiscal \u201909 get impacted by your ability to do or not do a deal with Rockstar? Thanks. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks for the question. I [beg] the question though because we have never commented on the internal workings of our discussions with specific employees and it just would be inappropriate and certainly we wouldn\u2019t start today. We think we have the most talented, creative people in the business. Incidentally, we think we have the most talented business people in the business as well and when we have something to say about our ongoing relationships with certain people, we will do so. ", "Benjamin Feder", "On the topic of Rockstar, I wanted to add some information that Mike Hickey asked before, because I\u2019m not sure it came out completely the way it should have but we are releasing additional episodic content on Grand Theft Auto IV for Xbox 360 and sequels to some of our Rockstar triple A titles and I wanted to make sure you had the correct information. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "So just to finish it off, we value the relationship with Rockstar greatly. Their creative prowess and ability and commitment, focus, and dedication is unmatched in the industry. You are going to see just one piece of evidence of that on April 29th, but that\u2019s not the only piece of evidence. There are a lot of other great games. And then there are a lot of other great games and entertainment coming from the rest of our company as well. It\u2019s the thing we\u2019re most proud of. But to comment on people\u2019s individual relationships with the company just is -- it\u2019s never something that we\u2019ve done and we\u2019re not starting now. ", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Company", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Good afternoon. A couple of questions; first of all, can you give us an idea just to follow-on the episodic content of GTA, how we should model that out in terms of the economics around that?", "Benjamin Feder", "You know, we haven\u2019t really discussed pricing. We haven\u2019t discussed downloads. We have I think -- you obviously model what you need to model, but we haven\u2019t disclosed anything and neither has Microsoft, so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t provide any new information today. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay and looking at the headcount, can you give us an idea as to what the headcount is at the studio as well as the overall headcount?", "Lainie Goldstein", "The total studio count is about 1,350 people right now, after the acquisition of 2K Czech, and our total headcount is about 2,100 employees. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, and then as we look at GTA IV, what sort of a -- how should we look at the annual contribution of revenues coming in the second quarter versus the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year? How are you thinking of it this go-round?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We haven\u2019t really shared our launch quantities yet and we are giving our guidance for Q2 overall, but we haven\u2019t shared our specific numbers for Q3 and Q4 yet. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "I think we have said in the past that when it was a Christmas release, you would have expected a bulk of orders to come in a shorter period of time. We would expect it to be more extended, given that it\u2019s not in the Christmas season. ", "Benjamin Feder", "We\u2019re also seeing a lot of leverage in our catalog in general. That\u2019s one of the great things about what\u2019s going on in the business right now. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we have a follow-up question from John Taylor with Arcadia Investment Corporation.", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Let\u2019s see -- I didn\u2019t expect to get in that early. I think Edward asked that question about the economics. Since you are giving us some guidance that we are going to see revenue from the episodic, I think it would be really helpful if you could give us a couple of hints in terms of how that might hit certain line items in the fourth quarter. Because I mean -- or are you going to book the whole amount that\u2019s in the current, or is that a 12-month thing? I mean, can you give us any way of thinking about how that chunk of revenue comes in?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, we definitely plan on having one of the episodes during fiscal year 2008 in the fourth quarter and then one in fiscal 2009, and we are able to recognize the revenue as we meet our obligations, so that\u2019s how we are going to recognize the revenue. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "So is there -- is there capitalized development cost against that that\u2019s going to be amortized off?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "You can\u2019t give us any hint though in terms of contribution margin or anything like that?", "Lainie Goldstein", "No, we can\u2019t. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Okay. You might think about that, because that\u2019s clearly going to have a pretty big impact and it would be helpful for us to know how you are thinking about that. Anyway, thanks. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Thanks for the feedback. We\u2019ll consider it. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we have a follow-up question from Ben Schachter with UBS Securities. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "", "I\u2019m following up on JT's question about capitalized software -- how should we think about how that will decline in Q2 when the game is released?", "Lainie Goldstein", "In Q2 it will match with the revenue as we ship the product, so it\u2019s going to be amortized as we recognize the revenue over the life of the product. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "", "Do you have any sense of where you are going to end up with the capitalized software at the end -- when you report Q2?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We have it in our overall forecast but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve shared with the public. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "", "And specifically on GTA IV, what percentage of the revenue and units do you think will come from the special editions, the higher price?", "Lainie Goldstein", "It\u2019s a pretty small amount but we haven\u2019t shared the exact percentage yet. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "", "Okay, and then the last question, the music genre obviously has performed exceedingly well. The history of Rockstar and some of you folks over -- Zelnick has been in the music business. Is that a genre that you anticipate getting into on the videogame side of things?", "Benjamin Feder", "You know, we\u2019re a pretty creatively driven shop, Ben and the music on GTA is fantastic. There\u2019s music in Midnight Club, which is fantastic. And we\u2019ll continue to explore that. I think it adds a terrific game experience to the games. It\u2019s an immersive experience. It\u2019s an exciting and emotional experience and music is a key part of that. ", "I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d call music a genre. I think it\u2019s a part of the total experience and that\u2019s what GTA is -- it\u2019s one of the best gaming experiences on the planet, and so we\u2019ll continue to explore that and the guys at Rockstar are some of the best in the business at doing that. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "", "And the last question on EA, just to clarify the timing around this; right now, you are not talking with the company but you\u2019ve told them that you are willing to talk after the release of the game and that they, as far as you know, don\u2019t want to do that and want to speak now?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, no. I mean, it\u2019s what I said at the beginning of the call -- we\u2019ve disclosed everything. It\u2019s all out there in the public and there\u2019s absolutely nothing new to say. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Strauss Zelnick.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thank you so much for joining us today. As you can imagine, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about how things are going and we feel good about the rest of the year. Thanks so much for joining us.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Cindy Buckwalter, Executive Vice President for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you, Ms. Buckwalter. You may begin. ", "Cindy Buckwalter", "Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us today. Today\u2019s call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Chairman of Take-Two; Ben Feder, our CEO; and Lainie Goldstein, our CFO. We are also joined by Seth Krauss, our Chief Legal Counsel. Our team will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. ", "Before we begin, I would first like to quickly review our Safe Harbor statement by reminding everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors, including the risks related to Electronic Arts\u2019 tender offer. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007, and our 10-Q for the first quarter ended January 31, 2008. These filings may be obtained from our website at www.taketwogames.com or by contacting the SEC. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Cindy and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We are pleased to report very strong second quarter results that beat both our own guidance and analyst expectations, continuing the trend of the prior three quarters. Based on our excellent results year-to-date, as well as our positive outlook for the balance of fiscal 2008, we\u2019ve increased our full year guidance for the second quarter this year. ", "Our performance clearly demonstrates that Take-Two is creating significant stockholder value, primarily through the efforts of our Rockstar and 2K labels, who are producing the best interactive entertainment on the market today. ", "I should note that it\u2019s early days yet. We are only one year into the revitalization of this company. We still have much more to achieve. That said, I am most pleased with the progress we are making so far in transforming Take-Two into the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient company in our industry. ", "Clearly the major factor in our performance this quarter was Grand Theft Auto 4. While the tremendous consumer, critical, and media acclaim for the game speaks for itself, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the entire Rockstar Games team on this stunning achievement. It\u2019s been widely reported that GTA 4 had the largest debut of any entertainment product in history. Now, we always knew GTA 4 would be a triumph and it success has blown away not only our own expectations but those of its millions of fans as well. ", "We have proven our ability to create powerful entertainment franchises whose value extends beyond the traditional interactive entertainment market. This is illustrated by the deal we announced last month for a Bioshock feature film to be produced and directed by Gore Verbinski, director of Pirates of the Caribbean.  Our partnership with top film industry talent speaks volumes about the value we are creating at Take-Two. ", "The fact is our industry is now a source of entertainment that can equal or surpass both in consumer appeal and economic strength more established media, such as film, television, music, or books. This reaffirms our enormous confidence in the future potential of our industry in general and Take-Two in particular. ", "In addition to the successes on the creative front, Take-Two has also executed on initiatives to expand our development talent and our geographic reach. Ben is going to talk about these in a few moments. ", "Before I turn the call over to Ben, I would like to give you a brief update on the company\u2019s efforts to maximize stockholder value. As you know, at the time of EA\u2019s highly conditional, unsolicited tender offer, we emphasized the board\u2019s commitment to explore all strategic alternatives, including remaining independent and pursuing business combinations with third parties. We said we were willing to begin formal discussions with interested parties on April 30th following the launch of Grand Theft Auto 4 and we are actively engaged in that process now. ", "In fact, we have had and continue to have formal discussions with a number of interested parties. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to comment further on the status of our efforts at this time. ", "Now Ben will provide an overview of the quarter\u2019s results and highlight some of the initiatives we are pursuing to continue to grow the business and realize its exciting potential. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Thanks, Strauss. We are extremely pleased with our second quarter results. I will review some of the financial highlights and then Lainie will provide further detail in a few moments. ", "Net revenue for the quarter was $540 million, more than double the $205 million we reported in Q2 last year. Earnings on a non-GAAP basis were $1.52 per share, reversing net losses in the year-ago period in the first quarter. Based on our strong Q2 results and favorable outlook on the balance of the year, we are raising our fiscal year 2000 guidance with -- excuse me, $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $1.65 to $1.85. ", "The company\u2019s cash position has increased from Q1 by approximately $18 million and we\u2019ve paid down $20 million of our credit line. Our cash balance will be significantly higher by the end of Q3 as the substantial orders we\u2019ve received for GTA 4 late in the second quarter convert to cash. ", "We are very proud of our accomplishments in Q2. I would like to thank everyone at Rockstar Games as well as the teams at Jack Of All Games and the entire Take-Two team, all of whom contributed to the successful launch of GTA 4. ", "GTA 4\u2019s performance in the marketplace has continued to be extremely strong post-launch. As of May 31st, we\u2019ve sold over 11 million units into retail channels worldwide, with approximately $8.5 million of those units sold through to consumers. The game has broad global appeal and is the best-selling interactive entertainment title in North America and has broken sales records in Europe. ", "It is also a cultural phenomenon. The New York Times, L.A. Times, Wall Street Journal, Variety, Newsweek and countless other publications have lauded the game\u2019s breathtaking technological and artistic achievements. Even national public radio remarked on how much they enjoyed listening to public liberty radio in the game. ", "On the commercial side, GTA 4 earned a Guinness world record for the highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours. And by one account, GTA 4 single-handedly propped up the U.K. economy by helping retail sales for April and exceeding expectations. ", "GTA 4 should continue to deliver value for Take-Two well into the future. For example, GTA San Andreas sold 12 million units in the first four months through January 2005 and went on to sell another 9.5 million units since that time. This is proof positive of the longevity of the extraordinary franchise, a track record that we expect to be reflected in the performance of GTA 4. ", "I would like to comment on a few other factors that contributed to the stronger-than-expected results in the second quarter. We are very, very pleased of the continued strength of Carnival Games and other catalog titles. We are continuing to see the positive impact of our cost reduction initiatives. ", "I also want to emphasize -- the actions we have taken during the second quarter to broaden the product portfolio, expand our development resources and extend the reach of our intellectual property into the Asian market. Each of these initiatives is intended to strengthen our capacity to deliver profitable growth and stockholder value. ", "Turning for a moment to our product portfolio, Take-Two's pipeline today is the strongest, most diverse, and the most exciting in the company\u2019s history. All of our labels -- Rockstar, 2K Games, 2K Play, and 2K Sports -- are producing some of their best and most creative work ever. We are developing new versions of many of our strongest franchises, as well as a number of new brands. ", "While the full list of titles in progress is too extensive to mention, I will highlight a few that are particularly exciting for the summer and the fall of fiscal 2008. Rockstar\u2019s lineup for the second half includes Midnight Club Los Angeles for Xbox 360 and PS3 and Midnight Club L.A. Remix for PSP. 2K Games will release the highly anticipated Sid Meier Civilization Revolution for Xbox 360, PS3, and DS. The successful Bioshock franchise will be extended with a new version for PS3. We\u2019ve sold over 2.2 million units of this blockbuster title on Xbox 360 and PC to date. ", "Continuing the growth of our casual games business, 2K Play will reveal Carnival Games for DS and Carnival Games mini-golf for Wii. Carnival Games for the Wii has sold over 1.5 million units so far and the title is still going strong at retail. The DS title is shipping in July and is receiving strong support from Nintendo, who is currently offering it on their demo download stations in stores, and are also planning to have demos of the title place on their in-store kiosks. ", "2K Sports has an extensive roster, including Top Spin 3 for PS3, Wii, Xbox 360 and DS, and Don King Presents Prizefighter for Xbox 360, Wii, and DS. ", "We are also pleased MLB -- excuse me; we\u2019ll also release MLB Power Pros 2008 for Wii, PS2, and DS, as well as NHL 2K9 and NBA 2K9 for multiple platforms. ", "Let\u2019s look for a moment at our fiscal 2009 lineup and we\u2019ve already announced some of our key titles -- Bioshock 2, Mafia 2, Borderland, and we\u2019ve also announced today that we will release the first installment of episodic content for GTA 4 for Xbox 360 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We think the 2009 release of this highly anticipated episode will provide better balance among our top titles and further strengthens our fiscal 2009 release schedule, and we\u2019ll have more to say about our 2009 lineup in the coming months. ", "We\u2019ve continued to make investments to expand our creative resources and extend our global market presence. Since we spoke with you in March, we enhanced our world-class development capabilities by forming Rockstar New England through the acquisition of Mad Dog Software. The team at Mad Dog is extremely talented and accomplished, and most recently worked with Rockstar on Xbox 360 version of the critically acclaimed Bully Scholarship Edition. ", "We are also actively targeting opportunities in the fast-growing Asia market where we already have a solid foothold thanks to the global popularity of our products. Recently we named Hubert Larenaudie, formerly of Electronic Arts and Vivendi Universal Games, to the newly appointed -- newly created position of President for Asia.  Hubert will be establishing an office in Singapore as the focal point for our Asia operations. His track record of building leading market positions in South Korea, China, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and his experience in growing an online games business will be important to our efforts to build critical mass in the Asia-Pacific region. ", "We have several priorities in the Asia-Pacific market. In addition to expanding distribution in the region for our products and developing a strong presence in Japan, we also intend to establish an online game operation with particular focus on China and Korea. We are confident in Take-Two's ability to achieve growth in Asia and we are proud to have attracted an executive of Hubert\u2019s caliber to help leverage the opportunities we have at Take-Two. ", "I want to thank our employees for remaining focused during what could have been a very distracting time on developing, marketing, and selling great interactive entertainment and driving value for our stockholders. We are very pleased with 2K\u2019s -- excuse me, with Take-Two's strong performance in the first half of 2008. We are extremely confident in the future of our business. ", "Take-Two is delivering on the potential we saw when we joined the company only a year ago. We are continuing to invest in great products, expanded creative resources, and a global market presence. ", "I would like now to turn the call over to Lainie. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Ben and good afternoon, everyone. I will be covering several topics today. First a review of second quarter results; second, our outlook for fiscal 2008; and third, our guidance for the third and fourth quarter. Let\u2019s look at our Q2 results. ", "Net revenue was $540 million compared with $205 million a year ago. Non-GAAP net income was $115.4 million compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $29.2 million last year, with earnings per share of $1.52 compared to a loss of $0.41 last year. Please see today\u2019s press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers. ", "We are really pleased that we are exceeding our guidance for our fourth quarter in a row. Sales of Grand Theft Auto 4 surpassed our expectations and was the primary reason for our better than expected performance. ", "Our GAAP results for the second quarter were net income of approximately $98.2 million or $1.29 per share, compared with a net loss of $51.2 million or $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2007. ", "Our GAAP results included $12.4 million in stock-based compensation expense and a total of $4.7 million in expenses related to professional fees and legal expenses related to unusual matters, as well as business reorganization costs. Professional fees related to the EA tender offer were $3.4 million of the $4.7 million total. ", "Our leading title in Q2 was Grand Theft Auto 4, which launched worldwide on April 29th. Other top titles in the quarter were Major League Baseball 2K8, Bully Scholarship Edition, Carnival Games, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. ", "Jack Of All Games business also grew, led by strong current generation hardware and software sales, especially the Wii. ", "In looking at our consolidated results, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 4.2% compared to 25.1% last year. This is primarily due to our revenue mix as publishing was 90% of total revenue and our high margin, internally owned and developed Grand Theft Auto 4 title was a significant percentage of our publishing revenue. ", "Our split between North America and international revenue was 65% to 35% in Q2. If you back out sports in our distribution business and look at this number for the last 12 months, our North America international revenue split was about 60% to 40%, compared to about 55% to 45% for the same 12 month period a year ago. ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were approximately $108 million, up from last year\u2019s second quarter for the following reasons. Sales and marketing expenses accounted for the largest increase in operating expenses year over year, mainly due to the launch of Grand Theft Auto 4 and Bully Scholarship Edition this year. The G&A expenses increased compared to last year due primarily to increased incentive compensation and professional fees and a $3.9 million increase in our provision for bad debt expense. These increases were somewhat offset by approximately $2 million of cost saving initiatives. Our tax expense was primarily for our earnings in our international territories. ", "Moving on to our balance sheet, at the end of Q2 we had approximately $73 million in cash and $60 million of borrowings on our credit line. Based on our significant GTA 4 sales, we expect to begin to generate cash this quarter as receivables convert to cash. ", "Our accounts receivable reserve was about $67 million at the end of the quarter, which represented approximately 16% of gross receivables. ", "Inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately $92 million, up from the same period last year due to the significantly higher business volume. ", "The increase in our software development costs and licenses is primarily related to our key titles planned for release over the next 12 to 18 months. We currently have approximately 33 titles in various stages of development. ", "Now to our outlook for fiscal 2008 -- we are raising the guidance that we previously provided in March to reflect the better than expected performance of Grand Theft Auto 4, partially offset by the move the first episodic content for GTA 4 for Xbox 360 from fiscal 2008 into fiscal 2009. Additionally, we no longer anticipate reaching profitability in our 2K Sports business in fiscal 2008 and I will discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. ", "We now expect $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in revenue and $1.65 to $1.85 in earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis. The primary assumptions underlining the guidance are as follows: we expect the net revenue breakdown in our publishing business to be approximately 70% from Rockstar, 15% from 2K Sports, and 15% from 2K Games and 2K Play. While we have previously expected 2K Sports to turn profitable in fiscal 2008, we are currently forecasting a loss in our sports business. ", "We experienced lower attach rates than we expected on the increased install base of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 hardware. ", "On the expense side, sales and marketing is closely tied to our product releases. We expect a larger marketing spend in absolute dollars in 2008. However, sales and marketing expenses should be relatively stable as a percentage of sale. ", "R&D expense continues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the products in development. On an annual basis, we expect total R&D expenses to increase about 45%, primarily due to the acquisition of Illusion Software, Mad Dog, and continued investment in our development studios. ", "We are seeing a significant portion of the expected cost reductions in the G&A area, although the annual benefit of our cost savings initiatives won\u2019t be realized until fiscal 2009. Offsetting the cost efficiencies, our 2008 G&A levels reflect increased professional fees. In addition, we\u2019ll have higher employee incentive compensation expense based on the company\u2019s strong performance and we established a $4 million reserve for bad debt expense in Q2. ", "Overall, we see 2008 G&A levels increasing by approximately 7% in absolute dollars compared to 2007. ", "Depreciation and amortization should increase modestly and based on our current forecasts, we anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be about 10% to 12% in fiscal 2008, and for Q3 and Q4, we expect to show a small tax provision, primarily for our international business. ", "We are issuing guidance today for the third and fourth quarters. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $0.45 to $0.55 on $325 million to $375 million in revenue. This excludes stock-based compensation expense of $0.17 per share and expenses related to unusual matters and reorganization costs of $0.13 per share. ", "Our Q3 key releases are Sid Meier Civilization Revolution, Top Spin 3, Don King Presents Prizefighter, and Carnival Games on the DS. ", "Let me discuss some additional data points on our Q3 outlook. We expect our revenue mix to remain heavily weighted towards publishing due to the launch of the Q3 titles I mentioned and the continued strength of Grand Theft Auto 4. ", "While we expect to see continued strong sales of GTA 4 in Q3, our gross profit margins will decrease slightly due to the launch of several new 2K titles in Q3, and for the full year we expect gross margins of approximately 36%. ", "On a non-GAAP basis, we expect overall operating expenses to trend up slightly in Q3 as compared to Q2, primarily driven by higher expense for the continued support of Grand Theft Auto 4 and marketing preceding the launch of Midnight Club Los Angeles, as well as our 2K titles. ", "R&D expense will also increase from Q2 due to the acquisition of Mad Dog. Lower capitalization rates following the release of GTA 4 and a continued investment in our internal studios. These increases will be partially offset by a decrease in G&A expense due to the continued implementation of our cost savings initiatives and the bad debt reserve that was set up during Q2. ", "For Q4, our key releases are Midnight Club Los Angeles, Bioshock for PlayStation 3, NBA 2K9, NHL 2K9, and Carnival Games Mini-Golf for the Wii. ", "For Q4, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.20 on $300 million to $350 million in revenue. This includes stock-based compensation expense of $0.18 per share and expenses related to unusual matters and reorganization costs of $0.01 per share. ", "Our Q4 releases are more broadly distributed among the labels and include our NBA and NHL titles, so we expect gross margin -- gross profit margin to decrease into the low 30s in that quarter. ", "On a non-GAAP basis, we expect overall operating expenses relatively flat in Q4 as compared to Q3. ", "Selling and marketing expenses are increasing slightly, primarily driven by higher marketing spend for the continued support of Grand Theft Auto 4, the launch of Midnight Club Los Angeles, as well as the launch of our key sports and other 2K titles. ", "This increase should be offset by several factors. G&A expense will decrease slightly from Q3 due to our continued cost-savings initiatives and we also expense R&D expense to trend down slightly from Q3 as we see our capitalization rates increase in Q4. ", "Looking ahead, we are building a strong lineup for fiscal 2009 that will include sequels to some of Rockstar\u2019s Triple A brand and episodic content for Grand Theft Auto 4 and Xbox 360. 2K Games key Triple A titles will include Borderlands, Mafia 2, Bioshock 2, and 2K Sports will deliver their recurring sports titles. 2K Play will publish additional Nick Jr. products under their agreement with Nickelodeon. We\u2019ll be expanding our downloadable content as well as other ancillary revenue streams. ", "We also expect to see growth in the Asia-Pacific market as a result of our new initiatives in that region. ", "Fiscal 2009 will also reflect the first full year of our cost savings initiatives and we are very optimistic about our future and the opportunities to further develop shareholder value. ", "At this point, I will turn the call back to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Lainie. To summarize, Take-Two's performance for the first half of fiscal 2008 clearly shows the strong results this company is capable of producing and demonstrates our potential for continued value creation. With our diverse portfolio of popular franchises, unparalleled creative talent, and a vastly improved operational and financial picture, Take-Two is in a unique position to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the current industry cycle. We look forward to translating those strengths into increasing value for our stockholders and we\u2019ll now be glad to take your questions. Operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with Lehman Brothers. ", "Eric Handler - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you very much. Given your improved outlook from this year, can you give us a sense of what free cash flow generation might look like? And then secondly, in terms of your Asian expansion, what titles do you expect are going to be the first that you might look to monetize online or lead the charge there?", "Benjamin Feder", "Your first question with respect to cash flow, we don\u2019t actually provide it, as you know, so I\u2019m going to defer on that one. And with respect to Asia, we have a goal -- well, not a goal but we have some very important and valuable brands that translate very well to Japan, to China, to Korea. We are not in a position yet to describe or to articulate which brands we\u2019ll be leading with, except to say that we think that there\u2019s a huge opportunity for multiple franchises at Take-Two and a bunch of different territories within Asia. And as you know, Asia is a fairly large place. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Eric, on the cash flow point, obviously we have disclosed our gross margins a little better than expected and obviously you know that this business generates cash when it does well, and we are certainly doing well. ", "Eric Handler - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, and then just as a follow-up, with Asia should we assume that you are not going to be getting the packaged goods there, most of it -- all of it should be online initiatives?", "Benjamin Feder", "We tend to follow the market and Japan is really the key market where console -- we tend to be console oriented, although we also launch on PCs but the console market pretty much in Japan -- in Asia is pretty much in Japan and the rest of it is online or PC. ", "Eric Handler - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Schachter with UBS. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "Congratulations on a nice quarter and a great launch of the game. I\u2019m not sure if you said this at the beginning of the call, but did you give a percentage of revenues from GTA?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We didn\u2019t give that specific information but I can tell you that GTA 4 and our catalog for GTA in total is approximately 78% of our total publishing revenue in the quarter. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "Okay. Just back of the envelope math, that implies an internal royalty rate what, of about 15% or so, 14%, 15%? Is that -- ", "Lainie Goldstein", "We don\u2019t provide that information, Ben, but in our press release today as well as in our 10-Q, we do break out internal royalties and it\u2019s not all for GTA 4 or for the Rockstar label but it primarily would be for this quarter based on the revenue. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "Okay. Strauss, if you could just remind us in terms of the comment you said before about formal talks, just remind us of the process through which you have let the SEC know when you are in talks, or if you have to file something when you are in talks?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We have to file if and when we are in negotiations, to be specific. Discussions and negotiations, there are terms of art around those and we are in formal discussions right now, not in negotiations. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "Okay. Any comments on the FTC, what are the key issues there?", "Strauss Zelnick", "No, I think we\u2019ve been -- as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve endeavored to cooperate as much as possible. We put out some information on that today. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "Okay, and then the last question, the music genre, given Rockstar\u2019s heritage, is that an area we should expect that you guys might be interested in?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Possibly. You know, there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve disclosed on the release schedule right now. I think that\u2019s a long conversation and not a short one in terms of where the business is going. You know, is it a music genre, is it a rhythm genre -- it also remains to be seen how that genre holds up over time and that\u2019s terribly important when you invest in triple A properties that you expect people to play for upwards of 20 hours. So probably a better conversation to have over a cup of coffee, but the answer is the release schedule doesn\u2019t include any rhythm titles right now. ", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "Well, I will take you up on that and thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "My congratulations too on the outstanding launch of GTA 4. I was wondering if you could tell us what the current level of cash is following collection of some of the receivables on GTA 4. And also on the 33 titles that you have in development, could we get a platform breakdown?", "And also, the level of R&D staff at the end of the quarter and where you expect that to be at the end of the year, at the end of the fiscal year?", "Lainie Goldstein", "I\u2019ll take the first question first on the current level of our cash. We provided our balance sheet information as of Q2 today and we do provide our cash on a quarterly basis but we don\u2019t provide mid-quarter updates, but our cash will be significantly higher by the end of Q3 as our orders that we received for GTA 4 convert into cash, which we mentioned earlier. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, and a platform breakdown on the number of titles?", "Lainie Goldstein", "I\u2019ll have to get back to you on that, Ed. I don\u2019t have that in front of me. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then lastly, just the R&D stuff at the end of the quarter and where you expect that to be at year-end?", "Lainie Goldstein", "At the end of the quarter, we\u2019re about 1,350 employees and I don\u2019t have the exact forecast for year-end but it would probably be about that number or growing slightly based on our development schedule. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Gikas with Piper Jaffray.", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Good afternoon, guys. Great job during the quarter. A few questions -- I\u2019ll start out with some GTA type questions. Could you share with us what GTA 4 was shipped or sold on an international basis? Number two, can you talk a little bit about where the development of the downloadable or episodic content for GTA 4 is? Is that well along in terms of completion there? And then perhaps anything that you could share with us in terms of pricing of that episodic content as that starts to roll out in the new fiscal year? And then I have a follow-up. ", "Benjamin Feder", "In terms of GTA, pretty much all of it is kind of a typical international versus domestic breakdown. It pretty much followed the typical pattern for our games and that means slightly over 50% for the U.S., just over 50%. So rough rule of thumb, about half and half. And that\u2019s rough. ", "On the episodic content, I think the question you are asking is kind of is there an issue in the game? The reason we moved the episodic content into FY09 is really for portfolio balancing more than anything else, and we don\u2019t anticipate any issues with the release of that, other than delaying it for portfolio balancing reasons. ", "And your price -- and the question on pricing for the title, we haven\u2019t disclosed that yet and aren\u2019t prepared to do so today. ", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Was the episodic content developed alongside the game, so there really isn\u2019t a lot to kind of finishing it or is that in sort of a separate project?", "Benjamin Feder", "You know, it\u2019s the same team developing it and the same studio that is developing it, but again the delay is not about development issues. The delay is about portfolio balancing issues. ", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, and then last question on GTA -- any update for us or announcement on a potential handheld version of GTA 4?", "Benjamin Feder", "Nothing to announce today, sorry. ", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then how did Jack Of All Games perform in the quarter? Is there anything you can share there in terms of the profitability of that business? Are you still seeking any alternatives for that division?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Jack Of All Games did very well this quarter. Their margins are running from the mid to high -- I\u2019m sorry, mid- to high-single-digits and we are still working on gaining efficiencies in the business and we don\u2019t have any current plans to sell the business. We are really working on running the business as efficiently as possible. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "And things are going well. ", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, so that would be a 5% to 10% gross margin, is that what you are talking about?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes, gross margin. ", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then last question, could you just talk a little bit about what types of partnerships that the company is considering at this point? Is this intellectual properties or development partnerships, distribution?", "Strauss Zelnick", "I\u2019m not sure -- in what context are you asking about partnerships?", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "In the context -- earlier in the call you said that you were, you know, the company was seeking strategic alternatives. I guess in that context. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, basically we\u2019ve said we have our eyes open to anything that maximize stockholder value, including remaining independent or possibly business combinations or anything else that might come up as we examine those alternatives. We really can\u2019t be anymore specific than that right now. ", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of  Mike Hickey, Janco Partners.", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Hey, guys. Congratulations on a wonderful quarter and certainly congratulations to the Rockstar team for putting a tremendous title into the market. It\u2019s absolutely awesome. Just curious on your guidance for Q3, if I understand that right 78% of your publishing sales for the quarter were from Grand Theft Auto 4 and catalog. It was about $380 million or so I think. And thinking about average wholesale price is $56, it would be about 5.7 million units shipped in Q2. Does that sound about right?", "Lainie Goldstein", "No, it\u2019s a little on the high side there. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay, because you\u2019ve already shipped 11 million units through May 31st, right?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay, so even if I\u2019m high, if I assume that you have about 5 million units that go into this quarter, average wholesale price is $56, that\u2019s getting into about $330 million in sales and that\u2019s within your guidance range already?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Could you repeat the question, Mike? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following you. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "If you\u2019ve shipped 6 million units roughly, and that\u2019s high for Q2, and Q3 you said that through May 31st, you\u2019ve shipped 11, so if I net our 5 and assume an average wholesale price of $56, wouldn\u2019t that be about $330 million in sales?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Mike, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear you the first time. The number you gave me for the units I thought you said was a different number, so you are actually a little bit low there for Q2. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "I\u2019m a little low for Q2?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yeah, you\u2019re pretty low. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Mike, not to build your model on the call here, but -- ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "All right. It just looks like it\u2019s a little conservative. ", "Benjamin Feder", "We announced for first week sales would sell through to consumers. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Right. Okay. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Let\u2019s not build your model on the call. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay. And then if you could just give us a little bit of color how your development teams are working through EA\u2019s hostile bid?", "Strauss Zelnick", "I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that despite distractions, everyone has their head down and a smile on their face and is getting the job done, and we are very -- immensely grateful to the team, to the Rockstar Label, to the 2K label, to all of our management, our sales management, distribution management, and corporate management worldwide for staying focused on the job at hand and staying focused on building this company and building shareholder value. And that\u2019s our job and I think everyone\u2019s done a remarkable job staying focused and we are -- as I said, we are immensely grateful for the team\u2019s terrific work under not insignificant pressure. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research. ", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Yes, thanks for taking my call. Two, if I might; first, can you talk about what\u2019s changed in the sports business since we last talked, that now it\u2019s not going to make break-even? And then, can you give us a sense of the scale of the expected loss for the fiscal year?", "And then secondly, if I look at everything you\u2019ve done on the revitalization plan that you set out in kind of the first 100 day call, it sounds like you made all of it except for the sports element. Could you talk about what else you might go attack next in the business, either over the next year or if you have the opportunity to do this in the next three years? What else can you -- that you\u2019ve seen in the year you\u2019ve been there of where you can take the business? Thanks. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "On the sports side, the primary reasons for our lack of profitability were lower attach rates than we expected on the increased installed base of Xbox 360 and PS3 hardware, and we made some changes in the release schedule that obviously reduced the revenue a bit. ", "I think you asked how serious is it and the answer is you know, we take our job seriously across the board. As I said earlier, this was a work in progress. We are committed to the sports business and we feel like we are going to get there and we are disappointed that we haven\u2019t gotten across the finish this year. We are keeping focused on doing just that. How are we going to do it? Continuing to make the best titles in the business that rate better than the competition head to head. I think we have the best developers in the business and I believe we can continue to do that. ", "In terms of your comments about the 100 day plan, I guess maybe we are a little more self-critical than you were. This is a wonderful organization and everyone here also agrees we can do better, and some of the opportunities that we\u2019ve outlined previously are really going to be market driven. They are going to benefit everyone in the market. This business becomes more of a multi-player business, there\u2019s an opportunity for micropayments and subscription businesses. There\u2019s really terrific economic opportunities out there. ", "Our focus is on delighting our consumers. Our focus is in bringing consumers what they want and our experience is if you give consumers what they want and you delight them, then you tend to do well economically also. ", "So there are any number of areas that we are pursuing. I think we\u2019ve talked today about the ones about which we are most excited. Ben talked about our initiatives in Asia. That is after all the second largest market on Earth for interactive entertainment and we need to participate in that market. In general, we think international is a big growth area. ", "You know, when we talk about being the most creative, the most efficient, and the most innovative, you know I think we do have the most creative company here. Our vast collection of owned intellectual property and our unparalleled development team speak for themselves. ", "I do think we have the most efficient organization pound for pound in this business. I am really proud of the steps this team has taken to do so and to do that for our business. I think we still have a long way to go in innovation. I think we all feel that we do and frankly, we want to turn our attention to that and are turning our attention to that and that\u2019s not something that delivers results overnight. It is something that delivers results over time. ", "One of the most wonderful things about interactive entertainment is as exciting a time as this for the Take-Two organization at large, the wind\u2019s at our back and there\u2019s a lot of interesting stuff that is going to happen in the next few years in this business. ", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Great, thanks, and just to clarify the sport question, the second part of my comment there or question there was can you give us a sense of the scale of what the loss will be this year?", "Strauss Zelnick", "You know, we don\u2019t break it out but obviously we are having -- you know, we\u2019re having a terrifically sound year and our guidance today reflects that, so I think you can arrive at your own conclusions. ", "Benjamin Feder", "In the context of everything else that is going on in the company, it\u2019s certainly something that we can manage -- but the guidance [kinds of speak for itself]. ", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Got it. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities. ", "Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you. Two questions -- I\u2019m not sure how simple this would be to do but would you ever look at divesting different labels or brands to 2K Sports or the games division, just to maximize shareholder value as you go through this process? And second, can you just remind us what your NOLs look like for U.S. and international? Thank you. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "I don\u2019t think it would maximize shareholder value to piece apart the company and we really would be -- you know, we\u2019d be loathe to do that because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s how you create value in this business. ", "On the NOLs, Lainie. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "We don\u2019t share our NOL balance on a quarterly basis but it is in our 10-K at the end of the year, but I can tell you that we did use some of our NOLs this quarter with our income, and we do disclose in our 10-Q that we\u2019ve reduced our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets by approximately $24.5 million, which you can assume is primarily a reduction for the NOL. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Does that answer your question?", "Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank", "No, that helps. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Company", "Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the Bioshock movie deal in terms of what kind of financial impact it might have? How much creative control do you and 2K Games have over the movie and is it fair to presume the movie won\u2019t be released in time to coincide with the launch of Bioshock 2? Thanks. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "We are really excited about it but we definitely did structure this deal so that we have no economic exposure or risk. The economic exposure or risk is being borne by our production partner, Universal Pictures. We are very pleased with the upside that we -- the economic upside that we have but we really haven\u2019t -- you know, we obviously have a sense of what it is. It is not something that we normally disclose. We do feel it is something that could be very beneficial but it is at this point pretty speculative. ", "I think you\u2019re right. It\u2019s unlikely that the picture would be released coincident with Bioshock 2. It will be more likely that it would be released coincident with Bioshock 3. That also remains to be seen. ", "That said, we took enormous pains to do a couple of things that haven\u2019t been done before in the business. One is that we went directly to the studio partner. We didn\u2019t go through a production intermediary. A number of us around the table have a little bit of motion picture experience so we felt that was the best way to handle it. And we also attached to the picture up-front an A-plus producing and directing talent in Gore Verbinski, who is highly committed to getting this picture made and we also set the picture up at Universal because they are highly committed to getting the picture made. ", "So to the extent that the picture does well, we are all going to be very happy with the results and we tried very hard to put together a package that ensures that our millions of fans are going to be able to see a Bioshock movie on the big screen. That\u2019s pretty exciting. ", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Company", "Great, thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Strauss Zelnick for closing comments. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, listen, obviously we all feel terrifically gratified by the results. You know, at the risk of being repetitive, what we do around here at Take-Two is a team sport and everyone on this call today, Ben, myself, Lainie, Cindy, you know, want to thank all of our colleagues all around the world for their incredible performance. I want to emphasize the contribution of Rockstar Games and all the terrific people there who just sweated blood to make this happen, frankly as well as the entire Take-Two staff around the world that made sure we got this game into the hands of the millions of consumers so far. ", "This is the new Take-Two and we are awfully proud to be sitting at the table together, so thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Cindy Buckwalter, Executive Vice President for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you, Ms. Buckwalter; you may begin. ", "Cindy Buckwalter", "Welcome and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter conference call. Today\u2019s call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Chairman of Take-Two; Ben Feder, our CEO; and Lainie Goldstein, our CFO. Our team will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. ", "Before we begin, I would first like to quickly review our Safe Harbor statement by reminding everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. ", "These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors, including the risks associated with our process to evaluate strategic alternatives. ", "These important factors are described in our press release today and our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007 and our 10-Qs for the interim quarters of fiscal 2008. These documents may be obtained from our website at www.taketwogames.com. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks Cindy, good afternoon everyone, thanks for joining us. Take-Two\u2019s third quarter results beat expectations by a wide margin. This clearly demonstrates that our company is in terrific shape and that we\u2019re positioned to create even greater stockholder value in the future.", "We\u2019re performing well in all aspects of our business creatively, operationally and financially. From a product perspective our industry leading creative teams are building an increasingly diverse portfolio of interactive entertainment brands that are massive winners with consumers. ", "Our strong third quarter performance was driven by a broad range of [inaudible] from our powerhouse Grand Theft Auto to Civilization to newer brands like Carnival Games, as well as our sports titles led by Top Spin 3 and Major League Baseball 2K8. ", "In an industry where strong contact is a critical determinant of success, we have an increasingly formidable advantage. Operationally our ongoing efforts to drive increased efficiency have gained significant traction over the past 16 months. We have now implemented all of our previously announced cost saving measures and will reap the benefits of these initiatives going forward both in terms of higher productivity and the ability to reinvest the savings to grow our business. ", "On the financial front our third quarter results continued the trend of dramatic performance improvements that we consistently delivered throughout this fiscal year. Our top line revenue and non-GAAP EPS results once again outperformed our guidance and exceeded even the most optimistic analyst estimates.", "Before I turn the call over to Benjamin I\u2019d like to give you a brief update on our strategic review process. As you know Electronic Arts agreed to a presentation by our management team consistent with our process following the expiration of their [inaudible] tender offer. At the same time we\u2019re actively continuing our other formal discussions as we previously disclosed. ", "Our Board and management team have at all times conducted this process and its deliberate focus and reasoned manner with the goal of pursing the task that will create the greatest possible values for our stockholders. We\u2019ll continue to do so.", "Now Benjamin will discuss the third quarter results in more detail and provide us with additional detail on our creative and operational progress.", "Benjamin Feder ", "Thanks Strauss, our third quarter results were in a word fantastic. This marks the fifth quarter in a row that we\u2019ve beaten our own guidance as well as consensus expectations. Strauss and I have urged our team to remain focused on the business despite the considerable potential for distraction and their ability to do so is reflected in our strong performance.", "Net revenue for the quarter was $434 million, more than double the $206 million we reported in Q\t3 last year. Earnings on a non-GAAP basis were $0.93 per share compared with a net loss one year ago and also were sharply higher then consensus. ", "The quarter\u2019s results were driven by better then expected performance of Grand Theft Auto IV which shipped in Q2 and also our newly released titles Top Spin 3, Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization Revolution which both shipped in the third quarter.", "Our strong performance is reflected in our increased cash position. We had nearly $339 million in cash at the end of the quarter, well over $4.00 per share and paid off the balance owed on our credit line. To be clear, the company is debt free.", "I\u2019d like to expand on Strauss\u2019 point about our creative performance. Thanks to the efforts of nearly 1,400 development team members worldwide and a disciplined product investment review process, we now have the strongest and most diverse portfolio in Take-Two\u2019s history.", "Both Rockstar and 2K contributed to this quarter\u2019s outstanding performance and the proven franchises of Grand Theft Auto, Civilization, Carnival Games, Top Spin, and Major League Baseball were powerful revenue generators. ", "Grand Theft Auto IV is once again the largest single contributor to revenue in the quarter. We have continued to see increases in sell-through which rose by approximately 1.5 million units since we last spoke to you in June. We expect that the continued growth of GTA IV sales will be driven by several factors.", "First Rockstar is launching a new marketing and PR campaign which will start in the fall and extend into the holiday season. Also as a must-have game for all fans of interactive entertainment, GTA IV we believe should receive a boost from the ramp up in hardware sales during the upcoming holiday season. ", "In addition our hardware partners continue to be excited about the title and are planning to support GTA IV in a major way through early next year. The Japanese version of Grand Theft Auto IV is set for release on October 30th and the PC version is due out in November, both of which will open new chapters in the phenomenal performance of the game.", "A new GTA title, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, will be released for the Nintendo DS platform in Q1 of fiscal 2009 combining the world\u2019s largest interactive entertainment franchise and the world\u2019s largest installed base.", "Finally the release of episodic contents for Xbox 360 in fiscal 2009 will further energize sales of the original GTA IV.", "The Grand Theft Auto franchise has extremely long legs; Grand Theft Auto San Andreas sold about 12 million units in the first four months alone following launch and then approximately 11 million units over the next three years for a lifetime total sales of nearly 23 million units.", "In fact more than one million units of previous GTA titles were sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 alone. Based on GTA IV sales to date, and the factors that I just mentioned, we believe the lifetime Grand Theft Auto sales will ultimately track well ahead of any previous Grand Theft Auto titles. ", "Our creative teams have shown tremendous ingenuity in maximizing the value of our AAA franchises by extending hit titles to new platforms and new regions, specifically BioShock will make its debut on PS3 in October with all new contents that will attract new audiences to the smash hit franchise. ", "We recently launched Carnival Games for DS where it\u2019s been a solid hit building on its earlier success on the Wii. We are pleased to announce that sales of Carnival Games on Wii and DS have topped two million units to date.", "In June we announced plans to bring NHL 2K9 to the Wii making it the first NHL licensed hockey game on that platform and our experience with Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization Revolution is a striking example of our ability to raise the value of our intellectual property to new levels.", "Sid Meier\u2019s Firaxis team took a franchise that was originally built around the PC and transformed it into a breathtaking console and handheld title. We\u2019re so proud of that achievement that I want to pause for a moment and quote from a story from the New York Times on the title, which quoted, \u201cMr. Meier and his team at Firaxis Game with the support from Take-Two, has succeeded in translating the classic elements of Civilization series into a form that performs gloriously in living rooms on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 and even in handheld form on the Nintendo DS.\u201d ", "That\u2019s a fantastic endorsement and we\u2019re really, really proud of it. ", "On the topic of new creative properties, we\u2019ve announced the partnership with Cryptic Studios for their Massively Multiplayer Online Title Champions Online. This is our first venture into the MMOG field and reflects a toehold into the broadband world which we see as a very important strategic initiative.", "I\u2019d also like to mention our recent deployment of Gary Dale as Chief Operating Officer. Gary has played many valuable roles of the company and is highly experienced in publishing, global markets, sales and distribution, all of which are critically important to enhancing the value of our business.", "This is another example of our determination to operate the company as effectively, as productively as possible and even as we explore strategic alternatives.", "We\u2019re approaching the upcoming holiday season and the balance of this fiscal year with great confidence and enthusiasm. The titles that have powered our growth throughout this year should be on many shopping lists this season and we also have many strong new titles including Midnight Club: Los Angeles; the PS3 version of BioShock; the Japanese and PC versions of GTA IV; Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for DS; our NBA 2K9 and NHL 2K9 titles; Carnival Games Mini Golf for Wii; Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization IV: Colonization; as well as an assortment of Nickelodeon titles.", "At this time we\u2019re in the process of finalizing our fiscal 2009 release schedule and will provide an outlook for the full year when we\u2019ve completed this vital component our budgeting process. ", "We believe that our success in building a diverse portfolio of AAA titles while improving our operations and strengthening our financial position has given the company a solid platform for profitable growth. ", "We are delivering on our pledge to make Take-Two the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the industry and we look forward to further accomplishments in the future. ", "With that I thank you and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein ", "Thanks Benjamin and good afternoon everyone. Today I\u2019ll review our third quarter results which were terrific. To detail our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2008, let\u2019s look at our Q3 results. Net revenue was $434 million compared with $206 million a year ago. ", "Non-GAAP net income was $71.5 million compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $44.9 million last year with earnings per share of $0.93 compared to a loss of $0.62 last year. ", "Please see today\u2019s press release for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers. We are pleased that we exceeded our guidance for the fifth quarter in a row. Sales of Grand Theft Auto IV topped [Sin 3] and Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization Revolution also passed our expectations and were the primary drivers of our better then expected performance.", "Our GAAP results for the third quarter were net income of approximately $51.8 million or $0.67 per share compared with a net loss of $58.5 million or $0.81 per share in the third quarter of 2007. Our GAAP results included $12.6 million in stock based compensation expense, and a total of $7.2 million of professional fees and legal expenses related to unusual matters as well as business reorganization costs.", "Our leading title in Q3 was Grand Theft Auto IV which continued to perform extremely well. Other top titles in the quarter were Top Spin 3, Civilization Revolution, and Carnival Games. [Jack of All Games] business also grew led by strong [current] generation software sales specifically for the Wii and Playstation 3 and increased Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 hardware sales.", "And looking at our consolidated results our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 41% compared to 19% last year. This is primarily due to our revenue mix as publishing was 88% if total revenue and our top three titles in the quarter are all high margins internally owned and developed titles and were a significant percentage of publishing revenue. ", "Our split between North America and international revenue was 54% to 46% in Q3 compared to 78% to 22% in Q3 last year. Excluding our sports and distribution businesses, North America international revenues split for the trailing 12 months was about 55% to 45%.", "Non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were approximately $99 million, up from last year\u2019s third quarter for the following reasons. ", "Sales and marketing expenses accounted for the largest increase primarily due to advertising for Grand Theft Auto IV. R&D expenses increased as a result of lower software capitalization rates following the release of Grand Theft Auto IV. We also continued to invest in our development studios including the three additional studios we\u2019ve opened or acquired this year; 2K [Chek], 2K [Moran] and Rockstar New England. ", "Also G&A expenses increased compared to last year due primarily to increased incentive compensation and professional fees and the G&A costs related to our three new development studios and our newly established Asian operation.", "These increases were partially offset by approximately $2 million of cost savings initiatives. Our tax expenses primarily for our earnings in international territories. Moving on to our balance sheet at the end of Q3 we had over $338 million in cash or approximately $4.37 per share. During the quarter we paid down $18 million on our line of credit and we currently have no borrowings.", "Our accounts receivable reserve is about $58 million at the end of the quarter which represents an approximately 35% of gross receivables. Inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately $72 million, down slightly from this time last year.", "The increase in our software development costs and licenses from year end is primarily related to key titles planned for release over the next 12 to 18 months. We currently have approximately 35 titles in various stages of development. ", "Now to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2008, we are raising our fiscal 2008 guidance to reflect a better then expected performance in Q3. We now expect $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion in revenue and $2.08 to $2.12 in earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis. ", "This excludes stock based compensation expense of $0.59 per share and expenses related to unusual matters and new organization costs of $0.21 per share.", "For Q4 we are revising our guidance slightly to reflect the following factors. The movement of Midnight Club: Los Angeles, to late October which we believe is a more favorable market window for the title. While the title is still shipping in Q4 we will be capturing only about a week of sales in the quarter. ", "We also moved the DS and Wii versions of Don King Presents: Prizefighter along with the 360 platform for certain international territories from the fourth quarter to fiscal 2009 to allow additional development time.", "Additionally since the sales line for Grand Theft Auto IV is already substantially ahead of our expectations year-to-date we are maintaining a conservative outlook for Q4. For Q4 we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $0.01 to $0.05 on $285 million to $335 million in revenue.", "This excludes stock based compensation expense of $0.18 per share and expenses related to unusual matters and reorganization costs of $0.03 per share. ", "For Q4 our remaining queue releases are Midnight Club: Los Angeles, BioShock for Playstation 3, NBA 2K9, NHL 2K9, Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization IV: Colonization, and Carnival Games: Mini Golf for the Wii.", "Our Q4 releases are more broadly distributed among the labels and include our licensed NBA and NHL titles. We expect gross profit margins to decrease to the low 30s in this quarter. On a non-GAAP basis we expect overall operating expenses to trend up in Q4 as compared to Q3 primarily for the following reasons.", "Selling and marketing expenses are increasing significantly driven by higher marketing spend for Grand Theft Auto IV, the release of Midnight Club: Los Angeles, as well as the launch of our key sports and other 2K titles. ", "We also expect R&D expense to increase from Q3 as we continue to invest in our studios. Looking ahead we\u2019re building a strong lineup for fiscal 2009. Ben already mentioned our holiday titles and in addition to those releases we\u2019ll have sequels to some of Rockstar\u2019s AAA brands. ", "2K\u2019s key AAA titles will include Borderland, Mafia 2, BioShock 2, Champions Online, and a full roster of sports titles. 2K play will publish additional Nick Junior products. We\u2019ll be expanding our downloadable content business as well as the revenue streams and expect to see growth in the Asia Pacific market as the result of our entry into that region.", "Fiscal 2009 will also reflect the first full year of our cost savings initiatives. We\u2019re optimistic about our future and the opportunities to further build stockholder value. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick ", "Thanks Lainie, fiscal 2008 continues to be a transformative year for Take-Two. We have broadened our portfolio with truly creative and innovative products, we\u2019ve streamlined and strengthened our operations while adding to the depth of our management talent and we\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to consistently deliver outstanding financial results. ", "We continue to work diligently to translate these accomplishments into increased stockholder value as we move ahead.", "We will now take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Could you give us a quick comment on the inventory levels of Grand Theft Auto IV at retail, are you expecting, it sounds like your guidance might be implying fewer shipments in the fourth quarter then maybe we were expecting and could you just outline your view of where the upside was in the quarter, there was a considerable disconnect on the EPS relative to your guidance and where was the upside relative to your expectations or guidance?", "Strauss Zelnick ", "I think the upside was really across several titles, GTA IV obviously outperformed but Top Spin 3 outperformed especially well in Europe. Carnival Games turned out to be the gift that keeps on giving and since we launched the [inaudible] it\u2019s only improved the value of the franchise in sales of that franchise. Civilization Revolution also outperformed so I think if you look at our release schedule just about all of our titles have outperformed expectations and so I wouldn\u2019t hang too much on GTA IV although obviously that contributed a lot to what\u2019s going on.", "And then finally you also have to look at our cost savings initiatives, I think while we\u2019ll take some cost savings and reinvest it in other parts of the business overall I think we\u2019re operating much more efficiently then we were certainly a year ago and those benefits benefited us during the quarter so all of those factors together contributed to the outperformance of the quarter and obviously we\u2019re very proud of our performance.", "With respect to inventory levels, we don\u2019t disclose inventory levels in the channel. I know there are those that do channel checks, and you can probably get it that way, but we don\u2019t, we\u2019re comfortable where our inventory levels are and we\u2019re comfortable that going into the fall and holiday season that sales of GTA IV will pick up. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Just done some quick math, but it looks like based on the mid point of your new guidance your stock is trading at about 11x, you stripped $440 in cash and trending about 9x, that compares to a market of about 14x in a group, trading on 21x, you ex out yourself, it trading about 24x, so what do you do to get a more adequate multiple for the economics you\u2019re generating and do you think at some level the expired tender from EA is creating a cap to your stock price?", "Strauss Zelnick ", "We really do focus on our [knitting] and it is our belief that\u2019s ultimately markets really do reflect reality and I\u2019ve spoken about this before, the company has a history of having some inconsistency in its results and while when you have the biggest title in the industry and a huge title here you can always expect volatility and of course any [inaudible] has volatility in it. We said we feel it\u2019s really incumbent upon us to build a company that can be profitable year in year out and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate for investors to say, this is great performance and we want to see more of it. ", "So our view is we focus on what we can control which is we\u2019re trying to make and our creative people are trying to make the best products anyone makes in the interactive entertainment business. We\u2019re trying to cover a wide array of genres. We\u2019re trying to distribute them better then anyone else all around the world, ourselves, we\u2019re trying to open new territories and open new channels for our products and make this the most compelling place in the entertainment industry today to work.", "If we achieve all that the results follow and if the results follow the market follows the results. As for the technical calculations, we are all entitled to our own views but we\u2019re not here to argue about what the market says about us. We figure if we keep delivering the market will be there. ", "Benjamin Feder ", "I want to make the point about what\u2019s gone on in the last five quarters here, yes we are in a volatile business and you will expect to see volatility quarter to quarter so we don\u2019t apologize for that because of the nature of the business on the one hand. On the other hand this company has performed and outperformed five quarters in a row so it\u2019s not just what the bottom line is this quarter its consistent performance that is what we aim for. Yes there\u2019ll be volatility from quarter to quarter but these are the kind of results that are new to this company frankly and we\u2019re quite proud of them. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Looking at the benefits you hope to reap from the restructuring efforts specifically on sports since you\u2019ve consolidated some of the studios in the sports franchise which arguably effected quality over some of the titles, do you expect to have a turnaround and reap the benefits in that consolidation both in terms of quality and margins next year or could you see some incremental benefits would be more linear rather then a stair step as you launch the next round of sport sales next year and then on the GTA Chinatown for the DS now that that is in the works you\u2019re working with Nintendo more and more, any opportunities to bring the franchise to the Wii?", "Benjamin Feder ", "With respect to the sports titles, let me be clear, there are some titles that are quite profitable and some titles that are less profitable. The ones that are less profitable tend to be volume dependant which is to say as the installed base grows we expect those to get more profitable and we expect that the install base will grow this Christmas. We are very bullish on this Christmas and Microsoft\u2019s price cut recently I think will help that as well.", "As to your question about margin we expect certainly to improve. The question about quality will also I believe will improve. We have the team onboard is committed to a highly competitive product for next year. We\u2019ve had lots of internal discussions about it. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll deliver a product that\u2019s AAA and is everything that we and the market expect from 2K and [BC] so we\u2019re quite bullish on the sports business understanding the challenges and the structural challenges that we all know are embedded in the business. ", "With respect to GTA Chinatown I will tell you that we\u2019ve spent an enormous amount of time and effort working with Nintendo and developing that partnership. We\u2019re very proud of the partnership that we have to date. We continue to build that relationship. We think we have significant value to add to that partnership and that\u2019s not a one-way relationship in any way. GTA Chinatown Wars is not even the first step but certainly an important step in continuing to develop that relationship. ", "So without commenting on whether GTA specifically whether it is coming to the Wii or not, I will say that Nintendo and Take-Two work very well together. Nintendo and Rockstar are beginning to work well together and we intend to continue to grow that relationship. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "Benjamin Schachter \u2013 UBS", "Can you just confirm have you actually had the review with EA or is that still being scheduled? Going forward when you\u2019re starting to think about your FY09 budgeting process do you think about it as including Rockstar and what would be the magnitude of how those numbers would change if the Rockstar contract were not to be renewed? Could you talk about any new models or new things you\u2019re thinking about for the sports business? ", "Strauss Zelnick ", "We\u2019ve disclosed actually that we\u2019re an NDA vis-a-vie Electronic Arts and there\u2019s nothing else we can say. In terms of your question about our budgeting process, which is a headline for the question about the Rockstar contract negotiations, first of all we never talk about our discussions with individual employees and we never have. I think the answer is we look at this enterprise based on the budgets that are submitted and we want to make sure we\u2019re really comfortable with them going forward and its not related to any individual contract discussions. ", "Benjamin Feder ", "We\u2019re not restructuring the sports business in any way. We think we have the best sports development team on the planet and we have them on, they\u2019re working on some of the more challenging sports titles that we have and so the issues that we have in sports to be clear again, are related to specific areas in the sports business not the entire sports business and in those specific areas the one driver that will improve profitability is the installed base and the size of the market and that in some ways is out of our control. ", "Benjamin Schachter \u2013 UBS", "The question on sports was more if you could elaborate on any new models in terms of online subscribers\u2019 models, those kinds of things going forward?", "Benjamin Feder ", "We are looking at them, and some of them quite seriously, but I have nothing to announce today. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz - Cowen & Company", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Company", "It looks to me like your international numbers have been quite a bit stronger then maybe you had expected at the beginning of the year, can you comment on whether this is primarily a currency effect, is it a function of better unit sales in international markets then you\u2019d expected or something else.", "Strauss Zelnick ", "Traditionally if you net out our sports business which tends to be a domestic business, the number that you see for the quarter are consistent with what that would look like when you net out sports and so what happened in Q3 because GTA is so large, and because of the summer, the size of the sports business over the share of the total business is diminished and so you begin to see a more normalized international versus domestic breakout.", "Benjamin Feder ", "That said we remain focused on building up our international business and making it a bigger percentage. ", "Strauss Zelnick ", "We haven\u2019t talked a lot about our Asian expansion; we have great hopes for it. We\u2019re making a lot of progress and we expect to continue to see progress on the Asian front.  ", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Company", "Could you also confirm it sounded like you were implying this, but is GTA Chinatown Wars scheduled to launch before Christmas. ", "Benjamin Feder ", "No we didn\u2019t say that and we\u2019re not implying that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Looking more towards next year, can you give us an idea as to what the economics will be for the GTA downloadable content at this point? Looking at the Cryptic relationship, are you going to share on the subscription side or is that more the distribution and the concerned packaged goods component? And then what are your thoughts with regards to the MMO space, with regards to Take-Two owned properties and then can you just give us an idea as to what the NOL is at this point?", "Lainie Goldstein ", "For the episodic content question we have not determined the pricing at this time so we don\u2019t have that information for you but we could tell you that we will be pairing our revenue with capitalized software amortization, our internal royalty\u2019s expense and any associated marketing expense for the title. We haven\u2019t disclosed our NOLs on a quarterly basis to date, but you can get a rough estimate by looking at the year end balance in our 10-K and then adjusting it by our nine month cumulative change in our valuation allowance and you can see that, it\u2019ll be disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q that\u2019s scheduled to be filed by tomorrow.", "Benjamin Feder ", "With respect to online and Cryptic specifically, you can imagine the deal with Cryptic is again under confidentiality, we\u2019re not prepared to disclose anything about the economics and any share if any of subscription revenue as opposed to boxed revenue but I will say that we are pleased with the economics of the business, we\u2019re pleased with Cryptic as a partner and we have great hopes and expectations for the title. ", "With respect to MMO and Take-Two owned properties, I think we\u2019ve said publically and certainly privately that the way we think to get into Asia specifically MMO markets is to use our Take-Two owned properties and to partner so that we mitigate the risk and that is our stated strategy. We don\u2019t have anything specifically to announce. I would also say that Cryptic should give you an indication that where we\u2019re seeing opportunity we\u2019ll be opportunistic. We intend to gain institutional knowledge on the MMO market. We think broadband is an important strategic initiative for this company as well as for every company in the industry and any chance that we get to learn and increase our presence profitably we\u2019ll take that opportunity.", "That said we know that we have one of the strongest IP portfolios in the business. We know we\u2019re the envy of many companies, especially in Asia and we will use those brands and very carefully judicially so that we take maximum advantage of them.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler - Lehman Brothers", "Eric Handler - Lehman Brothers", "When you look at the lineup of titles coming out in October, and obviously October is always very crowded, but it actually seems the October 7th release date you had there\u2019s a lot fewer titles in the mix coming out that week relative to the 14th and the 21st, so could you give color around what you saw that you so desired to push the game back two weeks and then given how strong earnings are for this year, I know you\u2019re working on your budgets, but directionally speaking is this the high water mark for earnings until GTA V comes out? ", "Strauss Zelnick ", "We\u2019re going to talk about our guidance when we have it ready. We try very hard to be conservative and realistic. One of the burdens of having beaten our guidance is that people begin to think that you\u2019re always going to beat your guidance and we try to emphasize our goal really is to guide realistically and there\u2019s a lot of emphasis on that now and that\u2019s what we\u2019re waiting for. I wouldn\u2019t arrive at any conclusions yet and we\u2019ll tell you when we know more.", "Benjamin Feder ", "With respect to Midnight Club and your question, I think the folks around here will tell you the number one thing that we\u2019re concerned about all the time is what\u2019s the best thing for the titles. When we look at release dates the answer is always what\u2019s the best thing for the title. Your point about the competitive environment is well taken, but on balance considering all the other aspects that go into the launch of a game, on balance we felt that the right thing to do was to move the release date. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal and we don\u2019t think it will affect sales one way or another given that release. We want to make sure the title is absolutely ready to go and it\u2019s the best that it can be. I\u2019ll tell you that I saw a build of it today and it looks absolutely awesome. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Taylor \u2013 Arcadia Investment Corporation", "John Taylor \u2013 Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Could you give us a sense of what the catalogue was as a percent of published revenue in the third quarter?", "Lainie Goldstein ", "It was 13% this quarter. ", "John Taylor \u2013 Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Specifically what was the GTA franchise as a percent of total published revenue?", "Lainie Goldstein ", "The entire franchise was approximately 60%. ", "John Taylor \u2013 Arcadia Investment Corporation", "You mentioned something about the sales and marketing budget going up to support GTA IV ongoing, is there a way you could characterize for us how you\u2019re going to pace yourself through the total budget, the advertising budget, of GTA IV this year, what percent has been spent already and what percent has been reserved for the holiday timeframe and maybe even put that in the context of your comment about San Andreas doing X number of units in its first year and then why in its second year and how the promotional strategy helps drive demand over the long haul?", "Lainie Goldstein ", "We don\u2019t really provide that level of detail on a title by title basis but I can tell you that we definitely looked at the Christmas season as an opportunity to get back out there and really market the title for new owners of the hardware as they\u2019re buying it during the Christmas season. So we definitely looked at the different timing for us for launching this title in April and then what the marketing would look at different times during the year for the title. ", "John Taylor \u2013 Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Can you give us a sense of whether we\u2019re closer to 50/50, or 70/30 or 80/20 in terms of how much has been reserved for holiday?", "Lainie Goldstein ", "No I can\u2019t really share that, I\u2019m sorry. ", "John Taylor \u2013 Arcadia Investment Corporation", "Of the titles basically scheduled for November and October release are they all pretty much simultaneously releasing across all platforms, have you got all the SKUs together? ", "Benjamin Feder ", "Pretty much. ", "John Taylor \u2013 Arcadia Investment Corporation", "So if we see a little bit of variance a week or two, we shouldn\u2019t draw too much into that?", "Benjamin Feder ", "No. ", "Operator", "Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Just curious on the theatrical side obviously BioShock I think for a couple of years out but you have Max Payne is coming out in October, I believe you own that IP, are you set to generate any sort of economics from the net receipts of that movie at the box office and if you could walk us through a generic model on how that works and them maybe philosophically how you see that as an element of your business moving forward? ", "Strauss Zelnick ", "As it happens Max Payne is a split rights deal and we don\u2019t share meaningfully in the motion picture\u2019s economics so it\u2019s not actually a good model going forward. Our model going forward is that of owning our own intellectual property as you know and trying to make the biggest hits we can in the interactive entertainment space and then very selectively when it makes creative sense for the product when it will enhance the quality of the brand and when we have sufficient creative control to mitigate the risk, there are a lot of ifs built in there, we\u2019ll selectively look at other markets and other media. ", "The reason that we were willing to turn BioShock into a movie is because we\u2019re able to align ourselves with an A plus creative team, [Gord Rubinski and John Logan] and an A plus studio, Universal Pictures, with a burning desire to make a movie that will stand on its own and be terrific and that\u2019s what we think is going to happen and we feel terrifically good about it. What we\u2019re not going to do is make empty announcements about development deals that don\u2019t lead to motion pictures and what we\u2019re certainly not going to do is compromise the quality of the extraordinary work our creative people do or in any way diminish their creative enterprise or motivation by treating interactive entertainment properties like Reece\u2019s Cups, as much as I love a good Reece\u2019s Cup now and then. That\u2019s the focus; we\u2019re going to be awfully selective. ", "Additionally and it has to be said because we are in the business of business as well, when we do take something to another medium we expect to be able to make a whole lot of money doing it. But this is all in the future now, it\u2019s not in our numbers currently so stay tuned. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "On the downloadable content for GTA IV and how we think about your efforts in trying to remarket that game to the holiday period, is there a reason why strategically it would make sense to have the first downloadable release after the holiday period?", "Strauss Zelnick ", "I think Ben answered it well before which is we really are focused on making extraordinary entertainment around here and we\u2019re not cavalier at all about our need and desire to manage a company that is routinely profitable because we\u2019re in a growth business with good economics. That said, when you start getting into individual release dates you\u2019re always going to get the same answer which is we are driven primarily with making the best products out and its not just a creative desire, it\u2019s the right thing for business too because as this business matures, and you know how much investment is going on out there, you know how robust a business is, you know how much attention it gets, as a business matures a lot of people start throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks. ", "Since we got here, we\u2019ve diversified a product base but we said we would focus on a selective number of superb titles across all genres and that\u2019s our goal. So think about it, we\u2019re now taking our number one franchise, and the industry\u2019s number one franchise and we\u2019re delving into an unchartered area which is episodic content. We need to make sure that consumers are absolutely thrilled and delighted by what they see and if it needs to be said, we and the Rockstar team see exactly eye to eye on this as we do on nearly everything. ", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time; I would like to turn it back to management for any additional or closing remarks. ", "Strauss Zelnick ", "Thanks so much. It\u2019s always a pleasure to share good news and thanks for joining us. ", "Benjamin Feder ", "I do want; it\u2019s been such a spectacular quarter I really do want to thank the team at Take-Two and our studios and at corporate. None of it could have been done without the extraordinary efforts of the very talented people in this organization in a period of time where we could have been completely distracted, everybody kept their head down and delivered some fine results for the company. I\u2019m very proud of their work and I just wanted to mention them on the call. Thank you very much. ", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Cindy Buckwalter, Executive Vice President for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you, Ms. Buckwalter. You may begin. ", "Cindy Buckwalter", "Thank you. Welcome and thank you all for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call. Today\u2019s call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Chairman of Take-Two; Ben Feder, our CEO; and Lainie Goldstein, our CFO. Our team will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. ", "Before we begin, I would first like to quickly review our Safe Harbor statement by reminding everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our press release today and our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007 and our 10-Q for the interim quarters of fiscal 2008. These documents may be obtained from our website at www.taketwogames.com. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. Today we\u2019ll review our financial results for the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll discuss our strategic roadmap, our product lineup, and initial guidance for the coming year. We\u2019ll provide our insights on the economic environment and explain our belief that we\u2019ll well-positioned in these clearly uncertain and challenging times. ", "I am pleased to announced that Take-Two once again achieved its guidance for the fourth quarter. For the full year, we delivered the strongest revenue and earnings in the company\u2019s history. Our record fiscal 2008 results were driven by the phenomenal success of GTA 4 from Rockstar Games. Other top titles for us this year were Midnight Club Los Angeles, NBA 2K9, Carnival Games, Grand Theft Auto catalog titles, and Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization Revolution. ", "These strong results reflected the actions we began taking in early 2007 to transform our business. Our initiatives included a sharper and more disciplined focus on building our portfolio of world-class titles, the divestiture or revitalization of non-core businesses, and continued emphasis on becoming more efficient and more cost-effective. ", "I would really like to highlight today\u2019s announcement that we have entered into new long-term agreements with Rockstar Games\u2019 Sam Hauser, Dan Hauser, and Leslie Benzies, as well as several key additional members of the creative team behind our largest selling franchise, Grand Theft Auto. We are thrilled to begin this new chapter in our successful relationship with Rockstar. This team has been instrumental in the development and success of many of our multi-million unit internally owned franchises. In addition to Grand Theft Auto, they include Midnight Club, Bully, Max Payne, Red Dead Revolver, and Manhunt. Rockstar's talent and creativity are unparalleled in our industry. ", "We\u2019ve established a new incentive compensation program for the Rockstar Games label that is primarily based on a profit-sharing structure across the entire organization. And we\u2019ve instituted a broad-based long-term equity compensation program as well, including a restricted stock that vests over the term of the agreement. We believe this new partnership meaningfully aligns the interest of our creative teams with those of our stockholders. ", "Now I would like to offer our perspective on the holiday season and beyond. We\u2019ve always said that entertainment isn't immune to economic downturns and these times are certainly both volatile and challenging. I would describe the prevailing trends for our industry as mixed. ", "Now, the good news is that videogames continue to be highly sought after gifts this season. Triple A products remain high on consumer\u2019s wish lists and many people believe that these games provide greater entertainment value than other forms of entertainment. ", "While we\u2019ve seen some holiday promotional pricing, our belief is that Triple A product pricing will largely continue to hold through the holidays and beyond, and many retailers have reported stronger sales for interactive entertainment products in contrast to other categories. ", "That said, it\u2019s important to remember that consumers of interactive entertainment are as much affected by the economy as our other shoppers, and while Walmart and other discounters have remained relatively strong, the bankruptcy filings of Circuit City in the U.S. and Woolworth\u2019s in the U.K. have contributed to an uncertain atmosphere. In short, broad softness at retail has and probably will continue to have an impact on our industry. ", "This softness has affected many of our peers and we too are experiencing lower-than-expected overall holiday sales. The outlook for the economy is vastly different today than anyone might have expected this past summer, or even as recently as 45 days ago. So we\u2019ve taken a harder look at our forecast for the next 12 months and we\u2019ve significantly reduced our expectations. As I\u2019ve said before, we see it as our obligation to operate the company profitably on a non-GAAP basis even in a year without a major new GTA release. The initial guidance we are providing today reflects that. Lainie will provide further details on the first quarter and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2009. ", "Taking all these factors into account, we\u2019ve adopted what we believe is a prudent outlook for this fiscal year. It\u2019s important to be clear that we believe we are extremely well-positioned in all facets of our business to navigate these challenging times and we will continue to aspire to be at the forefront of our industry. ", "Now I will turn the call over to Ben who will provide more detail about our fourth quarter results, our operations, products, and our strategic roadmap for the coming year. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Thanks, Strauss. I am pleased to announce that we have an extraordinary performance in fiscal 2008. For the year, we recorded record results, $1.5 billion in revenue with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.08. We ended the year with $280 million in cash and our cash net of debt was $210 million. ", "Our fourth quarter results were in line with our guidance. Sales were led by Midnight Club Los Angeles, NBA 2K9, Grand Theft Auto 4, and Carnival Games. Net revenue for the quarter was $323.4 million, compared with $292.6 million for Q4 last year. Earnings on a non-GAAP basis were $0.02 per share, compared with $0.05 per share for the same quarter a year ago. Our Q4 results were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates, which Lainie will discuss later in the call. ", "Looking to Q1, we are only about halfway through the quarter but our results will be affected by the challenging retail environment and a slower-than-expected start for Midnight Club Los Angeles. We still believe that Midnight Club Los Angeles will perform well over time as the prior Midnight Club titles have historically enjoyed a long tail in the market. And while Grand Theft Auto 4 has done phenomenally well and exceeded our expectations this year, it\u2019s strongest sales came earlier in the year than we had expected. Additionally, the first downloadable episode for GTA 4 and Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars are now scheduled for release in Q2. Lainie will provide further details about the quarter. ", "We are operating today in an environment of great uncertainty. We are keenly focused on a number of actions that will position the company to deliver the strongest possible performance in these challenging times, while continuing to scale our business for profitable growth in the future. ", "Beyond the purely economic factors, success in our industry is driven by hit products and our creativity and owned IP drives Take-Two. We are maintaining our focus on creating the most innovative triple A games in the industry today and are committed to nurturing the talent of our 1,500 developers across 15 studios who continue to set new benchmarks in videogames. ", "You can see our commitment to excellence in the ratings. From the calendar year through November 2008, the average metacritic rating for our product was 80%. That\u2019s higher than any other third party publisher. ", "In keeping with our strategy of releasing a select number of top tier games, many of which are internally owned and developed, we are very pleased with our solid roster of high quality titles in the pipeline for 2009. The first downloadable episode for GTA 4 for Xbox Live, Grand Theft Auto 4 The Lost and the Damned, will be available on February 17th. The trailer had its debut at the Spike TV videogame awards last Sunday. It looks fantastic and delivers an incredible and entirely new experience in Liberty City. ", "I would like to take a moment to pause and congratulate the entire Grand Theft Auto 4 team for winning Spike TV\u2019s 2008 videogame of the year award this last Sunday. Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars will be coming to Nintendo DS on March 17th, marking the first time that the world\u2019s largest videogame franchise will meet the current gen\u2019s largest installed base. ", "Rockstar will offer a South Central upgrade map and content pack, its first downloadable content for Midnight Club Los Angeles in early 2009 for both Xbox 360 and PS3. ", "Rockstar is scheduled to release Speed Raider in mid-2009 and Rockstar has one triple A title currently under development planned for the release in fiscal 2009. ", "2K will release Borderlands, an exciting new sci-fi franchise from acclaimed developer Gear Box, combining first person shooter game play, RPG character progression, and an array of weaponry, Borderlands is poised to deliver an incredible videogame experience. ", "2K Games will release Bioshock 2. The original Bioshock won last year\u2019s Spike TV Game of the Year Award and is the second-highest rated title on Xbox 360 and the second-highest rated third-party title on the PS3, according to metacritic. ", "Mafia 2, the sequel to our 2 million unit selling hit, is due out from 2K next year. The new Mafia 2 trailer had its worldwide premiere during last Sunday\u2019s Spike TV videogame awards and once again the team has done an exceptional job in capturing all the nuances of this genre. ", "Our 2K sports franchises are the quality leaders. NBA 2K9 is the top rated and top-selling basketball game in this console\u2019s cycle, continuing a track record that has made the NBA 2K franchise the top-ranked NBA title for the past eight years. We remain confident that we can build on this solid platform of quality titles to achieve scale in our sports business. This year from 2K sports, we\u2019ll release MLB Front Office Manager, Major League Baseball 2K9, NHL 2K10, and NBA 2K10. And this year\u2019s lineup will include additional titles from Major League Baseball. ", "We will grow our family entertainment portfolio with the launch of seven new titles from 2K Play. We are excited to be expanding on our successful relationship with Nickelodeon by releasing a new slate of products, including the new Dora the Explorer titles and two soon-to-be-announced properties. And our Cat Daddy Studios, the talent behind our Carnival Games franchise, will deliver two exciting new properties that are poised to strengthen our position in the family entertainment category. Carnival Games has been a tremendous success, having sold over 3 million units, and the brand continues to experience strong sales. ", "One change to note in our 2009 pipeline as a result of Atari\u2019s recent acquisition of Cryptic Studios, we no longer intend to publish the MMO game Champions Online. ", "I would like now to discuss several measures we are taking in response to the present economic challenges. While we\u2019ve benefited for the significant cost savings initiatives that we began to implement in 2007, we are continuing to look at the company\u2019s expense structure. Although we don\u2019t anticipate the need for any additional dramatic cost initiatives, given that we\u2019ve already taken substantial costs out of the business, we continue to explore areas where we could derive additional benefits. That said, we are continuing to invest in the growth of our creative resources. While other publishers are closing studios, we view this as an opportunity to acquire strong talent and are selectively hiring additionally highly talented developers. ", "We\u2019ve taken steps to maintain our access to the credit market, given the current constraints on credit worldwide. Shortly after our management team joined Take-Two last year, we obtained a credit facility that would provide us with additional flexibility in running our business as needed. Given the current market conditions, we were fortunate to have our facility already in place and available to us.  As a matter of prudence, as of October 31st, we drew down $70 million on this facility to fund our working capital needs for this holiday season and beyond.  ", "Our lending group has been incredibly supportive. We very much appreciate their confidence in our team and our business. ", "We are continuing to focus on many opportunities on the horizon on which we can capitalize to broaden our offering and diversify our revenues. We believe that downloadable content is a significant opportunity in the near-term. We are excited about the creative opportunity and profit potential of this new distribution channel. We are innovating with episodes for Grand Theft Auto 4 and we are looking across our entire portfolio to see where else this makes sense for our brands. ", "Network game play is another important means of maximizing the value of our strong intellectual property. It also helps address some of the concerns that we have with respect to sales of used products. ", "There is the potential for micro transactions and subscriptions to enhance the packaged goods business by offering multiple revenue channels as other media companies have successfully done, and we are seeing emerging opportunities with the iPhone. ", "We believe we will continue to benefit from the growing installed base of the Nintendo Wii. Our relationship with Nintendo has never been stronger and the success of Carnival Games franchise gives us a great foundation upon which to build. ", "Our strategy of selectively developing triple A titles extends to our approach to our family entertainment portfolio. We will continue to focus on developing a limited number of titles that have high potential for success. Carnival Games is a perfect example of that strategy, yielding incredible results. ", "We are expanding our presence in emerging markets. These could well be the first economies to recover from a worldwide recession. We opened an office in Asia earlier this year and believe that we are now in a much stronger position to capitalize on the opportunity. Our world-renowned content will help drive our expansion into that region. Operating in Asia will be particularly important as we explore opportunities in micro-transactions and subscriptions. ", "We will further leverage our strong catalog business, which can generate up to 30% of our revenue. One of the benefits of having Triple A products is that over time, they become valuable drivers of our catalog. If as some believe this current console cycle lasts longer than originally expected, our catalog could be much more valuable over time. ", "Lastly, there are opportunities to extend our franchises into traditional media, including TV, film, and music. ", "To summarize, while we recognize the potential economic challenges that our industry and company face, we remain steadfast in our determination to deliver value by being the most innovative, most creative, and the most efficient company in the interactive entertainment industry. We have a strategic roadmap that we believe will build upon our success. We will continue to transform this company and expand our global leadership, including creating original IP and triple A games, offering the best home for and partner to the top creative talent, and setting new benchmarks for quality and innovation, deriving ongoing benefits from our completed revitalization plan and maximizing our cost savings and efficiencies going forward, prudently expanding our international presence in emerging markets, especially Asia, increasing the scale of our business through opportunistic but selective M&A, and exploiting new revenue and growth opportunities, including leveraging our catalog. ", "With that, I thank you and I would like to turn the call over to Lainie. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Ben and good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our fourth quarter results and then discuss our outlook for Q1 and fiscal 2009. Net revenue was $323 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $293 million a year ago. Non-GAAP net income was $1.6 million, compared to non-GAAP net income of $3.4 million last year. The non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.02 compared to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05 last year. Our press release provides a complete reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers. ", "Affecting our Q4 results was approximately a $7.7 million negative impact to net income, or $0.10 per share, for foreign exchange rates as compared to our guidance. We are pleased to report that this is the sixth quarter in a row that we have met or exceeded our guidance. This quarter\u2019s results were led by Midnight Club Los Angeles, NBA 2K9, Grand Theft Auto 4, and Carnival Games. Jack of all Games business also grew year over year, primarily driven by strong current generation hardware sales and demand for Wii products. ", "Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter were a net loss of approximately $50 million or $0.20 per share, compared with a net loss of $7 million or $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Our GAAP results included $9.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and a total of $7.2 million of professional fees and expenses related to unusual legal matters, as well as business reorganization costs. In looking at our consolidated results, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 31%, flat with last year. Our Q4 revenue mix was also comparable to last year, with publishing at 75% of total revenue. ", "Our split between North America and international revenue was 65% to 35% in Q4, compared to 74% to 26% in Q4 of last year. Excluding our sports and distribution businesses, our North America/international revenue split for the quarter was about 45% to 55% compared to 60% to 40% last year. This is consistent with our strategy to grow our international business. ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately $99 million, up from last year\u2019s fourth quarter for the following reasons: sales and marketing expenses accounted for the largest increase, primarily due to advertising for Midnight Club Los Angeles and Grand Theft Auto 4. R&D expenses increased with a continued investment in our development studios, including the three additional studios we\u2019ve opened or acquired this year, 2K Tech, 2K Marin, and Rockstar New England. Also, G&A expenses increased slightly compared to last year, due primarily to increased professional fees and the G&A costs related to our three new development studios and our newly established Asian operation. These increases were partially offset by approximately $2 million of cost savings initiatives. ", "Please note that we are now including our foreign exchange gains and losses in our interest and other income expense line. We have previously included this in our G&A expenses. We had $4.3 million in foreign exchange loss in Q4, which is included in that line item. ", "We incurred a taxable loss during the fourth quarter which partially offset the prior quarter\u2019s profits, resulting in a fourth quarter tax benefit. ", "Moving on to our balance sheet, at the end of Q4 we had $280 million in cash, including $70 million from borrowings on our credit line. Cash was used in the quarter for inventory purchases, product manufacturing costs, and advertising in advance of the holiday season, as well as internal royalties for titles that had shipped earlier in the year. ", "Our accounts receivable reserve was about $68 million at the end of the quarter, which represented approximately 30% of gross receivables. Inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately $104 million, up slightly from this time last year, primarily due to many of our new releases shipping late in the quarter this year and also Jack\u2019s increased level of hardware business compared to last year. ", "While software development costs and licenses were flat year over year, we amortized a significant amount of software development costs during the year as a result of our key releases in 2008. At the same time, we continue to invest in future products. We currently have 36 titles in various stages of development. ", "Now to our outlook -- we are issuing initial guidance today for fiscal 2009. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of break-even to $0.20 from $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion in revenue. This excludes stock-based compensation expense of $0.52 per share and expenses related to unusual legal matters of $0.05 per share. ", "I would like to offer some important comments around the initial guidance we are providing today. Given the challenging economic environment that we expect could continue well into 2009, we took a very hard look at our unit assumptions across all titles and adjusted them accordingly. We cannot predict how long the current economic conditions will last, or how significantly it will impact our business over the next 12 months. And while we continue to be diligent in working to protect our business [in advance] with regard to potential bad debt exposure, and have had no material impact many of the retailer bankruptcies to date, it may be difficult to completely eliminate that exposure. ", "I will provide more detail later in the call on the timing of our [key] products in 2009. It\u2019s important to note that our release schedule is very heavily back-end loaded, with many of our key triple A titles planned for release in Q4. Maintaining our release schedule is very critical to our fiscal year results. ", "Another area of variability in our results comes from foreign exchange rates, which have been very volatile in the past couple of months. For the purposes of guidance, we assume flat rates as of the time we finalized our forecasts. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro and pound, we may have downside EPS exposure. ", "Let me provide some more specific data points on our 2009 outlook. We expect our total revenue mix to be at 80% from publishing and 20% from distribution. On a blended basis for publishing and distribution, we expect gross margins for fiscal 2009 to be in the low 30s. This is down from fiscal 2008, primarily due to the strong contribution of Grand Theft Auto 4 in 2008. We expect our split between North America and international revenue to be about 75% to 25%. Excluding our sports and distribution business, our North America/international split is expected to be approximately 55% to 45%. ", "Within publishing, we expect the relative revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 45% from Rockstar and 55% from 2K.

Note that our operating expense and tax guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We see 2009 G&A levels improving by approximately 10% in absolute dollars compared to 2008, based on our cost-cutting initiatives and reduced personnel expenses following our restructuring. The change in foreign exchange rates is also expected to have a positive impact on G&A expenses of approximately $6 million compared to 2008. ", "Additionally, we are forecasting a decrease in professional fees as we expect to resolve some of our outstanding regulatory issues.

The change in foreign exchange rates is expected to have a positive impact on sales and marketing expenses of approximately $3 million, although this could be offset by costs related to our expansion efforts in Asia. R&D will grow slightly due to the continued investment in our development studios and the full-year cost of our new studios.

We expect a non-GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.70 to $0.85, on $175 million to $225 million in revenue. This excludes stock-based compensation expense of $0.14 per share, and expenses related to unusual legal matters of $0.01. ", "Let me provide some additional data points on our Q1 outlook. We expect our revenue mix to be about 55% from publishing and 45% from distribution, due to the seasonal ramp-up in Jack\u2019s business, and the increased demands they are seeing for current gen hardware and software.

We expect continued sales of titles released in prior quarters, including Midnight Club Los Angeles, NBA 2K9, GTA 4, and our Carnival Game title. ", "We expect reduced gross profit margins in Q1 compared to last year. They will likely be in the high teens. This is primarily due to higher promotional and co-op spending this year. Also, much of our Q1 publishing business last year was from older catalog titles where the [inaudible] software had already been fully amortized. We expect gross margins to trend back up in Q2 with the release of the Lost and Damned, the first episode of Grand Theft Auto 4, as well as Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars for the DS. ", "We expect overall operating expenses to trend down a bit in Q1 as compared to Q4, primarily driven by reductions in G&A from our cost-cutting initiatives and the positive impact from foreign exchange rates. However, R&D expenses are expected to increase in Q1 as compared to Q4 due to lower software capitalization rates during the holiday season and from incremental IT spending.

", "Eric Handler - Barclay\u2019s Capital ", "Thank you very much for taking my question. With regard to the Rockstar talent announcement, in the release you say they are going to be essentially carving out a separate studio which you will release some of their titles. What percentage of the new content from Rockstar going forward is going to be owned by the new studio versus what you own?", "Strauss Zelnick", "First of all, I would like to emphasize that the key elements here in this deal are a continued relationship with the top talent in the business. The second point to emphasize is that we\u2019ve announced that the economic incentives related to that extension are based on a profit-sharing arrangement. That\u2019s new, that\u2019s change and a reflection of our continued strategy and approach to make sure the interests of everyone who works at Take-Two are aligned with the interests of our shareholders and we are really pleased and proud that our entire team is up for that and excited about that. It obviously will emphasize the focus on profitability around here and that\u2019s what we are aiming to do with our creative talent, with our executive talent, with everyone we are in business with. ", "On the specific question you posed, in addition to looking after existing properties and new properties that are wholly-owned by our company, there is an entrepreneurial opportunity for the key talent with whom we have a relationship with at Rockstar to develop new incremental intellectual property that they own and will be exclusively published by Take-Two. ", "In terms of the actual number of properties, it\u2019s not really possible to say at this point. I think the key point is that more triple A products in which we have an interest, that we exclusively publish, the better it is for our company. The more entrepreneurial and creative opportunity for our key talent and colleagues at Rockstar Games, the better it is for the company. We think it\u2019s a win-win.

We\u2019re curious what would happen to the contract if there was a change of control, and then I have a follow-up. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Mike, thanks for your comments. We don\u2019t ever give that kind of detail. You know, apart from saying that we\u2019re very focused on managing the company as responsibly as possible and frankly, we\u2019re very proud of having done that in the past. That\u2019s how we expect to operate going forward. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay. And then obviously fiscal \u201909 is difficult -- I\u2019m guessing a lot of that is macro. Can you talk at all about fiscal \u201910 and give us a reason to get excited here?", "Strauss Zelnick", "You know, we\u2019re obviously not giving guidance for fiscal \u201910. Moreover, I think we\u2019re trying to emphasize that these times are indeed very uncertain. Without trying to sugarcoat the story, because it\u2019s not our nature, we feel really good about the position we\u2019re in. This new management team has been here for all of 18 months and one of the things we said in the release here where we don\u2019t have an all-together new GTA title, we would like to deliver a company that despite the volatility of the industry can be profitable and our guidance reflects an opportunity to be at least break-even. That\u2019s what we are saying and we are trying to do so prudently and responsibly. ", "But I defy anyone to call 2010 very focused, you know, in a very focused or a very accurate way. So right now, we are focused on -- absolutely focused on our long-term strategy. We\u2019ve outlined it but in terms of execution, 2009 -- there\u2019s a lot going on and we are going to focus on executing against that. And as I said, given the times, we feel pretty good about it. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay. I wasn\u2019t actually asking for specific guidance for fiscal \u201910 -- just I mean, some titles from Rockstar that we\u2019ve heard about for a long time -- Max Payne, Red Dead Revolver, the next Grand Theft Auto, [inaudible], can we expect that those games will be out fiscal \u201910?", "Strauss Zelnick", "You know, we\u2019re not going to outline the release schedule. I believe that we are continuing to build the business across all of our labels very, very effectively and I feel good about that sitting here today in 2008, heading into 2009.

", "Benjamin Feder", "Mike, I think it\u2019s also, you know, when it comes to GTA in 2010, it\u2019s really just way too early to talk about it. We\u2019re still selling GTA 4 at full price at retail. We\u2019ve got downloadable episodes coming. We\u2019ve got Chinatown Wars coming -- it\u2019s simply just -- you know, nobody\u2019s saying no but it\u2019s just way too early to talk about 2010 and specifically GTA in 2010.

", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Schachter with UBS.", "Benjamin Schachter - UBS", "-- Rockstar the only one on cash. On the Rockstar deal, you mentioned it was profit share instead of the rev share -- is that profit share on Take-Two or profit share on the Rockstar titles? And then you also talked about equity -- the equity that they are getting, is that going to be -- is that going to be based on performance or is there sort of a set number there? And then in terms of cash, any thoughts on cash burn in 2009? And what percentage of your cash is in the U.S.? Thanks. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, in order, first of all, it\u2019s profit participation based on label results, obviously because that\u2019s what they can control. On the equity side, let me just emphasize that the bulk of the economics are related to a profit participation and the equity is restricted stock grant that vests over the period of the new agreement. Beyond that, we are not prepared to comment. ", "In terms of international versus domestic, Lainie. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "It\u2019s about 70% in the U.S. and 30% in international.

", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Gikas with Piper Jaffray.", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions -- with the external studio, now that some of the Rockstar guys are forming, is it safe to say that that involves like Sam and Dan or Leslie, some of the key players? And then, are their employment contracts, are they now subcontractors of Take-Two working on one or two projects internally but they are now external employees I guess, or subcontractors, not actual employees of the company? How does that stand at this point?", "Strauss Zelnick", "You know, let\u2019s be clear -- these agreements are similar in character in terms of employment as before. No, nothing\u2019s changing in the way that you outlined. They work for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Take-Two. That\u2019s not changing, so certainly nothing like an independent contractor status or the like. And the bulk of their activities is related to what they have done before. There\u2019s an additional opportunity to create intellectual property that will be owned by the key members of the team and published exclusively by Take-Two. Let\u2019s not put the cart before the horse. You know, the key activity is the ongoing activity and these are immensely creative people and we\u2019ve I believe successfully aligned interest and created an opportunity to create more hit titles and that will benefit Take-Two and I also very much hope and expect it will benefit the creative people who are allied to Take-Two. That\u2019s a win-win and that\u2019s a business we try to be in at all times. ", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Is it the key players at Rockstar like Sam, Dan, or Leslie that have formed this external studio?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We\u2019re talking about something to happen in the future. It remains to be seen. This is an opportunity that the key players with whom we are in business here, and that would be indeed Sam, Dan, and Les, have an opportunity to develop some new intellectual property that\u2019s owned outside on an entrepreneurial basis and published exclusively by us. But you know, at the risk of begging your question, this is not a primary activity. This is a secondary activity and there\u2019s no new -- there\u2019s no ribbon-cutting going on for new offices. ", "Anthony Gikas - Piper Jaffray", "Got it. Okay, and then just my last question, you did make some comments on current holiday sales but maybe you could just characterize a little bit more specifically what you are seeing at retail right now -- is the month of December progressing much more challenging than you expected or in line with kind of how you expected, which was say mid-single-digit growth, or what are you expecting for the month of December?", "Strauss Zelnick", "December is actually shaping up okay so far. I mean, bear in mind that we are running up to Christmas now and so it\u2019s day by day. I think that some of our -- Midnight Club we think will have kind of a longer sales cycle than just Christmas and GTA I think is performing okay. I think it will also have longer legs than just Christmas. So I think December is kind of doing okay. It\u2019s not nothing to [inaudible] but it\u2019s doing okay.

And for the full year, it was $710 million of net revenue, which is about 60% of our publishing sales. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "Okay, great. And since you are on, Lainie, let me try this one again -- I think I\u2019ve asked this a couple of times -- so now we are looking at a launch date, a firm launch date for the first episode of GTA. Could you give us a rough kind of margin picture on how that\u2019s going to come into the P&L? I gather there\u2019s not going to be much of a cash impact but I\u2019m wondering kind of what you are going to bring in and what the charges against the revenue are going to look like?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We still haven\u2019t shared the pricing information to date, J.T., so we really haven\u2019t -- I can\u2019t give you the specific numbers but as we recognize the revenue, we will have capitalized software amortization, internal royalties, and the margin, and then we\u2019ll have marketing expense and then the revenue will be recognized net of any royalties that are paid to Microsoft. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "Okay, so can you give us a range in terms of operating margin contribution, anything like that? ", "Lainie Goldstein", "No, we haven\u2019t shared that to date, not yet.

", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "Let\u2019s see -- I guess a lot of questions have been about the contract, so let me try it this way -- from the outside, how is the new contract likely to impact the contribution margin from Rockstar to, you know, as reported on an operating basis for Take-Two? Can you give us a sense of how many basis points up or down or whatever?", "Benjamin Feder", "Actually, we don\u2019t break out operating margin by label or by product, as you know. We talk about our gross margin group-wide. I think the key point here is incentives are aligned and so everyone is in lock-step to try to increase our revenue and do so at the most efficient cost base. And we do expect good things to come out of that and by good things, do I think our margins could go up? They absolutely could go up but we don\u2019t break it out by label. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "Okay, and then you specify that Take-Two is going to own the -- basically own the publishing rights. What happens if this new studio does something that has a direct-to-consumer kind of model without a box on shelf? What role does Take-Two play in that?", "Benjamin Feder", "Again, I would rather not overstate the case. The answer is we would still publish it, wouldn\u2019t change anything and the economics to us would be similar. But again, I think it\u2019s sort of tail-wagging dog time. The key focus is, on a going forward basis, is just as it\u2019s been before. ", "John Taylor - Arcadia ", "Okay. Last question, then Ben, I think in your remarks, you mentioned kind of taking a haircut on unit assumptions across the board, given economic outlook and so on. Could you give us kind of a -- from 30,000 feet, roughly how much you took off the average 10%, 20%, whatever?", "Benjamin Feder", "We took off about 20%, 25%.

Could you talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening with Midnight Club and why you think it may have sold a little softer? Would you attribute it to the competitive release schedule? Do you think it\u2019s the economy? Do you think it\u2019s potentially something with the racing genre? Thanks.

Need for Speed certainly scored a lot lower as a game than Midnight Club did and Need for Speed, just kind of look at week-to-week sales as it comes out. I think we\u2019ve done very, very well. You\u2019ve got to bear in mind that Midnight Club is not [inaudible] like Need for Speed is. It doesn\u2019t have the kind of brand recognition that Need for Speed has and so -- would I like it to be better? Yes, I would. Do I think this title has a lot longer legs than any of our other titles? Absolutely. This title will sell for a long time to come. It\u2019s my not only hope but it\u2019s my belief, and so I\u2019m not -- I\u2019m somewhat disappointed but I\u2019m not terribly disappointed. I\u2019m not terribly concerned.

Can you give us a sense -- you talked about the adjustments that you made to your forecast for next year because of the economy. Could you give us a sense of what those forecasts would look like were we in a more normal operating environment?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Better -- they\u2019d look better. At the risk of -- I\u2019m sorry, because it\u2019s -- it was just too tempting to resist. We pride ourselves on the fact that for six quarters since we\u2019ve been here, we have met or exceeded guidance. We try -- we do that by taking the best look at our release schedule, our cost of doing business, and our opportunities and assessing that in the context of the marketplace and that\u2019s what we tried to do here.

But it\u2019s not -- we didn\u2019t just do an across-the-board change and we tried to be meticulous on a bottoms-up basis, and then we guided as well as we possibly could.

Next Christmas is something we have our eye on and we just -- it\u2019s just -- you just can\u2019t call where the consumer is going to be. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Right, but we are -- I think what we want to emphasize is first of all, having only been at this table for still a relatively short period of time, we are very pleased with the way the company has been transformed into a company that in a very difficult economic time, entering -- really entering a very difficult economic time, we have a very sound financial condition. We\u2019ve got a terrific line-up. We\u2019ve got superb creative talent and they are -- they are with us for the future. We have the highest rated games in the business. Can\u2019t say much more than that, and we believe that to the extent there\u2019s a storm there, we will weather it well.

", "Benjamin Feder", "You know, we\u2019ve got the right strategy for this environment -- a limited number of releases, focusing on the high quality, focus on the products with the most potential, rather than kind of flooding the marketplace with all sorts of product, I think is the right strategy generally but specifically in this economy, and then separately having the resources to pounce on opportunities when they emerge because we believe they will emerge, having imagined what the landscape will look like when we come out of this and making sure that we have competitive advantage and the right assets to take advantage and be a leader when the economy comes out of this is really important to us. ", "So we\u2019ll be focused on [inaudible] our resources, we\u2019ll be focused on conserving cash, and we\u2019ll be focused on a limited number of releases with the highest potential. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "And just to encapsulate our typical way of looking at the world, our typical way of looking at the world is prepare for the worst, hope for the best and this is not a moment for heroics. This is a moment for judicious behavior. ", "Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets", "Yep, no, understandable -- on the deal, to what extent do you guys see this being the model for, or a model that you would like to move to with your other tier one studios, or is this something that you want to try and silo within the Rockstar team?", "Strauss Zelnick", "I think the -- what I would like to emphasize is when we came to the company, we talked about aligning interests and in fact, we spent a good deal of time and effort making sure that executive compensation, that is for executives who aren\u2019t in the creative side of the business, to make sure their incentives were aligned and formulaically so, so as the company performs better, our colleagues and we perform better and enjoy better results. And it was important to extend that to the creative side of the house as well, and what\u2019s great is that people\u2019s economic consensus do translate into behavior. That\u2019s my view of the world, and when people are on a simple, level playing field where everything that one does that achieves a result is either good or bad for everyone, and more or less in the same way, that\u2019s a really great benefit. Among other things, you don\u2019t find yourself talking at cross purposes. You find yourself agreeing on strategy and approach. And we are big believers in that. ", "That said, no, I don\u2019t want to overstate the case because the people who are the top, undoubtedly, unequivocally the top talent in the industry obviously are entitled to top situations economically and you don\u2019t seek to replicate those across the board anymore than you compress the salary structure across the board for corporate executives. So it\u2019s also terribly important that the groups that perform best do best, the individuals who perform best do best, and that overall the company\u2019s incentives, the human incentives, and the stockholders\u2019 goals are all aligned. That\u2019s what we are trying to do here and I can\u2019t tell you how pleased we are that we\u2019ve been able to do that while retaining, encouraging I hope leading the top talent in the industry, to do that all at the same time makes us feel really great and very well-positioned.

You guys mentioned Atari\u2019s acquisition of Cryptic and your subsequent announcement to not publish Champions Online.

This has been a [inaudible] a publisher and not much more than a publisher of the game. MMOs typically is a great opportunity in Asia and this was primarily a U.S.-oriented type of game, if you looked at the content, it was a U.S.-oriented type of game. For a number of reasons that I would prefer not to go into, it became less attractive over time and when Atari bought the company, it became important and critical that we just -- you know, we announced our intention not to distribute the game.

This is our first guidance for 2009 and we\u2019ve met or exceeded guidance historically in terms of our operating results, we\u2019ve met or exceeded guidance the last six quarters that we have been here, and so I want to be careful about guidance versus missing guidance or -- you know, we don\u2019t have an obligation to meet the guidance that analysts set for us. We have an obligation to -- an obligation but we think -- we believe it\u2019s our responsibility to inform shareholders where we think the business is going and that\u2019s what we are doing.

Some of our best content really isn't appropriate for the Wii but that said, Carnival Games has been a massive success for the company and we are looking at in a [disciplined] way, extending that brand to other areas and our -- as I said, our sports -- all of our sports titles are looking at the Wii as a potential platform. And frankly, even at the content that -- the M-rated content that we think is much more appropriate for the PS3 to 360, you know, we have to look at the Wii as a viable platform across all of our labels. We just have to because we can\u2019t ignore the installed base. We just can\u2019t. And we are going to do a lot of learning with GTA 4 -- GTA Chinatown Wars, excuse me, on the DS in terms of bringing that kind of content to a Nintendo platform. You know, our partnership with Nintendo is as strong as its ever been. We\u2019re really excited about it. We talk to them all the time. They provide great feedback for us and we are highly, highly focused on it. That said, I think you see in our release schedule those titles that we\u2019ve announced for 2009. ", "Tom Andrews - BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks, and maybe just one last thing is when you look at the upcoming year or fiscal \u201909, what kind of a revenue contribution do you think we could expect to see from downloadable content this year and what portion of that do you think might be from Grand Theft Auto?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We don\u2019t break that out. ", "Tom Andrews - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks to everyone for joining us today. I would also like to take a moment to thank all of our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in what is the company\u2019s record year. We greatly appreciate everyone\u2019s efforts.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Cindy Buckwalter, Executive Vice President for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you, Ms. Buckwalter. You may begin. ", "Cindy Buckwalter ", "Thank you. Welcome and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter conference call. Today\u2019s call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Chairman of Take-Two; Ben Feder, our CEO; and Lainie Goldstein, our CFO. Our team will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. ", "Before we begin, I would first like to quickly review our Safe Harbor statement by reminding everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, and our 10-Q for the second quarter  ended April 30, 2009. These documents may be obtained from our website at www.taketwogames.com. ", "Now I will turn the call over to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Cindy and good afternoon, everyone. Today we\u2019ll review our financial results for the third quarter and discuss our operating highlights, our upcoming product lineup, and our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. ", "Take-Two's third quarter results were in line with the guidance that we provided in July. Our top line results were slightly better than our guidance due to higher-than-expected revenue from catalog titles. ", "Recent reports have confirmed that the U.S. retail environment for interactive entertainment has not significantly changed since our last call. We are continuing to see weak consumer spending, slow adoption of hardware, and caution on the part of retailers with respect to both their initial orders of new releases and inventory management. ", "Internationally we are seeing similar trends throughout Europe and Asia. Now on a positive note, France and Germany have each reported modest economic growth and they have announced that they are officially out of the recession. European hardware sales have held up reasonably well on the PS3 and Xbox 360 and we have seen a broadening of market demographics through further hardware adoption of the Wii and DS. ", "In the past month we have experienced increased sales of our catalog titles in France and Germany, which we think bodes well for upcoming triple A releases. Our industry success is driven by hit titles and we believe that several key products from our company and our peers will play an important role in driving the business this holiday season. ", "In Asia, western titles are gaining share across the region as high quality entertainment products and strong production values are becoming increasingly important to these consumers. China and Korea continue to enjoy exponential year-over-year growth in the online interactive entertainment category and analysts have predicted that the market could exceed $5 billion by 2012. We hope to benefit from the growth of this market through our partnership with Ten Cent to bring NBA 2K online to Asia. ", "While the overall software market in Japan has declined year over year, there\u2019s been growth in the Xbox 360 and Nintendo  DS. We\u2019ve seen our presence expand significantly in the region, driven by our proven brands and strong catalog, including titles such as Grand Theft Auto 4 and Midnight Club Los Angeles. There are many opportunities for Take-Two to capitalize further in this market, including investing in online products and leveraging the strength of our proven intellectual property. ", "All that said, clearly this has been and continues to be a challenging year for our industry and for our company. We believe that a prudent outlook is appropriate and we are maintaining our guidance for the fiscal year. ", "Looking forward, we are very excited about our terrific holiday lineup. The holidays historically have been the strongest sales period for our industry and we think that interactive entertainment will continue to be an important category this year.  We also believe the retailers and consumers will concentrate on triple A and value-oriented titles, the two key areas of our portfolio and strategy. We are pleased that both Sony and Microsoft have reduced the price of their systems and we hope that will serve as a catalyst for the continued growth of our industry and also help to expand the audience for our titles. ", "We are confident in our long-term outlook. We have an exceptional pipeline of titles for 2010. We have a strong balance sheet and remain focused on the efficiency of our business and we are both proud and pleased to work with many of the most talented people in our business. ", "Now I will turn the call over to Ben. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Thanks, Strauss. Today we reported net revenue for the third quarter was $139 million, a non-GAAP net loss was $50 million, or $0.66 per share This compared to revenue for the 2008 third quarter of $434 million, and non-GAAP net income of $71.5 million, or $0.93 per share. It\u2019s important to note that these results for our third quarter of 2008 reflected significant revenue from Grand Theft Auto 4, which launched at the end of our second quarter last year. ", "Third quarter sales this year were led by the big two, Grand Theft Auto 4 and Major League Baseball 2K9. Our catalog was once again a strong contributor to our quarterly performance, about 70% of our publishing revenue, and continues to provide predictability and visibility to our business. We ended the third quarter with $175 million in cash. ", "I would like to recap some of our business highlights for the quarter. We enhanced our balance sheet by completing a $138 million offering of convertible notes. This additional capital will allow us to react quickly to take advantage of opportunities that we may see in the marketplace for studio or IP acquisitions, strategic investments, and other initiatives to grow our business and create shareholder value. ", "Underscoring our commitment to increasing our presence in Asia, 2K Sports expanded on its successful relationship with the NBA by securing a multi-year license to develop an online basketball simulation game in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. 2K Sports in partnering with Ten Cent Holdings Limited, one of China\u2019s largest online videogame operators, to co-develop the online version of our top selling and top rated NBA 2K franchise, and distribute it in China and other key markets. ", "While we are only in the initial phase of this initiative, we are excited to be partnering with both the NBA and Ten Cent to extend the reach of our cornerstone sports brand. ", "2K Games released our first offering for the iPhone with Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization Revolution. The game launched on August 10th and quickly became a number one selling game on Apple\u2019s app store. It has since remained among the top 25 selling titles across all applications in most territories. We are very pleased with its initial performance which illustrates the power of our internally owned intellectual property to drive sales on any platform. ", "Internally owned IP provides us with the added benefit of creating new content at low incremental costs. We look forward to selectively bringing more of our established franchises, as well as new brands, to the Apple platforms, including the fall releases of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars and Rockstar Games and Timbaland Present [Beat-a-Rater]. ", "We exhibited at Games Con in Germany, which was hailed as the largest videogame trade event in the world with a quarter of a million attendees. We are very proud that Mafia 2 won for best PC game of the show and its developer, 2K Check, also won for best developer. We had thousands of consumers at our booth and received positive feedback from the European media and retailers for our titles, particularly Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City and Borderlands and [Beat-a-Rater], as well as Bioshock 2, Mafia 2, and Red Dead Redemption. ", "2K Sports launched the sequel to its popular Major League Baseball arcade franchise, The Bigs 2. 2K Games and Bethesda Softworks partnered to launch a value rich bundle of Bioshock and The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion for the Xbox 360 and PC. ", "Turning to our operations, we recently completed our initiative to outsource entirely our inventory fulfillment services. We now have an agreement with [Cineram] International to handle fulfillment for all of our Canadian business. We expect this initiative to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of our business and offer a high level of service to our customers. ", "As announced today, we have reached an agreement within principle to settle a previously disclosed consolidated securities class action. The litigation, which dates back to 2006, is related to allegations of the reported hot copy content and historical stock options granting practices. We are pleased to have reached this settlement and put this historical matter behind us. ", "Moving on to our holiday lineup, we are highly focused on delivering a diverse portfolio, led by two new titles from Rockstar Games, Grand Theft Auto universe. On October 29th, Rockstar Games will launched Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City, featuring two standalone games on Xbox 360 for $39.99. We think this title is perfectly timed and priced for the holiday season and will be a must-have item for both retail and consumers. ", "Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City will include The Ballad of Gay Tony and the Lost and Damned, two unique gaming experiences with the trademark characters and action that can only be found in the world of Grand Theft Auto. ", "We will also simultaneously release The Ballad of Gay Tony on Xbox Live as a downloadable episode. The Ballad of Gay Tony concludes a story arc that began in Grand Theft Auto IV with the combination of exciting new game play content and new characters. The first trailer launched today and will be supported by a comprehensive marketing campaign that will continue through the launch, positioning Episodes from Liberty City as the brand new Grand Theft Auto experience for this holiday. ", "Rockstar will also release Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for the PSP, PlayStation network, iPhone, and iPod Touch. We are proud to introduce this highly rated handheld game on the PSP, a platform on which millions of fans have enjoyed GTA games. The title is planned for release within the October launch window of the PSP Go and we expect to leverage the PR and industry buzz around the hardware introduction. ", "Award-winning studio Rockstar Leads has expanded and enhanced its critically acclaimed titles to make it the fastest, most explosive portable Grand Theft Auto experience to date. Editions for the PSP iteration of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars include more visual effects for the wider high definition screen, including more particle effects, dynamic lighting and shadowing, and higher resolution textures, a brand new character with a unique story thread, a variety of non-story missions, including rampages, and six new in-game radio stations featuring over 100 minutes of new music. ", "Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is the ultimate distillation of the best experiences and features of a Grand Theft Auto title all rolled into Sony\u2019s powerful portable platform. ", "2K Games will release Borderlands on October 20th in the U.S. and October 23rd internationally. This title has generated significant pre-launch excitement for both its unique art style and combination of first person and role-playing action. Developed by the talented team at Gear Box, Borderlands is poised to introduce a new game genre to our industry, the role playing shooter, or RPS. Several industry analysts and top gaming press have already picked Borderlands to be the sleeper hit of this holiday season. ", "Later this month, Rockstar will launch Rockstar Games and Timbaland present Beat-a-Rater for PSP and PlayStation Network. The title will also be available for the iPhone and iPod Touch later this fall. ", "Building on the demand from consumers for personal music games but with a clear focus on genuine music creation, Beat-a-Rater will feature thousands of loops and sounds created by both Timbaland and Rockstar Games. The title is being developed by Rockstar Leeds, the studio behind Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City, and Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories. Beat-a-Rater will put the power to make professional level music at your fingertips in a format that is portable, accessible, and fun, allowing anyone to create great sounding music. ", "2K Sports will release NBA 2K10, marking the 10th anniversary of our number one rated and number one selling basketball franchise. We are excited about this year\u2019s game, which allows the critical -- follows the critical and commercial success of NBA 2K9 that      has sold over 2 million units worldwide. Leading up to the launch of NBA 2K10, 2K Sports is offering NBA 2K10 Draft Combine, a downloadable experience for X-Box Live and PlayStation Network that allows gamers to create their own custom player, improve their skills through training and drills, and later import this player into NBA 2K10. We think this is an innovative way to use downloadable content to provide a deeper gaming experience leading up to and throughout the launch of the game. ", "2K Sports will also release NHL 2K10, the latest installment of our hockey franchise. This year\u2019s game will feature new online options and presentations, co-op game play, blog integration on 2Ksports.com, and a create-a-team mode. The Wii version of the game is already garnering strong reviews, scoring 8 out of 10 from Nintendo Power, and for the first time ever, NHL 2K10 will support online play on the Wii as well as take advantage of Wii motion plus and Wii Speak support. ", "Later this fall, 2K Play will introduce Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, and a new slate of Nickelodeon titles, based on [Nee Hao Kilon], Backyardigans, and Dora the Explorer. ", "Looking ahead to next year, we have a strong lineup that includes sequels to some of our most successful franchises, including Bioshock 2, Mafia 2, Max Payne 3, and Red Dead Redemption. We are continuing to evaluate the optimal release window for these titles and still plan to release all four titles in the first half of calendar 2010. At this point, we don\u2019t expect any of these titles to launch within our first fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2010. ", "We also have other new titles planned for the remainder of 2010 that will be announced in the coming months. This Thursday night, a new exclusive trailer for Bioshock 2 will be appearing on Game Trailers TV with Jeff Keeley on Spike TV that will feature never-before-seen footage of the game\u2019s multi-player action. We think it looks fantastic and will offer a taste of what gamers can look forward to in the next year. ", "I want to emphasize that Take-Two remains very well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and one of the best portfolios of triple A intellectual property in our industry. Our goals remain the same -- to explore and capitalize on new growth opportunities, continue to diversify our product portfolio, improve our efficiency and consistency in meeting release dates, and set new benchmarks for innovation and creativity. ", "I would like now to turn the call over to Lainie. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Ben and good afternoon, everyone. Today I will review our third quarter results and then discuss our outlook for the balance of the year. ", "Net revenue was $138.6 million in the third quarter compared with $433.8 million a year ago. Last year\u2019s Q2 results included significant sales of Grand Theft Auto 4, which launched at the end of Q2 of last year. ", "Non-GAAP net loss was $50.4 million, or $0.66 per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $71.5 million or $0.93 per share last year. Our press release provides a complete reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers. ", "As expected, we had a relatively light new release schedule in Q3. The quarter\u2019s revenue drivers were catalog titles from Grand Theft Auto 4. Other top titles included the Bigs 2 and Major League Baseball 2K9. ", "Our GAAP results for the third quarter were a net loss of approximately $55 million or $0.72 per share, compared with net income of $52 million or $0.67 per share in the third quarter of 2008. ", "Our GAAP results this year included $4.6 million in stock-based compensation expense and approximately $400,000 of professional fees and expenses related to unusual legal matters. ", "In looking at our consolidated results, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 17.5% compared to 41% in Q2 of last year, when Grand Theft Auto 4 represented a significant percentage of our revenue. ", "Our gross margin this quarter was also affected by the following factors: distribution represented a higher percentage of our net revenue than in Q3 of last year,  31% compared to only 12% last year. Sports represented a much higher percentage of our publishing revenue than last year. ", "We realized accelerated amortization expense related to our Major League Baseball license based on our lower-than-expected sales of MLB titles for this year.  We also realized lower average pricing for several of our titles, as well as a significant percentage of revenue from catalog sales. ", "Excluding our sports and distribution businesses, our split between North America and international revenue was about 50-50. ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were approximately $59 million, down significantly from the prior year third quarter and also from Q2 of this year. Sales and marketing expenses accounted for the largest increase of over $17 million, compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to the launch of Grand Theft Auto 4, which had a significant marketing budget. ", "G&A decreased by $7 million from Q3 2008, driven by lower consulting and professional fees, reduced performance based compensation expense, and our cost-cutting initiatives. A portion of the decrease was also related to foreign exchange effects. ", "R&D decreased by about $2 million, primarily due to higher capitalization rates, foreign exchange effects also had a positive impact. ", "Depreciation and amortization decreased by $1.7 million from Q3 2008 due to last year\u2019s sale of certain assets in connection with outsourcing our U.S. distribution services. ", "Moving on to our balance sheet, at the end of Q3 we had $175 million in cash. Our accounts receivable reserve was about $44 million at the end of the quarter, or approximately 39% of gross receivables, about the same as the third quarter last year. ", "Inventory at the end of the quarter was approximately $64 million, down significantly from year-end due to seasonality. ", "Software development costs and licenses have increased in line with the significant development efforts around our triple A holiday and fiscal 2010 releases. We currently have 37 titles in various stages of development. ", "Now for our outlook, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are updating our fiscal 2009 guidance slightly based on our Q3 actual results and our Q4 forecasts. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.81 to $0.87 on $975 million to $1 billion in revenue.  This excludes stock-based compensation expense of $0.30 per share and expenses related to unusual legal matters of $0.10 per share. ", "As we said previously, maintaining our release schedule is critical to achieving our fiscal year numbers. Our results might also be affected by variability in foreign exchange rates, which are difficult to forecast. ", "Moving on to Q4, we expect non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share on $350 million to $375 million in revenue. This excludes stock-based compensation of $0.08 per share, and expenses related to unusual legal matters of $0.01 per share. ", "We tightened our Q4 guidance range as we\u2019ve obtained more visibility into Q4. ", "Since Q4 is forecast to be profitable, diluted EPS will reflect the impact of our stock compensation plans on the convertible offering for the first time since the converts issuance. Based on our current forecast in calculating diluted EPS, U.S.  GAAP requires us to assume our notes were converted at the beginning of the quarter, which means $13 million more shares outstanding during the quarter. The calculation will also exclude after-tax interest expense on the convert. This brings our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximately $92 million in Q4 for an accounting dilution impact from the convert of approximately $0.03. ", "As the full fiscal year 2009 guidance is expected to be a loss, the shares underlying the convert are anti-dilutive, so diluted EPS will equal basic for the full year. ", "Our key releases in Q4 are Rockstar Games and Timbaland Present Beat-a-Rater, Borderlands, Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City, The Ballad of Gay Tony, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, NBA 2K10 and NHL 2K10. Our large Q4 release schedule should result in a revenue mix of about 80% from publishing and 20% from distribution and we expect gross profit margins to increase into the low 30s in that quarter. ", "We expect overall operating expenses to increase in Q4 as compared to Q2 and Q3, primarily driven by significantly higher sales and marketing expenses to support the launch of our Q4 and holiday season titles. ", "G&A, R&D, and depreciation and amortization should remain relatively flat in Q4 as compared to Q2 and Q3. ", "Based on our forecast, we expect to show a few million dollars of tax expense in Q4, primarily reflecting earnings in our international territories. ", "I will conclude by saying that continue to remain highly focused on pursuing revenue opportunities that leverage our strong catalog of titles, as well as identifying and implementing further areas of cost savings. We are also in the midst of our 2010 budgeting process, which includes firming up our release schedule. We expect to have more to say about 2010 on our year-end call in December. ", "Now I will turn the call back to Strauss. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Lainie, thanks, Ben and we will now take your questions. Operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Heath Terry with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ", "Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets", "[inaudible] ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Sorry, Heath, we didn\u2019t actually hear that question on this end -- would you mind repeating it?", "Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets", "Sure. I was just saying I was hoping you could give us an idea of what you have seen from your retail partners in recent weeks following the price cuts on hardware. ", "Benjamin Feder", "You know, we haven\u2019t seen -- we don\u2019t have anything to report today on what we have seen from retail. I think our outlook hasn\u2019t changed with respect to retail. We think they are still being kind of tentative and cautious. I think the effect of the price cut is really too early to tell and I know kind of where, you know, [wondering if we\u2019re off cycle] in terms of our competitors but it\u2019s really -- we don\u2019t really have a lot of data to share in terms of what retail is seeing from the price cuts. It\u2019s really just too early. ", "Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of  Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the call. Two questions, if I might -- first, since earlier this year announcing that the push-out of a couple of big titles maybe gave you a little more breathing room in the development. With that time, have you done any additional restructuring within the organization to [inaudible] or do you feel like the average you get in the first year [inaudible] you know, have gotten teamwork where you want it to be in terms of scale and structure?", "And then second question with the increase in games available on things like the iPhone and now PSP Go and maybe DSI Wear and of course Xbox Live, two questions on that. One is where do you think that the size of that direct to consumer digital distribution could go for you over the next one to five years? And then two, is there any comment you can give us on the margin profile of that type of game relative to the box sale? Thanks. ", "Benjamin Feder", "With respect to the product slippage, when we initially slipped the title, we had indicated that we were taking it seriously and that something had -- you know, in our view something kind of didn\u2019t quite work the way it was supposed to work in terms of our greenlight process and our review process, and given the technical complexities of our product development, it\u2019s not entirely surprising but nonetheless, we took it very seriously and we continue to take it seriously. ", "We don\u2019t have today kind of -- we don\u2019t have anything to announce today in terms of how our processes will change. We are evaluating this currently. We have looked for outside help in terms of ways to improve our performance and improve our process and we think we are making some progress but this is still a work in progress and we are still trying to -- we are fixing our processes to the extent that they were broken in the first place but somewhere between process and the complexity of our games, some of these delays are expected and some of them should not be expected and we are trying to -- we are still in the process of figuring out what\u2019s what, what\u2019s where. ", "In terms of the iPhone, Strauss, do you want to handle that?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah, I think Dan, you asked about the iPhone specifically in digital opportunities more generally speaking and as you know, a bit part of our strategy, a third of our strategy is the notion of innovation and we have outlined -- we outlined it two years ago and we continue to hammer home the notion that ongoing innovation is a big part of what we want to do around here. Mobile platforms in general, the iPhone and iTouch more specifically, are a key part of that. You know, six out of 10 human beings on the earth have mobile devices and they do use them to play interactive entertainment and to enjoy it. It\u2019s been somewhat hard to find -- for the industry, not for us -- to find the right business model to approach that. We are really proud of our intellectual property and I guess 16 franchises that have sold more than a million units, all of which are owned by our company. You know, we think we have the best collection of owned intellectual property in the industry. So bringing that to the consumers who don\u2019t have consoles and maybe don\u2019t even have PCs but do have mobile devices is pretty important. Just yesterday we made an announcement about Chinatown Wars being available on the iPhone and iTouch. Beat-a-Rater obviously will be available on Apple platforms and we are going to continue to look to that as an opportunity. It is early days and the price points vary from consoles and handheld dedicated devices and it isn\u2019t clear what the consumer up-tick will be but I think all of us are proud and excited by first of all, we think the quality is just phenomenal -- obviously we think that but that is our strategy, right? Whatever platform we are producing for, the quality should be A-plus and the titles just are phenomenal. We\u2019re really proud of that and we think consumers will see it the same way. ", "In terms of its economic impact, it\u2019s too early to say. ", "More broadly on digital, you know, we are a pioneer in downloadable content with the two episodes for Grand Theft Auto 4. At the same time, retail remains our primary channel and so we are making those episodes available without having to buy the original title on a disc this fall for consumers and we are really excited about that. We think it\u2019s a terrific opportunity for consumers. ", "So it was sort of the best of both worlds -- we were able to lead the way from an innovation point of view by seeing how downloadable content would do. They were critically highly acclaimed, creatively highly acclaimed. I will tell you that the team at Rockstar was utterly engaged creatively with their creation and that\u2019s a big part of what we do around here, is to make sure that our talented people here are working on what they are passionate about, not to the detriment of our economics, in concert with our economics but obviously it\u2019s a win-win if we can work on things that people are passionate about and also create an opportunity for economics for the company and the shareholders and at the same time, pursue our strategy of innovation. ", "So I think that is a perfect example of trying something digitally, making it available in our biggest channel, which is retail, in a way that benefits everyone and primarily benefits consumers. There are also a lot of other digital opportunities on the horizon, including the on-live system and other competitive systems. Too early to say how they will develop but obviously anything like that is a good thing for us. ", "Finally, your question on margin for digital, the business will be different. It doesn\u2019t encompass hard goods and it is by definition most likely a more open system than the traditional console business and there is an opportunity for us to drive a higher margin from doing that. ", "But now we are speculating about what will succeed, what content will work, which systems will work, and what the economic model will be, so I think I will leave it at that. ", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Excellent. Thanks for the color. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Mike Hickey with Janco Partners.", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Thanks for taking my questions. Lainie, I think you said you are working through your fiscal 10 budget process now, but some of the key drivers for your fiscal 10 were supposed to come out in fiscal 09, that being Bioshock 2, Max Payne and Red Dead, or Mafia, I guess, not Max Payne. I think that was a fiscal 10 event but do you expect any adjustment to your original sales assumptions from those games now coming out in fiscal \u201910 than what you had in fiscal \u201909?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, as we are building our fiscal 2010 budget, we are looking at it in a fresh way in terms of what is going on in the market right now, what the competitive landscape looks like, and the timing in which these games are going to be released. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay, you mentioned timing -- you said post-January now for the big four. I think before you said first half of calendar year \u201910 -- is that time window still consistent or is it open now?", "Lainie Goldstein", "That timing is consistent. We said the first half of calendar year 2010. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay, and then finally for the games that were delayed, can you give us any sort of -- I know this may be sensitive but can you give us any sort of updates on the development of those games? Have the new milestones that have been set, have they been met? And then Strauss, you talk a lot about quality -- do you have any specific targets or ranges for quality on these sets of games?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Our quality standards haven\u2019t changed. You know, we expect -- most of our games we expect to be top rated games. Some of the genres, some of the sports genres don\u2019t have to be kind of 90s, and they are hard to get 90s in the sports genre but nonetheless, NBA for example, we expect to be extremely high rated and already is the highest rated game. ", "So we are not -- you know, our standards for quality haven\u2019t changed. In terms of updates and milestones of the games that have been released, so far they are meeting their milestones. We do follow-up on the games, we are checking up on the games. They are meeting their milestones so far and we don\u2019t expect today -- sitting here today we don\u2019t expect any changes from our release schedule. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay, thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Good afternoon. A couple of questions for you -- first of call, can you just talk a little bit more about the retailer buying patterns, what you are seeing for kind of an initial order at this stage relative to a year ago and relative to earlier this year? And then as a follow-up on the iPhone, Strauss, can you comment a little bit about what you expect as far as the revenue per game is concerned and what if any cannibalization we might see on the handhelds from moving to the iPhone and the iPod Touch? And then lastly, if you can just give us whatever color you can on the FY2010 releases in terms of which games are coming in the first half of the year or what you have at this point that we can kind of look at and focus on for that time period. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "In terms of your first question, retailer buying patterns, the most I can say is that they are being -- they are still being tentative and cautious. Last time we spoke, the  Christmas season was probably a little more crowded, you know, Bioshock was still in there, Splinter Cell was still in there. It\u2019s becoming a little less crowded so I think retailers are a little happier with that. At the same time, they\u2019ve had to move some of their earnings out from this year into next year. But next year is kind of looking a little less seasonal than this year has been looking. ", "I will also say that retailers tend to be looking at pre-sales kind of more closely than they have in the past -- pre-orders, excuse me -- and we are seeing some of that emphasis on pre-orders but that\u2019s really just symbolic of the caution that they are approaching the market with. ", "In terms of iPhone revenue per game, I think it\u2019s really hard. We\u2019ve launched one game on iPhone so far. It\u2019s rare that you have both a winner and a learning experience at the same time but we have it with Civilization Evolutions. It was the number one game when we launched. On the one hand, we were very pleased with the performance. On the other hand, we are learning a lot through Civilization Revolutions in terms of price point, in terms of take-up rates and what\u2019s driving sales. So it\u2019s really early to tell. I mean, everybody knows the app store tends to be crowded and going more crowded, not less crowded. And we think that what drives consumers in that kind of a market is brands and franchises. Those are the guide posts that help consumers find what\u2019s quality and what\u2019s worth buying and that\u2019s one of the primary reasons that Civilization Revolution did so well, apart from the quality of the game. ", "In terms of titles for 2010, we have nothing new to report in terms of update on timing. I think what we have said, the four major titles that we have announced so far in the first half of calendar 2010 but not before January 31, 2010. ", "Benjamin Feder", "That narrows it down to four months. Just a couple more points on the cannibalization -- sorry, five months -- a couple of more points on the cannibalization issue. You know, we are not porting. These are standalone titles for different platforms and people use their iPhone and their iTouch in different ways than they use their PSP and their DS and people use their PC even in different ways than they use their consoles, so these are -- because we are so focused on quality here, these are not ports. These are standalone titles and they are much more like line extensions leveraging intellectual property and leveraging the franchise than they are a port. ", "So I think cannibalization for a company like ours with labels like ours who are focused on making sure that every release that we put out is on a standalone basis really high quality, really compelling, means that we can tailor our titles to the particular platform and that is certainly what we are trying to do on iPhone. ", "Could that change over time if the platforms become more similar? Sure but people have been projecting that for the PC for an awful long time and it really hasn\u2019t happened yet, so I don\u2019t really expect it will happen with a handheld device either. I am also pretty convinced that you use an iPhone for entertainment in a way that\u2019s different than in the way you use a PSP or a DS in terms of how much time you devote and the engagement with the experience, the kind of engagement you actually want and I suspect the iPhone and iTouch calls for a more bite-sized experience than the PSP or the DS. ", "All that said, I think we\u2019re not as worried about cannibalization and frankly even if we were, we\u2019d rather have a larger market share for our intellectual property across all possible platforms than we would to try to parse what a consumer might possibly want in the highest value platform. ", "Within the very narrow rubric of doing triple A titles for our owned intellectual property, within that very narrow rubric we try to be very, very broad about what we can offer our consumers because we aim to delight them with the best products in the business. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Sorry, I\u2019d add to that -- one of the things that is exciting potentially about the iPhone is the expansion of the markets. You know, Nintendo  did a great job expanding the demographic of the market. The core gaming audience is still pretty much just the core gaming audience but what makes the iPhone and iPod Touch particularly exciting is their broad reach to a broad demographic, not just in the way they interact with interactive entertainment but also just their access to interactive entertainment, so the promise of a much greater audience benefits us as it does all publishers. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Just as a quick follow-up to that, how do you see marketing to those things -- how do you see marketing to the iPhone, iPod Touch consumer and how different is that versus traditional marketing? And then secondly, how do you improve the marketing to drive the pre-orders to therefore lead to the retailers increasing the initial orders of your key titles?", "Strauss Zelnick", "You know, on your second question first, this is -- you know, I think it would be a mistake to think of iPod Touch and iPhone as strictly promotion for a retail sale. They can be used that way but they can also be profitable games in their own right, and so I would be careful about thinking of this as just promotion. ", "In terms of the marketing to iPhone and iPod Touch, I would say two things -- one is as I said, we\u2019re still learning. We experimented, for example, with price points on iPod Touch -- we were $5, $10, $5 again and we kind of understand a little bit more about consumer behavior and what drives consumer behavior. ", "The other important thing to mention is that we are spending a lot of time with our marketing group making sure that we have a world class marketing group that understands consumer behavior, that can launch a new product, take the learning, learn from that, kind of propagate that throughout the company so that the next time we launch on the app store, we have better knowledge and we are better at marketing. ", "So I think it\u2019s really too early to kind of call a business model for the iPod Touch and the iPhone but it\u2019s not too early to be learning and it\u2019s not too early to bring our brands to the market. ", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee & Leach.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach ", "Thank you. A couple of questions -- one, you talked about Europe being relatively weak. You mentioned France and Germany, however, were doing better. I wonder if you could talk about the U.K. in particular, given they are not doing too well from your perspective. Are they down just as much as the U.S. in the recent month or so? That\u2019s my first question, and then I have a follow-up. ", "Benjamin Feder", "You know, the U.K., I would say maybe not -- you know, the thing about France and Germany, just showing kind of what\u2019s known as early green chutes now. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen that out of the U.K., per se. In terms of our own catalog and our own products, certainly for third quarter, seems to be doing okay, seems to be holding up. You know, our sales team there is kind of second to none. We are really proud of their efforts and their relationships with retail partners and so far, knock on wood, things have held up pretty nicely for us there. ", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach ", "Have you seen any piracy issues there on the DS? I know that\u2019s not a big focus next quarter for you but have you seen any issues on DS piracy?", "Benjamin Feder", "Without question there are issues on DS piracy. Without going into great detail in numbers, it\u2019s an issue. ", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach ", "Okay, and one last question -- I don\u2019t know if you can really answer this but I just want to understand your strategy on the announcement of your next GTA franchise. Whenever that is going to be, how long prior to that do you think you will be able to communicate that? And I say that because in the past, it\u2019s varied where you\u2019ve announced it as early as six months to a year before the launch. I just wonder if you can give us some color without giving us exact timing, obviously, as to the strategy you\u2019re thinking is?", "Strauss Zelnick", "So we\u2019re not going to announce it, we\u2019re not going to announce when we are going to announce it, and we are not going to announce a strategy about announcing it or about when we are going to announce it either, or about the announcement strategy surrounding the announcement of the strategy. ", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach ", "Okay. Sounds good, sir. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Any other questions?", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach ", "Last question I guess is on the cash flow -- Lainie, can you talk about cash flow for this year that you were modeling based on the EPS guidance?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, we don\u2019t share our cash flow projections but I can tell you that in Q4, we will be using cash as our release schedule is heavily weighted towards the back end of the quarter and we will be collecting the cash on those sales in Q1 of next year. ", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach ", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Benjamin Schachter with Broadpoint.", "Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint", "A few questions, but hopefully they are pretty quick -- what does the launch of Project Natal and Sony\u2019s motion sensor mean for Take-Two next year and are you guys already working on titles that are going to utilize those capabilities?", "And then on the new GTA download, not the packaged goods that is in the stores but the actual download itself, what are the lessons learned from the original [inaudible] in terms of marketing and sales for that?", "And then also if you could talk about sports, wondering how pre-orders are looking for NBA versus last year. ", "And then finally one more -- online packaged good retailers like Amazon, could you talk about the trend lines there in terms of how important they are to the business this year versus last year and where you think that goes? Thanks. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Strauss, why don\u2019t you take the download first and then I\u2019ll -- ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah, I mean, I think the lesson learned from our point of view is that we are grateful that we took it on. We were passionate about trying it, it\u2019s a good piece of business for us. It was very highly rated and we now have actually another retail opportunity here. Also another opportunity to expand the audience so consumers will be able to consumer Grand Theft Auto 4, another iteration on a standalone basis either online if they have access to online or in a packaged good. So I think the lessons learned, probably the biggest lesson learned is that it is possible to come out with something very high quality that\u2019s a subset of the original title [and a line extension] and I think the second lesson learned is that one of the biggest shifts in the interactive entertainment business is that now like basically every other entertainment business, there are multiple windows available for an individual product and that will probably change everyone\u2019s view of product creation, line extension and line expansion. ", "So I think the lessons learned have been good ones. ", "Benjamin Feder", "Yeah, but if I may, Strauss, I think one of the lessons that not just in this download but some other download experiences, it\u2019s clear that retail is the channel for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, there is a download component to a lot of our games and there will continue to be a download component. The games live online and they live at retail, they live at both and whether that is download first, retail second/retail first, download second or some combination of the two, that\u2019s an area that we are going to experiment with because we are innovating in that area and it\u2019s likely to change from title to title, but everything is going to have a download component, needs to have a download component to it and this is kind of one of the key lessons and we\u2019ll see how -- see how GTA in the retail SKU performs. We are actually pretty optimistic about it and we think it\u2019s terrific value, I mean, for $40, two great GTA games, new content available in retail is an unbelievable value. ", "And so the downloads help to seed that market and we think will be critically important. ", "In terms of your other questions, Natal motion sensor, yes, we have dev kits. Yes we are working on them. Obviously can\u2019t comment on games that we haven\u2019t announced but those dev kits are embedded in all of our studios or just about all of our studios and everybody is working with them to try to figure out new ways in which we can innovate and create the kind of content that this company is famous for. So yes, we are working on it. ", "Sports -- NBA pre-orders, we don\u2019t talk about pre-orders. My expectation is that, and my hope is that NBA will continue to take market share. We think this will -- NBA 2K10 will be a game that we are going to be very, very proud of. We are thrilled by Kobe Bryant not only on the cover but also as a spokesperson. He\u2019s a terrific spokesperson, and not only a great athlete but a great articulator of what the game can be, so we are pleased about that. ", "Your last question in terms of online packaged goods and trending this year versus last year, it\u2019s a great question. I don\u2019t have the data in front of me but I will tell you that we are seeing, at least in the U.S., a greater concentration at retail, so that the top five retailers are taking more market share and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a trend, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s -- the significance of all that but we are seeing some data that shows that -- again, kind of too early to kind of call a trend but would not surprise me to see further concentration at retail. ", "Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint", "Great, thanks for answering all of the questions and good luck. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Hickey. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Thanks, guys for taking the quick follow-up -- can you just refresh us on the development of [L.A. Noir]?", "Benjamin Feder", "It\u2019s in development. Nothing to announce today. And when we have more to announce, we will announce it but we\u2019re continuing to develop it. We think it\u2019s pretty exciting and innovative and when we have more to share, we\u2019ll share it. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "And is that still being handled by your Rockstar San Diego Studio?", "Benjamin Feder", "It\u2019s handled by Rockstar. ", "Mike Hickey - Janco Partners", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Benjamin Feder", "If there are no more questions, thank you all for joining us today. We really appreciate it and we will be back to you in the next quarter. Thanks a lot.

Sir, you may begin.", "Henry Diamond", "Good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 ended September 30, 2012. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our Chief Operating Officer; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before we get started, I'd just like to take a minute to acknowledge that those of us who are here in New York have witnessed and experienced a pretty tough couple of days with the storm that just came through here. Our team has been very fortunate. We are not unmindful of the fact there's been a significant loss of life in this tragedy, a great deal of loss of property and a great deal of displacement and dislocation. Our own headquarters have been displaced by the events. We're located downtown. And I think our team has done an extraordinary job of conducting business as usual despite that, for which I'm immensely grateful.", "I did want to acknowledge, in the light of that, what we're about to talk today is business. And our business is that of providing people with light entertainment. We take it very seriously but it is -- pales in comparison to the seriousness of these events and we want to acknowledge that. That said, it's our job to go on with things and we aim to do that.", "In that context, I'm pleased to report that Take-Two delivered exceedingly strong results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Our revenue and our earnings beat guidance due to the success of 2K's Borderlands 2, along with robust demand for our catalog and our digitally delivered offerings.", "Borderlands 2 has become one of the most critically and commercially successful releases in 2K's history. The title received stellar reviews from the media and consumers alike, achieving an average Metacritic score of 90, including a perfect 100 from PlayStation: The Official Magazine, and a near-perfect 98 from Game Informer. It's already sold more than 5 million units worldwide and consumer demand for the title remains strong.", "Like its predecessor, Borderlands 2 is being supported by an array of downloadable add-on content that promises to keep consumers engaged with the title for many months beyond its launch.", "I'd like to take a minute to congratulate the teams of 2K and Gearbox for building upon the successful franchise with another superb entertainment experience.", "Digitally delivered content for both traditional and emerging platforms represents an important component of our strategy to drive growth and profits. During the second quarter, our revenue from digitally delivered content more than doubled year-over-year and accounted for 20% of non-GAAP net revenue. The largest contributor was full game downloads of Borderlands 2 as well as strong demand for our PC titles, add-on content offerings and mobile titles. We expect digitally delivered revenue to continue to grow significantly over time, particularly once our online projects in Asia reach critical mass.", "Our diverse portfolio of catalog offerings is an important asset that differentiates Take-Two from our competition. During the second quarter, we continued to benefit from strong demand for our most iconic titles, including Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption, which are still generating meaningful revenues and profits years after initial launch.", "Building upon the momentum of Borderlands 2, 2K has delivered a winning trifecta of stellar releases with the October launches of NBA 2K13 and XCOM: Enemy Unknown. NBA 2K13 has once again raised the bar of excellence for our basketball franchise and further cemented its well-earned place in pop culture. The title received critical acclaim, including a perfect 10 from PlayStation: The Official Magazine, who said that the game's improvements, \"elevates 2K13 beyond mere annual greatness and into a Hall of Fame consideration.\" In addition, this year's version breaks new ground with the introduction of NBA 2K Everywhere. This multi-platform offering gives fans the opportunity to experience NBA 2K via an all-new mobile companion app, a social game on Facebook, and a full feature version of the game for tablets and smartphones.", "During the first week after its release, NBA 2K13 sold through 49% more units than the franchise's previous fastest seller. Moreover, in-game purchases are exceeding our expectations and, for the first time, are poised to be a meaningful contributor to the game's bottom line. I'd like to congratulate the team at Visual Concepts for delivering what is shaping up to be our most successful sports release ever.", "XCOM: Enemy Unknown marked the return of one of the interactive entertainment industry's most beloved franchises. The game has received rave reviews, yielding an average Metacritic score of near 90. Game Informer called the title a singular achievement that every gamer deserves to experience and awarded it their game of the month honors and a 9.5 out of 10. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is generating particularly strong digitally delivered sales and promises to be another commercial success for 2K. I'd like to congratulate Firaxis Games on reimagining this franchise and creating a truly one-of-a-kind experience for consumers.", "Looking ahead, we have a strong pipeline of announced and unannounced titles in development, which we're confident will continue to delight and captivate consumers around the world. Without question, our most eagerly anticipated release is Grand Theft Auto V, which Rockstar Games yesterday announced is planned for worldwide launch during spring 2013.", "While the current fiscal year began with a disappointing first quarter, today our business is firing on all cylinders. Our second quarter results and recent business trends have exceeded our expectations, and the outlook for our upcoming releases such as BioShock Infinite is stronger than ever. As a result, we continue to expect to deliver revenue growth and non-GAAP profits for fiscal year 2013, even without a major new release of Grand Theft Auto, and we're positioned to generate substantial revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2014.", "I'd like to turn the call now over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Strauss.

Legends is available for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, and 2K is exploring bringing the game to additional mobile devices.

This premium box set for the Xbox 360 and PS3 contains 4 of the label's most popular and critically acclaimed titles, including Red Dead Redemption, Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City, L.A. Noire, and Midnight Club: Los Angeles Complete Edition. At a suggested retail price of $59.99, this collection is both an incredible value and perfectly timed for the holiday season.", "Also this fall, in celebration of the title's 10th anniversary, Rockstar Games plans to release a mobile version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City for a wide range of iOS and Android devices. This will be our second offering of a full console experience of Grand Theft Auto designed for tablets and smartphones, joining Grand Theft Auto III: 10th Anniversary Edition, which has been our highest selling mobile release to date.", "On November 18, 2K Sports will release our first offering for the Wii U, NBA 2K13, as part of the anticipated launch of Nintendo's new console. Also in November, 2K Play will launch our 2012 lineup of Nickelodeon games.

Just last week, we revealed that the massively multiplayer ongoing game we've been codeveloping in Korea is based on 2K's successful Civilization strategy franchise. Our Firaxis Games studio is working in partnership with renowned South Korean-based studio XLGAMES to design the title from the ground up as an entirely new online-only entertainment experience for the Asian market. The project is being led by XLGAMES CEO Jake Song, who is famous for his integral role in creating the popular Korean massive multiplayer online role-playing game Lineage, which has attracted 43 million players.

Today, I'll review our results for the second quarter and then discuss our updated outlook for the full year fiscal 2013 and our initial outlook for the third quarter. All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP results from continuing operations, unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we delivered net revenue of $288 million, up 169% from the prior year. This result exceeded our outlook range of $200 million to $250 million due to the breakout success of Borderlands 2, along with better-than-expected catalog and digital sales.", "Catalog sales accounted for 28% of net revenue, led by Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption. Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 108% year-over-year and accounted for 20% of net revenue, driven by offerings for the Borderlands franchise, in particular digital sales of Borderlands 2, as well as the Grand Theft Auto franchise, the Sid Meier's Civilization franchise and Max Payne 3.", "Gross margin increased to 43.7%, up 13.1 percentage points year-over-year, as this year's second quarter revenue mix was heavily weighted towards higher-priced new releases versus lower-priced catalog titles in last year's second quarter.", "Operating expenses were approximately $112 million, up about $44 million versus the prior year's second quarter, driven primarily by higher marketing expenses to support the release of Borderlands 2.", "Interest and other expense increased versus the prior year, primarily due to the convertible notes that we issued in November 2011. And non-GAAP net income was $10.2 million or $0.11 per share as compared to non-GAAP net loss of $39.4 million or $0.47 per share in fiscal second quarter 2012. This result is significantly better than our outlook range, which projected non-GAAP net loss of $0.30 to $0.15 per share. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $12.4 million or $0.15 per share.", "Turning to some key items from our balance sheet at September 30, 2012, as compared to June 30, 2012. Our cash balance decreased to $328.3 million. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $155 million, primarily reflecting the release of Borderlands 2 near the end of the second quarter.", "Inventory increased to $60.6 million, primarily due to stock on hand for our October releases of NBA 2K13 and XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and replenishment orders of Borderlands 2. And software development cost and licenses increased to $281.4 million, reflecting the significant development efforts around our pipeline of upcoming releases.", "Now I will review our financial outlook for the full year and third quarter fiscal 2013, which is all provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are updating our financial outlook for fiscal 2013 to reflect our revised assumed release schedule, partially offset by our better-than-expected second-quarter results, strong current business trends and robust sales outlook for the remainder of the year. We now expect non-GAAP revenue to range from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and non-GAAP net income to range from breakeven to $0.20 per share.", "Turning to the details of our full year outlook, our expected revenue range assumes the on-time release of the titles we have announced to date, as well as other titles yet to be announced for release during fiscal 2013. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 25% from Rockstar and 75% from 2K. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect gross margins in the low 40s.", "Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 30% from fiscal 2012, primarily driven by higher marketing expense to support our new releases and the $15-million onetime contractual obligation recognized in the first quarter.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 22% of net revenue, using the midpoint of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $13 million, tax expense of about $7 million and fully diluted shares of approximately 92 million, which includes 6 million of participating shares for our unvested stock-based compensation awards.", "Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect to deliver non-GAAP revenue ranging from $325 million to $375 million and non-GAAP net income ranging from $0.45 to $0.60 per share. The majority of our revenue in the third quarter is expected to come from the release of NBA 2K13, continued sales of Borderlands 2 and the release of XCOM: Enemy Unknown. We expect third quarter gross margins in the upper 40s.", "Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 40% from the prior year third quarter, driven primarily by higher sales and marketing expense to support our recent and upcoming releases. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 17% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range.", "Our third quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $3 million, tax expense of about $2 million and a share count of approximately 118 million, which includes 6 million of participating shares for our unvested stock-based compensation awards and 26 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the if-converted method of accounting.", "In closing, we are pleased with our recent business performance. Our better-than-expected results in the second quarter and strong sales outlook are enabling us to overcome our first-quarter loss and continue to project a profitable fiscal year 2013 on a non-GAAP basis, even without a major new release of Grand Theft Auto. We expect to deliver significant revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2014 and return to our shareholder over the long term.", "Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. Our recent results underscore that Take-Two possesses the key attributes necessary to succeed in today's challenging environment: world-class creative teams, the strongest intellectual property portfolio in the business, a measured strategy to invest in digitally delivered content for both traditional and emerging platforms, and a sound financial footing.", "We remain committed to delivering the highest quality entertainment experiences that translate into growth and profits for our shareholders. I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication, especially during these trying times. Everyone has come together as a team, working in some instances remotely, and making sure that the business continues without missing a beat. It's pretty extraordinary. And for that, the entire management team is immensely grateful. I'd also like to thank our shareholders for your continued support for joining us today, and I wish you all safety and soundness for yourselves, your homes, and your families.", "And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have just 2 questions on guidance. First, for the holiday quarter, could you tell us what NBA has sold in the past? And then maybe help us understand how you could hit the low end of guidance, I think it's 3 25, with NBA selling very strong, Borderlands presumably getting reorders and XCOM commercially successful. It seems pretty low. Maybe you could kind of -- what would have to happen to hit the low end? And then secondly, when you guided fiscal '13 originally, I think it was over 1.5 years ago, you were willing to guide $2 for that. I'm just kind of wondering, now the GTA has shifted out to fiscal '14, why you can't guide that year at this point?", "Lainie Goldstein", "It's Lainie. For the holiday quarter, we don't give out on a title-by-title basis how the revenue comes together. But I can tell you that it's based on our best estimates as of right now and how we're selling into the market and what our anticipating is going to be with the holiday season, which we think will be very strong. This is done by a title-by-title basis and rolled out. In terms of fiscal year '14, we're not at the stage right now to give out guidance for that year. So we're not doing so at this time.", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe a follow-up. Just to hit the low end though for the holiday quarter, like, would it have to be tough market conditions or would the catalog for NBA really have to fall off? Or what kind of scenario do you see for the low end?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We're not trying to parse it more specifically than that. As Lainie said, we aim with guidance to give our best estimate of where we'll land without too much conservatism or too much optimism. We try to hit what we think will be the case.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Wondered if you could sort of help us think about how we can start modeling in Asia and particularly with NBA now going live in China. And how you're looking at that business, I guess, I'm assuming from a royalty standpoint.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Eric, it's Lainie. For Asia, we haven't really shared the details on how the economics are going to work for us yet. So I can't really explain exactly how to model it in. For fiscal year '13, it's a pretty small part of our business, but we plan for it to be bigger in the future years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC", "A couple questions here. I guess, this is a little bit of a follow-up to Justin's question. Can you break down to whatever level possible what's changed since the last earnings call in terms of your outlook? I mean, you touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but you basically beat the second quarter by $0.33 at your midpoint. You're bringing down the full year by $1.70. So basic math would suggest you've basically shifted $2 out of this year and into next. Is it as simple as that? Or are there some other takes, some other things on the negative side of the ledger that I should be considering as I think about earnings power this year and next?", "Lainie Goldstein", "James, this is Lainie. The difference between the 2 periods, there's a lot of missing -- there's a lot of pieces that go back and forth each quarter as we update our number. The biggest driver is obviously GTA V is now fiscal year '14, and we've announced that it's during spring 2013 release time period, not in this fiscal year. The revised estimates are mostly the updates on our currently released titles. Obviously strength from Borderlands and NBA and our catalog. But there's also other titles that will go up and down depending on how they're performing in the marketplace. And we also feel our -- we have continued strength in our catalog into Q3 and Q4 that's included in our numbers for this year.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC", "Fair enough. Let's talk a little bit about the fourth quarter sort of implied guidance. Obviously, with BioShock Infinite coming out, you guys feel pretty good about how the fourth quarter is shaping up. If I sort of back into a sales number, I'm looking at about $286 million, which is pretty close to what you guys made in the second quarter. But the earnings power seems to be a lot better. How should I think about sort of the margin profile in the fourth quarter? Does that say anything about Borderlands versus BioShock? Or is it -- are there some other margin factors that allow you to generate a little bit more on a similar top line in the fourth quarter?", "Lainie Goldstein", "For the fourth quarter, which we're not giving guidance out for right now, I can tell you the big drivers will be BioShock Infinite, continued sales of NBA and Borderlands 2 and XCOM. There are some titles that we haven't announced yet. There's also going to be some significant marketing cost during the quarter for some titles for that quarter, as well as for future -- like, future periods right after that.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC", "So should I take that to mean that given a spring release of Grand Theft Auto, that we're going to see some significant marketing spend this year for a next year release for GTA?", "Lainie Goldstein", "I'm not going to share that level of detail at this time, but it definitely includes marketing for some of our key titles that would be coming in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia from Sterne Agee.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "A couple of things here. One, I wanted to see if you could give us a general idea of how many, say, AAA titles you might be thinking of in fiscal '14. I know you're not giving specific guidance. But just for all of us to be in the ballpark of how you're modeling outside of GTA V, of course you're going to have the annual titles, the NBA, et cetera. But could you at least, at a high level, give us that sense? And then on GTA V, what's the reason that you're not giving a specific date at this point? And logically, this is going to be in the first quarter of next fiscal. But is there any reason why you're not announcing a specific date today?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Arvind, for your questions. We have announced, for fiscal '14, XCOM coming from 2K Marin. And obviously, Rockstar has announced GTA V. And we said before, our release schedule includes announced and unannounced titles. We're not giving more color on fiscal '14 right now, but obviously, we will in the future as we would in the normal course. And with regard to the date for Grand Theft Auto V, spring 2013, we make those announcements based on what we think is best to market the title. And that we think that, that's the right way to describe it and we're just thrilled with the way that is shaping up.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Last question. On BioShock, you mentioned some of the reasons you're feeling stronger. Can you quantify the pre-order trends that you might be seeing with BioShock right now?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We're not giving out that information right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Creutz with Cowen and Company.", "Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give any color on how the Borderlands 2 Season Pass is progressing. If you're willing to give an attach rate, that'd be great. And then if you could discuss how the accounting for the digital revenue is going to flow through your P&L. I assume it's going to be amortized out over several quarters. But if you could just talk about that, that'll be helpful.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, like everything Borderlands and Borderlands-related, the Season Pass is phenomenally successful. Borderlands -- the first Borderlands really set the standard for how downloadable content could be released and how consumers would pay for it and enjoy it. And Borderlands 2 is seeing extraordinary success with its downloadable content, extraordinary success. So we feel just great about that. And Lainie will address the amortization issue.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Sure. For the past [indiscernible] free item. During this quarter, for GAAP purposes, it'll be recognized when it's delivered, which is in Q3. But for non-GAAP purposes, it's included in our numbers in this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie.", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "I was wondering if you could help us just understand the potential for the online Asia games going into next year. If you think about how should we rank order them or maybe think about how you're allocating marketing spend or are you involved in those discussions? Are you involved in putting marketing dollars to work there? And then, separately on GTA V, how differently should we think about the online potential there versus the online revenue of the last generation?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Ben. We are involved with all the key decisions on all of our titles. These are partnerships with the strongest local partners in the various local markets in which we operate. And they are real partnerships. So we're involved with every part of the decision-making. We wouldn't normally give details on how much we're spending on any given title. What is nice about online titles is that consumers are involved with the development in a way because you go to beta and you begin to see metrics from the title, and the online titles can be living entities -- living, breathing entities where what the consumers are doing can influence exactly what we're delivering to consumers before we actually go live. And then when we're actually live -- for example, we're now live in China as of the 24th -- we can still further iterate the title to meet consumers' needs and expectations to drive results. So how much we spend on marketing will reflect in no small measure consumer uptake of the title on an ongoing basis. So our expectations prior to launch wouldn't really be that valuable except to say the resources are there to support these titles as they roll out. And the initial indications from China are excellent and very encouraging. And we feel quite encouraged about what we're seeing coming out of Korea as well, and how that might translate to the rest of Asia. I think the second question was about the potential for digital content for Grand Theft Auto V, and it's way too early to discuss those plans. And of course, those discussions would come from Rockstar in the normal course. I think you can safely assume Rockstar, as the label that led the charge in downloadable content with Grand Theft Auto IV, I think you have every reason to believe, particularly because of the groundbreaking nature of the title itself and the multiplayer in the title, that there's going to be a lot of interesting stuff. But I'll leave that to Rockstar to announce.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Maybe a little drill down on -- to follow up to Doug's question in terms of the Borderlands pass, is it safe to assume that you're encouraged enough to say, \"Hey, we ought to do other pass type of programs with some of our other titles.\" And then, second question. Initial takes on your thoughts -- with the upcoming Wii U and the Microsoft SmartGlass products, how are you thinking about those and their impacts on the industry?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, we have actually had other season passes. Rockstar has had season passes, and we've been involved with them before and with varying degrees of success. It falls in the category of give consumers what they want at a fair price, and they'll come out for it. In the case of all of our downloadable contents across all of our labels, our goal is always to give consumers more than they pay for, so that when they show up -- when they keep the title as opposed to turning it in, and when they stay involved with the title, we're going to make that really worth their while. And that's true across our entire company. And I think Borderlands is a great example but certainly not the only example of that. Turning to your question about Wii U, we are supporting Wii U. We have NBA 2K coming out for Wii U on the 16th of November, and we're very excited about that. We'll see how it does. In terms of particular devices, I'm a huge believer in tablets. We've been very supportive of all things tablet and mobile-related and we think the world of Microsoft. So we assume they're going to figure it out. They always seem to.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Atul Bagga with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Atul Bagga - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions on China and Asia business. Can you give us some more color on NBA in China? How big -- what's the user base now? And what kind of monetization you're seeing in China? And second, based on your initiative in China, any plans for bringing NBA free-to-play in the Western market? And lastly, 2, 3 years from now, how do you see -- what could be the scale of this business in China, Korea, Asia?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Atul, for your questions. I can't really help you out. We don't typically give that level of detail and it would be premature to do so anyhow. Obviously, the China market is very, very significant in scale and free-to-play massive multiplayer games can do very well. At any given time, 10 or 20 of them are performing quite well in that marketplace, which creates a business opportunity vastly larger than anywhere else in the world. We have no -- we haven't discussed any plans to bring NBA online elsewhere. We have a great relationship with the NBA and we aim to delight consumers. I think whatever we do will be market-specific. I don't think you'd see a simple port of a title from one market to another. We would tailor anything we do to the needs of the particular market. And in terms of the scale, again, we haven't contemplated, and I think part of that is our approach in general to projections. This is a volatile business. We've said it before. In many instances, we've done better than expectations. In certain sad instances, we've missed our expectations. And we seem to be in a very good period right now and we like that. What we try not to do is -- we try to talk about what we're up to in a way that provides transparency, but not claim success until we actually deliver it. That's typically our approach. So the potential scale for any business in China that's successful is obviously enormous. The potential scale for our businesses there, it remains too early to say. We are trying very hard. We have great partners. We have great intellectual property. I am really proud of what we've been able to do from a standing start. I'm particularly proud because we did it with such limited risk. And that's very important as stewards of other people's capital and our own capital as well, since we're all shareholders here on the phone today. That's a crucial way to look at it and it is the way we look at it. But we try to do the best job we can and success will take care of itself.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.", "Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "As we're now looking ahead to the big launch next fiscal year, it brings up a question more generally, I think, whether there's any added pressure at the developer level to deliver key titles in advance of next-gen console launches, or even if that plays a part in how you're determining launch windows. And related to that, I wonder how we should think about the ramp-up in operating expenses over the next year on new platforms, if that might mitigate some of the shift in EPS that we see moving out of fiscal '13.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, in terms of timing. I think we are very mindful of the potential console transition. Of course, we rely on the information we receive from our hardware partners, as does the market, and we typically don't comment on it. We are very mindful of an upcoming transition. And the consumer behavior puts a fine point on that because as we head into the maturation of the cycle, we see tie ratios come down and you've seen what happens when that happens. It fits very well with our stated strategy, which is we try really hard to do only the highest-quality titles, the titles that consumers will show up for without regard to where you are in the hardware cycle. In that way, we can really benefit from a large installed base, which we already have and which will grow larger through the holidays for today's hardware. And we are -- while not immune, we are less at risk for the lower tie ratios because we're putting out must-have product. If we don't put out must-have product, we too will be hurt by the fact that people are more selective in their purchases as you head into the end of the cycle. Everyone in our company is mindful of that, not the least our creative teams. So we're all very, very mindful of that. In terms of your second question, we don't have a ramp-up of operating expenses for next generation. Like everyone else in the business, except one of our competitors, once we reach technical feasibility, we capitalize our software development. And at that point, it no longer hits our P&L until we release the title, at which point we amortize it in accordance with GAAP, as you know. So we wouldn't expect our operating expenses to increase. And I think I'll answer a question you didn't necessarily pose, which is -- has been posed, which is, do we believe the titles to be a whole lot more expensive to make for next gen? And the answer is, we do not. In many instances, we believe that it may be somewhat easier to make titles for next-gen, depending on how the technology comes together.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Just a question about the kind of general pipeline, not necessarily games-specific, but any color that you could provide as far as recurring seasonal strategy for your games? Obviously, you've got NBA 2K, and should we think about May as always including a major Rockstar title like L.A. Noire or Red Dead, or just in general how you're thinking about kind of the annual strategy for some of those games?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Well, as those of us -- those of you who have followed us for the last 5 years know, we aim to diversify the products of the company and to build up and diversify the release schedule, while staying true to the company's DNA of focusing on owned intellectual property and only the highest quality interactive entertainment. And the company has been extraordinarily successful at diversifying its release schedule. Since 2007, we've released at least one multimillion unit selling title, new intellectual property every year, sometimes more. At the same time, we do not have a strategy of annualizing our titles apart from our sports titles, which are naturally annualized. And the reason is that -- really several-fold. The first is, we want to put out the highest-quality titles and we think it's tough to do that annually, although one of our competitors in particular does a very good job of it. The second is that we think you preserve the lifespan of the intellectual property by limiting the releases to less than annually. And the third is that primarily, we're focused on quality and we put out a title when it's really great and really ready to go. That said, the release schedule is much more robust than it used to be and I expect that to continue to be the case. With regard to our label strategy, first of all, probably better that our labels should talk about it and they do. That said, again, we have -- the commonality we have across the company is to try to be the most creative shop, the most efficient shop, the most innovative shop. And I feel that while we can always do better, we're making strong progress across all 3 of those dimensions.", "Operator", "Mr. Zelnick, it appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.", "Strauss H.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Hank Diamond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you, sir. You may begin.", "Hank Diamond", "Good afternoon. Welcome and thank you for joining Take-Two\u2019s conference call to discuss its results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 ended December 31, 2012. Today\u2019s call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our Chief Operating Officer; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.", "Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including the company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012. These documents may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.", "And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that Take-Two delivered strong revenue growth, profits, and cash flow in the third quarter. The key drivers of our results were the record-breaking release of NBA 2K13, continued strong sales of Borderlands 2, the successful release of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and robust holiday sales of our catalog and digital delivered offerings. These results exceeded our outlook and demonstrate that the market for the highest quality interactive entertainment remains strong.", "NBA 2K13 has quickly become the most profitable release in the history of 2K sports. The title achieved record-setting first week sales and has already sold in nearly 4.5 million units worldwide. Considered by many to be the best release of NBA 2K yet, the title received massive critical acclaim, including more than 37 awards for sports game of the year or best games of 2012.", "The success of NBA 2K13 has been enhanced by sales of virtual goods and the introduction of our multi-platform NBA 2K Everywhere experience. These offerings allow consumers to immerse themselves further into the game\u2019s authentic basketball culture, both at home and on the go, and helped enable the franchise to generate its highest ever digitally delivered revenues. I\u2019d like to thank the teams at Visual Concepts and 2K for their stellar work and ongoing commitment to excellence.", "Building on its extraordinary launch in September, Borderlands 2 continues to expand its audience and remains on pace to become the highest selling title in 2K\u2019s history. It has also been the largest contributor to our digitally delivered revenue this year, driven both by strong sales of full-game downloads and high attach rates for the titles out on content, especially the Borderlands 2 season pass.", "With nearly 6 million units sold in to-date, an average Metacritic score of 90 and 73 end-of-year awards worldwide, Borderlands 2 has taken the already successful Borderlands franchise to another level, enabling it to become one of Take-Two\u2019s and the industry\u2019s most important long-term properties.", "Rounding out 2K\u2019s slate of successful new titles is XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Developed by the strategy experts at Firaxis Games, XCOM: Enemy Unknown reinvents one of the industry\u2019s most beloved franchises as a unique action strategy game. The title was one of the highest rated releases of 2012, achieving a near 90 Metacritic score, and winning an impressive 18 game of the year awards worldwide. As a result, Firaxis Games received the number one spot in Game Informer magazine\u2019s prestigious Developer of the Year rankings. A commercial success, XCOM: Enemy Unknown has generated particularly strong digitally delivered sales and is being supported with a popular add-on content campaign.", "With Borderlands 2, NBA 2K13 and XCOM: Enemy Unknown, 2K has delivered three of the 10 highest rated console releases of 2012 based on average Metacritic score. I\u2019d like to congratulate 2K on what\u2019s shaping up to be the label\u2019s best year ever both in terms of financial results and creative achievement.", "In addition to new releases, an important driver of our third quarter results was strong holiday demand for our popular catalog offerings. Catalog sales continue to be led by Rockstar Games iconic titles, Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption, which are still delighting consumers years after launch.", "Our diverse portfolio of catalog titles is a valuable asset that sets Take-Two apart from the competition and provides the company with a meaningful and relatively stable revenue and profit stream in virtually every period. Revenue from digitally delivered content more than tripled year-over-year and accounted for 23% of non-GAAP net revenue in the third quarter. The largest contributors were full game downloads and add-on content for our console and PC titles.", "We also benefited significantly from our growing portfolio of offerings from emerging platforms. During the third quarter, we released several successful titles for tablets and smartphones, representing a range of genres, including Grand Theft Auto Vice City, Borderlands Legends, NBA 2K13, and Herd, Herd, Herd.", "We firmly believe that interactive entertainment for mobile platforms, especially tablets, represents an important growth opportunity for our company and we have a number of exciting projects in the pipeline. We\u2019ll have more to say about these in the coming months.", "We also continued to make significant progress in our online projects for Asia, highlighted by the commercial launch of NBA 2K online on the Tencent portal in China. While still in the early stages, our Asian initiatives are already generating cash flow and represent meaningful, high-margin organic growth opportunities without considerable risk. Karl will have more to share about these efforts shortly.", "Take-Two\u2019s balance sheet is very strong. At quarter end, we had nearly $450 million in cash and no borrowing on our $100 million line of credit. We have ample capital to pursue a variety of investment opportunities and I am pleased to report that our board of directors has authorized the company to return a portion of that capital to shareholders through the repurchase of our own stock. This reflects our confidence in the company\u2019s ability to continue delivering growth, profits, and cash flow over time.", "As a result of our strong recent results and positive outlook for the remainder of the year highlighted by the upcoming release of BioShock Infinite on March 26, fiscal 2013 is poised to be a profitable year for Take-Two on a non-GAAP basis. Moreover, with Grand Theft Auto V launching on September 17, fiscal 2014 should be one of our best years ever with substantial revenue and earnings growth.", "Looking ahead, we have an extensive pipeline of unannounced titles in development. We also benefit from what we believe are the strongest assets in our industry, including world-class creative teams, a diverse portfolio of leading intellectual property, ample financial resources, and a sound focus on delivering the highest quality interactive entertainment. As a result, we are well positioned to capitalize on the full range of opportunities for our business, including the next generation of consoles when they come, emerging mobile and online platforms, and new business models. This is an extraordinarily exciting time for our industry, and I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about Take-Two\u2019s long-term outlook for success.", "I will now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Strauss. I\u2019d like to begin by giving an update on the progress we\u2019ve made with our online initiatives. Our strategy has been to focus on a select number of high-impact projects that have significant strategic and financial value to Take-Two while taking a balanced approach to managing risk. As with our core business, we believe that the strength of our IP and commitment to quality can create compelling commercial opportunities that will differentiate us from other players in the market.", "Given their attractive scale and growth characteristics, we have initially focused our efforts on the online gaming market in Asia where we have teamed up with the best-in-class partners whose expertise complements our own. Through each of these projects, we continue to develop deep knowledge of this growing market segment and are building a clear vision of how we can best leverage this expertise on a global scale.", "On October 24, NBA 2K online, our free-to-play online basketball game, launched on the Tencent portal in China. Co-developed by Visual Concepts and Tencent, the game is generating significant buzz in the region and user metrics are building momentum. We continue to tally gameplay based on consumer behavior and are very enthusiastic about the game\u2019s prospects to become a meaningful contributor to our profits. We plan to bring NBA 2K online to additional markets such as Taiwan and the Philippines. Pro Baseball 2K, our online baseball game, is being developed by Visual Concepts in partnership with Nexon Corporation in Seoul. The game entered closed beta in November in Korea and is on track for an open beta release this spring. And 2K\u2019s massively multi-player online game, Civilization Online, continues to make progress. Currently in development with our Firaxis Games studio and XL Games, which is led by renowned industry veteran Jake Song, Civilization Online is one of the most exciting and ambitious online game development initiatives in the region.", "I\u2019ll now discuss our announced pipeline of upcoming releases. On February 26, 2K will deliver a worldwide retail release of the Borderlands 2 add-on content pack, which funnels all of the digital content previously released for Borderlands 2 onto a single disc. The Borderlands 2 add-on content pack is a must-have for Borderlands fans who haven\u2019t already downloaded the content, adding hours of additional gameplay and exciting new features for the first two add-on campaigns, Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate\u2019s Booty and Mr. Torgue\u2019s Campaign of Carnage.", "On March 5, 2K Sports will release Major League Baseball 2K13 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The title will feature Tampa Bay Rays Cy Young award-winning pitcher David Price as cover athlete and will once again be supported with a perfect game challenge, 2K Sports\u2019 groundbreaking $1 million competition. We are pleased to enter into this new mutually beneficial agreement with various entities associated with Major League Baseball and we expect Major League Baseball 2K13 to contribute to the profitability of 2K Sports.", "From Irrational Games, the makers of the highest rated first-person shooter ever, BioShock Infinite is set to release March 26. Consumer enthusiasm and buzz for this launch continued to grow by the day and we expect the title to be a significant critical and commercial success. In addition to a series of special additions that are currently available for preorder, fans can purchase BioShock Infinite: Mind in Revolt, an e-book prequel to the title which will be available for the Amazon Kindle beginning February 12 and is free for those who preorder the game through Amazon.", "Also available free of charge to those who preorder BioShock Infinite is the Industrial Revolution Pack, which includes exclusive access to in-game gear items that boost combat abilities, bonus in-game currency, lock picks and the Industrial Revolution puzzle game on Facebook. For those fans who can\u2019t wait until March 26 to experience BioShock, 2K is currently offering the BioShock Ultimate Rapture Edition. For only $29.99, consumers get both BioShock and BioShock 2, add-on content for both games, which is valued at more than $40, and additional never-before-seen content.", "Rockstar Games is hard at work on the September 17 release of what gamers around the world are expecting to be the greatest GTA yet, Grand Theft Auto V. With the playable world bigger than Red Dead Redemption, GTA San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto IV combined, Grand Theft Auto V will offer an unprecedented level of immersion and exploration. And finally, 2K Marin continues to make progress on XCOM, its tactical squad-based shooter based on the beloved sci-fi franchise which is planned for release during fiscal year 2014.", "In closing, I\u2019d like to join Strauss in congratulating 2K on a phenomenal string of critically and commercially successful releases. We have a robust pipeline of announced and unannounced titles in development, and we are very optimistic about our long-term outlook for growth and profitability.", "Thanks. And I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I\u2019ll review our results for the third quarter and then discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013. All of the numbers I will be providing today are non-GAAP results from continuing operations, and all comparisons are year-over-year, unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, net revenue increased 71% to $405 million. This result exceeded our outlook range of $325 million to $375 million due to the breakout success of NBA 2K13, along with better than expected holiday sales of catalog and digitally delivered offerings. Catalog sales accounted for 22% of net revenue led by Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption.", "Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 244% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of net revenue. The largest contributors were offerings for the Borderlands franchise, in particular digital sales of Borderlands 2 and its add-on content, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, the Grand Theft Auto franchise and NBA 2K13.", "Gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 48.1% as this year\u2019s third quarter revenue mix was heavily weighted towards higher-priced new releases versus lower-priced catalog titles in last year\u2019s third quarter. Operating expenses were approximately $111 million, up about $32 million versus the prior year\u2019s third quarter. The principal drivers were higher marketing expenses to support NBA 2K13, XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Borderlands 2, as well as the upcoming release of BioShock Infinite.", "Interest and other expense increased slightly versus the prior year due primarily to the convertible notes that we issued in November 2011. And non-GAAP net income was $78.8 million, or $0.67 per diluted share as compared to $29 million or $0.27 per diluted share in fiscal third quarter 2012. This result significantly beat our outlook range, which projected non-GAAP net income of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income from continuing operations of $70.9 million or $0.66 per diluted share. Turning to some key items from our balance sheet, at December 31, 2012 as compared to September 30, 2012, our cash balance increased to $448.7 million.", "Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $94.2 million, primarily reflecting cash collected from receivables associated with the release of Borderlands 2 near the end of the second quarter and the releases of NBA 2K13 and XCOM: Enemy Unknown near the beginning of the third quarter. Inventory decreased to $29.7 million, reflecting the shipment of stock on hand for the releases of NBA 2K13 and XCOM: Enemy Unknown and replenishment orders of Borderlands 2. And software development costs and licenses decreased slightly to $274.1 million, reflecting the amortization of development costs for our third-quarter releases.", "Now I will review our financial outlook for the full year and fourth quarter fiscal 2013, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are increasing the low end of our outlook range for fiscal 2013 to reflect our strong recent business trends. We now expect non-GAAP revenue to range from $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion and non-GAAP net income to range from $0.05 to $0.20 per diluted share.", "Turning to the details of our full-year outlook, our expected revenue range assumes the on-time release of the titles we have announced today. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be approximately 25% from Rockstar and 75% from 2K. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect gross margins in the low 40s%. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 32% from fiscal 2012, primarily driven by higher marketing expense to support our new releases and the $15 million one-time contractual obligation recognized in the first quarter.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 21% of net revenue, using the midpoint of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $13 million, tax expense of about $5 million, and a share count of approximately 92 million, which includes 6 million of participating shares for our unvested stock-based compensation awards.", "Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect to deliver non-GAAP revenue ranging from $235 million to $285 million and non-GAAP net income ranging from $0.10 to $0.25 per diluted share. The majority of our revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to come from the release of BioShock Infinite, continued sales of NBA 2K13 and Borderlands 2, and the release of Major League Baseball 2K13. We expect fourth quarter gross margins in the mid to upper 40s%. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 23% from the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter, driven primarily by higher sales and marketing expense to support our recent and upcoming releases.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 19% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. Our fourth quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $3 million, tax expense of about $1 million, and a share count of approximately 120 million which includes 7 million of participating shares for unvested stock-based compensation awards and 26 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the if-converted method of accounting.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our recent business performance. Our better-than-expected results in the past two quarters and strong sales outlook have enabled us to overcome our first-quarter loss and some of the profits for the full year on a non-GAAP basis. We expect to deliver significant revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2014 and return to our shareholders over the long term.", "Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. Our strategy of delivering a select portfolio of the highest quality entertainment experiences continues to serve us well and remains one of the core values of our organization. We strive diligently for excellence with each release. And while that\u2019s not a guarantee for success, it has proven to be the predictable outcome. We continue to balance our creative passion with the rigor and discipline to deliver profits and value to our shareholders over time. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank our colleagues for their dedication and hard work and our shareholders for their continued support.", "And we\u2019ll now take your questions. Operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of James Hardiman, with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "James Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Hi, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my call and congrats on another great quarter. A couple of quick questions here. Talk a little bit about the move of Grand Theft Auto out of the spring window that you had previously talked about and into September. Maybe give us a little bit of the puts and takes, I guess, A, from a competitive window standpoint, and B, just given the fact that there\u2019s likely to be some next-generation consoles that are going to be coming out shortly after the September release, and ultimately how we should think about the strategy as you\u2019re trying to straddle sort of the current generation and the next generation.", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "Thanks James. Look, Grand Theft Auto stands alone. It\u2019s a unique property. And I think we\u2019re all extraordinarily excited about this title, and we think it\u2019s just going to blow people away frankly at a level I don\u2019t think anyone properly anticipates yet. And the reason that the title is coming out in September is because that\u2019s the time required to make sure it\u2019s everything everyone expects and then some.", "As it happens, I think September is a great window. The fact is it\u2019s a very open field that early in the fall. And as between late spring heading into the summer doldrums or early fall in an open field, that wasn\u2019t the reason that the title moved, but I think it happens to be a terrific time to launch it. And in terms of next-gen, look, as we all know, first of all, nothing has been announced yet, but assuming the consoles are coming when some of us at least think they are, that\u2019s obviously a very light installed base initially. And I\u2019m confident that this company is going to have an extraordinary array of offerings for next-gen when the time comes.", "James Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Great. And then just in terms of MLB 2K, although not recently, you\u2019ve quantified sort of the losses there in the past. Can you just, it sounds like, for the first time in a while, this is going to be a profitable release for you guys in terms of baseball. Can you help us with the comparison versus last year, how much money did you lose on that?", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "We previously announced the range of losses based on a legacy deal that we inherited. I think we said it was typically around $30 million a year. We also announced that that deal entered a sunset period and ultimately expired on its own terms. And the expectations about a new MLB release obviously reflect a new deal. And we are very optimistic and enthusiastic about both the creative elements of that and the financial elements of that.", "Karl Slatoff", "Yes, and as we said in our statements, we expect that title to contribute to the profitability of 2K Sports.", "James Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Very helpful. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.", "Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie", "", "Hey guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. A couple of questions and then a quick follow-up. For GTA V, how should we think about the post-sale revenue opportunities versus previous GTAs? And then separately, on full game downloads, obviously you are having some success there. Is that primarily from Steam and how do the economics differ for that versus physical retail distribution? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "In terms of post-sale revenue opportunities, to answer that, I\u2019d have to sort of outline what the expectations are, and I\u2019m going to leave it to Rockstar to talk about the game and what comes after. But just as I said, we couldn\u2019t be more enthusiastic. Our full-game downloads come from an array of places, including Steam, and in terms of our margins, we\u2019ve said this many times before, they are slightly higher for digitally distributed products, but not meaningfully so.", "Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie", "", "All right. And Strauss, if I could just follow up with one quick one, just high-level, when you think about the next-generation consoles, most likely they\u2019re going to be a lot more focused on media convergence at a higher level beyond just games. How does that impact you and the other publishers?", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "If that happens, and, look, the current consoles allow for all kinds of different media consumption. But if you\u2019re talking about the consoles becoming a set-top box, first of all, I\u2019d be happy to debate that endlessly and I could probably take both sides of the debate, as you know, Ben.", "But I think the answer is it doesn\u2019t really influence us. People have access to a full array of media choices as it is, and we\u2019re thrilled by that because the launch of new platforms is great for a company positioned the way we are positioned, and tablets have been great for us so far and mobile devices are great for us.", "Our job is to make the highest quality interactive entertainment and meet consumers where they are, wherever they are in the world, whatever device they want to consume our products on, and be flexible about the business models as well. So do I think that a broad-based offering from a next-gen console affects us? Only to the benefit of people who are more engaged with something they can watch high-quality entertainment on, from us it\u2019s probably a good thing.", "Karl Slatoff", "", "It\u2019s Karl. The other piece is it also creates a potential opportunity for the console to penetrate deeper than they are right now. If it\u2019s attractive as a broad media device, then there may be folks out there that pick it up not as a gaming machine, but in fact now they have access to a gaming machine, and it may encourage them to enter the gaming market as a consumer.", "Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie", "", "Great, thanks and good luck.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.", "Arvind Bhatia \u2013 Sterne Agee", "", "Thank you very much. I\u2019d like to add my congratulations as well. A couple of questions for you guys, first one on your basketball franchise, which continues to do better every year. And I heard you guys talk about your digital revenue there. Is there any way for you guys to help us understand what kind of attach rate you\u2019re getting, whether it\u2019s in dollars or other ways to think about, so we can understand the opportunity beyond just the disc sale. And then similarly, on Borderlands 2, I think you said that was your largest digital contributor. Just generally trying to get a sense of the attach rate beyond the disc? Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "Arvind, thank you. We don\u2019t actually talk about attach rates, and ARPUs and the like. Our focus here on a creative basis is what drives the organization, and every year the folks at Visual Concepts try to make basketball better and this year is almost highly rated basketball game we\u2019ve ever had with a 90 Metacritic score and we sold in 4.5 million units.", "And the unit sales reflect the fact that we are delighting consumers. We\u2019ve offered the opportunity to have a multiplatform experience on the go and for the first time the opportunity is to make in-game purchases. All those things make consumers happy. Happy consumers spend more money. We make more money. It\u2019s a virtuous circle.", "We tend to think of it that way, we tend to think of it less as a specific numeric attach rate, although of course we could back into that figure. But it doesn\u2019t really tell us very much about what we\u2019re trying to do around here. The same thing with Borderlands. We are putting out digital add-on content because that\u2019s what consumers want. We try to price it fairly.", "We want everyone\u2019s experience of one of our games to be one where they thought they got more value than the value they paid for and that they\u2019re always happy. And that\u2019s why Metacritic says for the past four years we\u2019ve had the number one quality rating among any third-party publisher. That\u2019s why we have the results we have, and that\u2019s why we have $450 million of cash on our balance sheet.", "Arvind Bhatia \u2013 Sterne Agee", "", "One quick follow-up. This kind of ties into where we are in the cycle, et cetera. You\u2019ve got a great property coming up in March in BioShock. I\u2019m wondering, as you review the retail landscape in the next three to six months and what you expect there, has your expectation for BioShock changed at all? What are you seeing in terms of the preorder activity and how reliable that may or may not be at this point in the cycle? Just for planning and modeling purposes, how are you thinking about BioShock? That would be helpful.", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "Look, the retail landscape is interesting. If you go back just nine months, things were looking pretty bleak and there were a lot of people just saying the industry is in decline. And we denied that that was the case. It\u2019s certainly not our view. Our view was the industry had had some disappointments, and frankly we\u2019ve had some disappointments.", "This is an industry that, like all entertainment businesses, relies upon hits for its health and well-being. And it\u2019s further complicated by the nature of the hardware console cycle. And we are heading into the late stages of that cycle. All that said, there\u2019s a huge install base. And you give people what they want, they come out for it. This quarter is living proof of that. BioShock Infinite is shaping up really well. The buzz is extraordinary. The title has already won a lot of awards. We have the highest expectations for it.", "Arvind Bhatia \u2013 Sterne Agee", "", "Appreciate it guys. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Ernst \u2013 Hudson Square Research", "", "Yes. Good evening. Thanks for taking my call. A couple of questions about digital. One is, in the past, you\u2019ve said that it really is the margins aren\u2019t all that different. And I\u2019m wondering, given the margin progression you\u2019ve had lately and the success you\u2019ve had in digital, what the margin profile of digital overall is looking for the business versus package today.", "And then two, as it relates to Borderlands and wouldn\u2019t more broadly in digital what opportunities you have in creating more of an ongoing relationship with your customers, certainly fans of GTA or fans of Borderlands have affinity to that game but do you have an opportunity in there with things like season pass or others in having more of an ongoing either relationship of building relationship versus just kind one off downloads? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein", "", "Daniel, It\u2019s Lainie. I\u2019m just going to answer your first question about digital on the margins. So we have said before that we see that the margins are pretty much in line with what we see at retail margins. But from time to time depending on the title, if the title\u2019s a hit and there is a tremendous amount of volume for the title, depending on what the cap software was to develop the download or the marketing cost we can see a bit of a better margin than the retail, but overall in the grand scheme its pretty much in line. As a percentage of revenue it seems to be a bit stronger because of some of the deals that we have with third parties and how we\u2019re capturing the revenue on this top line.", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "Yeah. Your point about on ongoing relationship with consumers is a good one, because just a few short years ago we\u2019d put out a big release and that was pretty much it, then you\u2019d put out your catalog offerings. This company had a faded strategy to build up its catalog offerings based on the quality of what we do, and I think pound for pound we have the best selling titles per SKU in the industry which reflects our quality. Then we were also a standard bearer in delivering our content for our titles with the launch of Grand Theft Auto IV and the downloadable content packs that came along with that. And you\u2019re wise to point out Borderlands because Borderlands itself has been a standard bearer for add-on content delivered digitally, well done.", "Does that mean that these games will transition into a situation where you are constantly putting out new episodes and that bridges you from release to release? We don\u2019t see the business shaping up that way but it does mean that the life cycle is extended greatly and we\u2019ll continue to experiment with what this means creatively for consumers. I also think as you see tablets roll out and become the more and more important game platform that episodic treatment of games may become much more relevant for tablets given the perceived price point limitations for a tablet.", "But we\u2019ll see if it turns out that way. What you are hearing though is we are not role based, we are flexible. We will try anything that delights consumers as long as it fits within the rubric of the very highest quality releases in the industry.", "Daniel Ernst \u2013 Hudson Square Research", "", "Great. Thanks for the color. And just one other follow-up on next-gen, what you\u2019re thinking about development budgets having to develop for both the current gen and the next-gen on some key titles. So in the sports titles, or annual type of events is that going to strain development budgets heading into next fiscal year? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "We don\u2019t have any reason to believe our development budgets will change significantly and if anything I would say we\u2019ve become group wide much tighter in terms of how we spend our money. There\u2019s been a challenge, a stated challenge for us and we are very, very focused on it. So we can\u2019t say specifically, but no, we don\u2019t expect to see a meaningful change and what it cost us to release these top quality products.", "Daniel Ernst \u2013 Hudson Square Research", "", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson Junior with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.", "Andrew Connor \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Hi guys. Great quarter. This is Andrew Connor on for Mike. I had a high level question. The installed base today is obviously very large and it appears that the 360 and the PS3 are going to continue to be major influencers in the space. Similar to the prior cycle transition, I\u2019m sure there will be lots of cross-generational software for the next couple of years post-launch. But my question is really how do you go about developing for both current and next-generation consoles, when clearly the development teams want to be innovating, and yet there is a trade-off where we\u2019ll have to be accommodating to the current installed base? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "Well, you\u2019re right, navigating this part of the cycle is a challenge. I\u2019m actually really pleased with the way we\u2019ve done it. Obviously, we\u2019ve released our major release schedule for the coming periods and we\u2019re excited about that. We really can\u2019t talk much about next-gen because we\u2019re not the ones to talk about it first. But rest assured that, around here, we think as far ahead as we possibly can, as do our creative teams.", "And everyone is really excited about the possibilities and we\u2019re working diligently on them. And I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019ll navigate the transition when it does occur successfully. I\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll repeat it, there are four elements that you need to succeed in these transition periods. And that these transition periods present enormous challenges for companies that don\u2019t have them and enormous benefits there for those who do. They are strong owned intellectual property, strong creative teams in-house, strong technology and a strong balance sheet. We have all four.", "Andrew Connor \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with National Alliance Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Hickey \u2013 National Alliance Securities", "", "Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Strauss, historically, you\u2019ve kind of been, not to put words in your mouth, but hesitant to believe in the Facebook market. And now that it looks like Facebook is kind of resetting towards an interest in developing something for the core gamers, and given that\u2019s your development expertise, I was curious if you\u2019d kind of reset how you think about that and if you\u2019re developing any games, core games, for Facebook.", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "No, I wasn\u2019t skeptical about Facebook. I was skeptical about Zynga to be exact. And I remain highly skeptical about Zynga. Facebook is an incredible platform serving hundreds of millions of people, a great promotional platform and potentially a great game platform. We\u2019ve happily done business with Facebook. I assume we\u2019ll keep doing so.", "Mike Hickey \u2013 National Alliance Securities", "", "And then for next-gen consoles, I\u2019m hearing that the portability of current-gen is going to be a lot easier. And so I think this question has been kind of dragged into the dirt here, but just philosophically, you see Bungie looking to do a dual generation launch, given how close they are to next-gen machines.", "And I mean, it\u2019s pretty obvious that once the next-gen is announced from Sony, which is likely February 20 and Microsoft probably in April, that all things being equal, even as great as GTA is there\u2019s going to be kind of a natural demand kickback on current-gen software as people save up dollars and excitement for next-gen.", "So not to get any specific on data, necessarily on a particular game, but all things being equal, if you had the opportunity to do a dual-generation launch, would you see that as a net benefit or is it too arbitrary to even know?", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "Mike, let\u2019s have a little gentlemen\u2019s bet. But there is not one gamer who\u2019s going to sit it out of Grand Theft Auto V hoping that something down the road is going to come along that\u2019s better. Grand Theft Auto V is going to blow everyone away, and it will be in the market in September.", "In terms of strategy around current-gen and next-gen, we have to wait for the announcements. And as I said, look, we\u2019re always looking over our shoulder. I\u2019m a big believer that arrogance is the enemy of continued success. But we are planning as well as we can, and we think we are extremely well positioned. And our creative teams have a burning desire to bring consumers what they want, when they want it, and I\u2019m convinced we\u2019re going to keep doing that.", "Mike Hickey \u2013 National Alliance Securities", "", "Okay. And the last question, if you would, there is kind of nontraditional approaches to controlling the living room from a games perspective and maybe outside of that, but you have Oya that is looking to kind of do a free-to-play DROID model that\u2019s expected to drop in June. You have Bowles that is looking to kind of bridge the PC to TV market. You have a lot of people, intelligent people, trying to create effective mainstream solutions from the tablet market to the TV. I\u2019m just curious, when you look at these different trends, emerging technology trends, relative to your development expertise, where do you see the best opportunity?", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "All of the above. Our opportunities, we obviously go where the audiences are. So in certain instances, we are not going to spend the resources unless there is a demonstrated audience. When you have the top intellectual property in the business, you can afford to be a little reticent. The one thing we wouldn\u2019t do would be support everything at enormous expense to our P&L and our balance sheet without knowing where the audience is going.", "But we\u2019ve always been willing to support meaningful initiatives very early on, even when there wasn\u2019t a big installed base. And I imagine that selectively we\u2019ll do that. What typically happens is our creative teams look at the opportunity and they weigh the cost and the complexity of supporting the platform with the potential audience and the economic opportunity, as well as the creative opportunity and whether it turns them on or not. Our stated strategy though is not to be rule-based, to be flexible, and to be wherever the consumers are.", "Mike Hickey \u2013 National Alliance Securities", "", "Great. Thanks guys. Good luck.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Fitzgerald \u2013 Jefferies", "", "Thanks. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing any differentiation around engagement or purchase prevalence across kind of iOS or Android or smartphones or tablets? And then a second question in terms of timing on MBA expansion into Taiwan and Philippines, how should we think about that? Maybe a little color. Is it a meaningful coding experience or is it more market timing? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Just to clarify, you\u2019re asking a question about whether we see different demographics across these different tablets?", "Brian Fitzgerald \u2013 Jefferies", "", "Yes, maybe indirectly or I guess do you find a tablet guy purchasing more than somebody else or an Android guy purchasing less than an iOS guy?", "Strauss Zelnick", "", "We haven\u2019t seen a meaningful difference as yet, but it\u2019s kind of swamped by the various growth factors and different territories of the different devices and also swamped by the fact that we don\u2019t put out everything for every platform simultaneously. So, I\u2019m not sure we can read it that well. We\u2019re still really in early-stage experimentation mode. And I\u2019m sorry, your second question? We haven\u2019t really talked about how we\u2019re rolling out in other territories. We do have the rights and the ability to roll out in other territories. And we are always balancing the opportunity with the risk. It\u2019s still early days, but we are exceedingly encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in Asia, and we are now generating revenue and cash flow from Asia.", "Brian Fitzgerald \u2013 Jefferies", "", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Saul Ponedd \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, this is Saul Ponedd for Edward Williams. I was just wondering. Can you provide some more color on how NBA 2K online is doing in Asia, perhaps how it\u2019s tracking or what timeframe you were considering it to be coming to profit, you know how the economics differ in other regions?", "Karl Slatoff", "Hi, it\u2019s Karl. As we said in our comments, we\u2019re very pleased with how the metrics are tracking NBA in China right now on the Tencent platform. In terms of how fast we\u2019re going to be rolling it out other territories, et cetera, we really don\u2019t have anything else to say about it at this point. But like we said before, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made together with VC and Tencent.", "Saul Ponedd \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "Okay. And then just how did the economics differ just between like the various regions? Is it...", "Karl Slatoff", "", "On the NBA game?", "Saul Ponedd \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "Yes, the online game?", "Karl Slatoff", "", "Okay. We are only in China right now. So I would say there\u2019s no differentiation because we are only in one market.", "Saul Ponedd \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "Okay. And then just final question on digital. Can you just remind me, do you recognize the gross amount or the net amount?", "Lainie Goldstein", "", "We recognize the net amount.", "Saul Ponedd \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Phil Boyer with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Phil Boyer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Hi guys. I just had a quick question. On the digitally delivered, you guys mentioned it was 23% of net revenue. I was wondering if you can give me any color on where most of that is coming from?", "Lainie Goldstein", "", "Most of it is coming from Borderlands 2 in this quarter and then also from our catalog.", "Phil Boyer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay.", "Lainie Goldstein", "", "And also NBA 2K13.", "Phil Boyer \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Mr. Zelnick, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.", "Strauss Zelnick", "I just want to thank everyone for attending today\u2019s call. Obviously we are very encouraged by the results we have released we are excited about in BioShock Infinite, we are very focused on that. And on keeping the momentum going on in our digitally delivered offerings and our catalogue offerings and of course we are all immensely excited about next year\u2019s releases, including but not limited to Grand Theft Auto V. So it\u2019s a good time for us. We are very encouraged, very optimistic. And again thank you for joining us.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

Thank you, Mr. Diamond, you may begin.", "Henry Diamond", "Good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 ended March 31, 2013.", "Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws.

Zelnick", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today.  I'm pleased to report that Take-Two delivered strong revenue growth and solid non-GAAP earnings for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013. These results were driven by robust demand for our new releases, catalog titles and expanding portfolio of digitally delivered offerings.", "While many in our sector have faced serious challenges, we continue to benefit from a focus on our core strategic values: creativity, innovation and efficiency.", "During the past year, our world-class creative teams released some of the industry's most captivating and groundbreaking entertainment experiences. Our unwavering commitment to quality enabled our titles to attract and delight audiences time and time again. This results in near-term hits and sustainable catalog value, which create ongoing profits and long-term returns for our shareholders.", "Fiscal 2013 began with the release of Rockstar Games Max Payne 3. This gritty action-packed third-person shooter received excellent reviews and introduced multiplayer Gameplay for the first time to this popular franchise. The title delivered Rockstar's signature cinematic style of action and storytelling while redefining the genre, with revolutionary advances in targeting and animation.  Max Payne 3 is sold in over 4 million units to date and continues to attract new fans.", "Borderlands 2 remains on track to become the highest selling release in the history of 2K, with approximately 6 million units sold in to date and counting. The title received fantastic reviews, yielding a 90 average Metacritic score and won more than 55 editorial awards. Borderlands 2 was the largest contributor to our digitally delivered revenue last year based on high demand for the game's innovative downloadable add-on content, as well as full game downloads.", "NBA 2K13 won more than 38 editorial honors, including numerous Sports Game of the Year awards, and quickly became the most profitable sports title in the history of 2K. This is the 12th consecutive year in which we delivered the topped ranked NBA simulation game and the third consecutive release of the franchise to sell in more than 5 million units. The performance of NBA 2K13 has been enhanced by record digital sales for the franchise, including virtual goods. The team at Visual Concepts continues to raise the bar for excellence with each annual release of the series.", "XCOM: Enemy Unknown reimagines one of the industry's most beloved franchises, as a unique turn-based strategy game. Developed by 2K's Firaxis Games studio, XCOM: Enemy Unknown was one of the highest-rated releases of 2012, achieving a near 90 average Metacritic score and winning an impressive 18 Game of the Year awards. The title has generated particularly strong digitally delivered sales, and it's opened the door for future brand extensions, which Karl will discuss.", "We wound up the fiscal year with the eagerly anticipated launch of BioShock Infinite, the highest-rated release of 2013 so far, with a terrific 94 average Metacritic score. Critics have universally praised BioShock Infinite, with the Associated Press calling it \"a new standard for video game storytelling\" and NBC News declaring it \"a masterpiece.\" The title is already a commercial success with over 3.7 million units sold in to date and record first-month sell-through for the franchise. BioShock Infinite will be supported by an array of downloadable add-on content. And we're already seeing solid attach rates for its Season Pass.", "I'd like to congratulate Ken Levine and the team at Irrational Games, as well as the team at 2K for turning this launch into a major tentpole event for our company and the industry.", "I'd like to take a moment to commend everyone at 2K for consecutively launching 4 of the past year's most critically acclaimed titles. That's simply an outstanding achievement. It bears noting that since its founding in 2005, 2K has flourished to become a home for some of our industry's top talent and most important franchises. Moreover, 2K's success has played an integral role in our diversification, growth and ability to deliver consistent profits.", "Our fiscal 2013 results also benefited from robust sales of catalog titles, particularly Rockstar Games' iconic Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption, as well as the profitable release of Major League Baseball 2K13. In addition to delivering stronger financial results, we continue to execute our strategic objectives during the past year. We further diversified our business across distribution channels, expanded our offerings for new platforms and geographies and enhanced our portfolio of industry-leading franchises.", "We remain keenly judicious and analytical in our approach, mindfully balancing increased risk with increased reward. To that end, we expanded aggressively our digitally delivered offerings for both traditional and emerging platforms, which are contributing significantly to our growth and profitability.", "Most of our new releases are now available for digital download on the day of launch, and all of our fiscal 2013 AAA releases are being supported by innovative downloadable add-on content.", "We're also now receiving high-margin revenue from in-game purchases of virtual goods, both in front-line titles such as NBA 2K13 and in mobile and online titles, many of which are free-to-play. During fiscal 2013, we generated record digitally delivered revenue, which accounted for 22% of our total.", "We broadened our mobile slate with core releases including Max Payne Mobile, Borderlands Legends, NBA 2K13 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Casual releases such as Herd, Herd, Herd and GridBlock and our first mobile social game for Japan, NBA 2K All Stars.", "We continue to believe that interactive entertainment for mobile platforms, especially tablets, represents an important emerging growth opportunity. And we've numerous projects in our pipeline, some of which Karl will discuss later.", "We've also made substantial progress developing online games for Asian markets. NBA 2K Online, developed in partnership with Tencent, launched commercially in China in October. Usage and player engagement with the game continue the game momentum. And according to QQ Games, it's now among the top 10 most played PC games in Internet caf\u00e9s in China.", "Pro Baseball 2K, developed in partnership with Nexon Corporation, launched commercially in Korea on May 2. The game offers an authentic Korean Pro Baseball simulation experience based on the MLB 2K engine.", "And finally, we revealed that the massively multiplayer online game that 2K is developing in partnership with XLGAMES is based on our successful Civilization franchise. Civilization Online will release initially in Korea, and production is being led by online gaming luminary, Jake Song. It's one of the most exciting and ambitious online game development initiatives in the region.", "We're highly enthusiastic about the opportunity for our online projects to augment our core business with a relatively stable, higher-margin revenue stream over time.", "In February, we acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to publish the popular WWE franchise across all major platforms and distribution channels. We believe there's an untapped opportunity to enhance further the performance of this profitable franchise by leveraging 2K's superb development and marketing resources, which have made our NBA 2K brand an annual hit. WWE is already contributing to our results with WWE 13.", "I'm pleased to note that 2013 marks the 20th anniversary of Take-Two. And today, our company stands in a stronger position than at any other time in our history. Although we've come very far, we believe that some of our most successful times are ahead.", "Interactive entertainment is a cyclical business. Our industry appears poised to enter an exciting growth period, driven by the upcoming launches of the next-generation consoles, as well as the increasing popularity of emerging mobile and online platforms. With our world-class creative teams, diverse portfolio of the highest quality franchises in the business, cutting edge technology and strong balance sheet, Take-Two has all of the assets required to capitalize on these opportunities.", "Fiscal 2014 promises to be one of our best years ever, highlighted by the upcoming launch of Grand Theft Auto V in September. We also have an extraordinary pipeline of titles in development for next-generation platforms, including groundbreaking new intellectual property and releases from our proven franchises. As a result, our current outlook is to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis in fiscal 2015 and for the foreseeable future.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by giving an update on our recent releases and development pipeline for fiscal year 2014. As mentioned earlier, mobile gaming is an area of increased focus for our company. These offerings generally require much smaller development teams, budgets and timelines than console releases. However, the passion and desire we require of our creative talent to captivate audiences remains a constant.", "I'd now like to highlight some of our recent and upcoming mobile releases. Firaxis Games, 2K's renowned studio behind our Civilization and XCOM franchises, has been hard at work on several new titles for the iOS-enabled mobile devices. The first is Haunted Hollow, a free-to-play strategy title, which can be enjoyed by families, strategy buffs and horror enthusiasts alike. The game launched on May 2, and the response has been very positive, with game sites such as Kotaku raving that \"2K and Firaxis want their players to party.\"", "Second is Sid Meier's Ace Patrol, an original title created by the legendary game designer himself, which immerses players in strategic World War I air combat scenarios.  This free-to-play title released on May 9  and offers the high-quality 3D strategy experience that players expect from Sid Meier and Firaxis. Anticipation for the title was high, with Wall Street Journal noting that Ace Patrol marks one of Take-Two's \"biggest steps in its effort to become an influential player in the mobile market.\"", "And finally, we will release our critically acclaimed console and PC title, XCOM: Enemy Unknown for iOS this summer. XCOM: Enemy Unknown was one of the highest-rated releases of 2012, and the iOS version will offer a full experience to mobile gamers. We'll have more mobile titles to discuss in the coming months.", "Turning to our console and PC releases. This year, we'll have several new downloadable add-on content offerings from Borderlands 2 and BioShock Infinite that will further immerse players in these incredibly popular and successful titles. Consumers who took advantage of our Season Pass savings will be amongst the first to expand their experiences in Pandora and Columbia with even more Gameplay content.", "To date, we have announced new content launching for Borderlands 2 tomorrow and on June 25.", "Building on the success of Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods & Kings Expansion Pack, which was released last summer, 2K will release Sid Meier's Civilization V: Brave New World on July 9. This second expansion pack for the award-winning Civilization V will provide new depth and replayability through the introduction of international trade, as well as a focus on culture and diplomacy.", "On August 20, 2K Marin, the studio behind BioShock 2, will expand our successful XCOM franchise with the release of the Bureau: XCOM Declassified. Set in 1962, at the height of the Cold War, this third-person tactical shooter tells the story of the founding of the top-secret XCOM organization. We're very excited about Marin's vision for this title, the result of which is a narrative-driven experience that will challenge players unlike any other third-person tactical shooter.", "Turning to what many in our industry are predicting to be the biggest and most important launch of the current console generation, Grand Theft Auto V is on track for its planned worldwide release launch on September 17. Rockstar Games recently released 3 new character trailers to an overwhelmingly positive response from both fans and media.", "In addition, 2 weeks ago, the game was demoed for press, and resulting converse has been exponential -- I'm sorry, exceptional. It's worth noting that people are responding not only to the game's vast size and scope but also to its innovative 3-character structure and heist mission design, which offer immense opportunities for game play and storytelling that should raise the bar, not only for this franchise but for all interactive entertainment.", "Rockstar Games continues to prove that they have the passion and scale to take meaningful creative risks with one of the world's biggest entertainment brands.  We're confident that the team at Rockstar North is creating something genuinely special, and look forward to the game's release in September.", "On October 1, NBA 2K14 will return to the hardwood and Visual Concepts is poised to, once again, raise the bar in sports gaming with the #1 basketball video game franchise for more than a decade. In October 29, 2K will put gamers in the squared circle with some of biggest names in sports entertainment today, for the launch of WWE 2K14. The title promises to build on the successful franchise, which we recently acquired.", "I'd now like to take a moment to discuss the upcoming E3 show in Los Angeles. This year, our labels will not have a booth on the show floor. Both Rockstar Games and 2K have instead decided to focus their marketing and PR efforts on a series of events throughout the spring and summer. Our team, however, will be present at the show, and we look forward to seeing many of you there.", "As stated earlier by Strauss, today, Take-Two is better positioned for consistent profitability than in any other time in its history. We've built one of the strongest intellectual property portfolios in our industry, including 9 franchises with individual titles that have sold in 5 million units or more.", "Fueled by our existing portfolio of franchises and ongoing initiatives to develop new intellectual property, we have an extensive pipeline of unannounced core titles in development for multiple platforms, including next-gen consoles. We plan to support many of these releases with downloadable add-on content and other incremental revenue opportunities.", "In addition, we have numerous titles in development for mobile and online platforms, which range from core gaming to more casual and social experiences. And finally, we have our online initiatives in Asia, which are expected to contribute growing revenue and profits in 2014.", "In closing, I'd like to join Strauss in congratulating and thanking all of our employees for delivering such fantastic titles and results this year. We are highly optimistic about our long-term outlook and are confident that our best days are still yet to come.", "Thanks, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013, and then discuss our outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2014.", "All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP results from continuing operations, and all comparisons are year-over-year, unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurement.", "Starting with our results for the fourth quarter, net revenue increased 105% to $303.1 million. This exceeded our outlook range of $235 million to $285 million due to the blockbuster release of BioShock Infinite, along with the strong sales of catalog titles and digitally delivered offerings.", "Catalog sales accounted for 25% of net revenue, led by Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption and Sid Meier's Civilization V. Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 192% year-over-year and accounted for 27% of net revenue. The largest contributors were offerings for Borderlands 2, BioShock Infinite, the Grand Theft Auto franchise and NBA 2K13.  In addition, continuing sales of NBA 2K13 and Borderlands 2, along with the release of Major League Baseball 2K13, also contributed meaningfully to our fourth quarter results.", "Gross margin increased 27.7 percentage points to 49.6%, due primarily to lower license expense as a result of the expiration of our previous contract with Major League Baseball. Operating expenses were approximately $105 million, up about $22 million. The principal driver was higher marketing expenses to support BioShock Infinite.", "Interest and other expense increased to $2.9 million, due primarily to the absence of a gain-on-sale recorded in the prior year's fiscal fourth quarter. And non-GAAP net income was $42.9 million or $0.38 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $50.9 million or $0.60 per share in fiscal fourth quarter 2012.", "This result significantly exceeded our outlook range of $0.10 to $0.25 per share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income from continuing operations of $21.2 million or $0.23 per share.", "Turning now to our results for the full year. Net revenue increased 48% to $1.2 billion. This significant growth was driven primarily by our robust slate of fiscal 2013 releases led by Borderlands 2, NBA 2K13, BioShock Infinite and Max Payne 3, along with higher sales of catalog titles from Grand Theft Auto franchise and record sales of digitally delivered content.", "Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 148% to a record $264 million, the largest contributors were offerings of Borderlands 2, the Grand Theft Auto franchise and NBA 2K13. Gross margin was 42.2%, up 5.6 percentage points from prior year. The increase is due to lower license expense, resulting from the expiration of our previous contract with Major League Baseball, along with the strong performance of our fiscal 2013 releases.", "Operating expenses were approximately $467 million, up about $150 million over the prior year. The principal driver was higher marketing expenses to support our larger slates of fiscal 2013 releases.", "Interest and other expense increased to $12.5 million due to the full year impact of the convertible notes that we issued in November of 2011 and the absence of a gain on sale recorded in the prior year. And non-GAAP net income was $33.1 million or $0.36 per diluted share, as compared to net loss of $59.4 million or $0.71 per share in fiscal 2012.", "On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $31.2 million or $0.36 per share.", "As previously disclosed, both our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the year include a $15 million negative impact from a onetime contractual obligation, which was recorded in the first quarter.", "Turning to some key items from our balance sheet. At March 31, 2013, as compared to December 31, 2012, our cash balance decreased to $402.5 million. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $189.6 million, primarily reflecting receivables associated with the release of BioShock Infinite near the end of the fourth quarter. Inventory was relatively flat at $30.2 million, and software development costs and licenses increased to $294.2 million, reflecting the development efforts around our pipeline of upcoming releases.", "Now I'll review our financial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2014, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. Starting with the full year, we expect to deliver significant growth in both revenue and earnings driven by the launch of Grand Theft Auto V, which is planned for September 17, 2013. Our initial outlook is for net revenue to range from $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion and net income to range from $2.05 to $2.30 per share.", "Turning to the details of our full year outlook. Our expected revenue range assumes the on-time release of the titles we have planned for launch during fiscal 2014. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 65% from Rockstar and 35% from 2K. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 50% United States and 50% international. We expect gross margins in the low 40s.", "Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 3%, primarily due to additional staffing at our studios to support our release schedule. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 15% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $12.5 million, tax expense of about $11 million and fully diluted shares of approximately 122 million, which includes 8 million of participating shares for our unvested stock-based compensation awards and 26 million shares, representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the if-converted method of accounting.", "Turning to the first quarter. We expect non-GAAP revenue to range from $100 million to $125 million and non-GAAP net loss to range from $0.55 to $0.70 per share. The majority of our revenue in the first quarter is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto franchise, BioShock Infinite, NBA 2K13 and Borderlands 2.", "We expect first quarter gross margins in the mid to upper 40s.", "Total operating expenses are expected to decrease by approximately 26% from the prior year's first quarter, driven primarily by lower sales and marketing expense and the absence of the $15 million onetime contractual obligation recognized in the first quarter last year.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 40% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range.", "Our first quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $3 million, tax expense of about $3 million and a share count of approximately 87 million.", "In closing, we are pleased to deliver 3 consecutive quarters of strong revenue growth and profits. These results enable us to overcome our first quarter loss and deliver solid non-GAAP earnings for the full year. I would like to join Strauss and Karl in congratulating our employees on their outstanding creative and operational achievements, which make our financial results possible.", "We will continue to balance our creative drive with a disciplined approach to operational efficiency and capital allocation to drive long-term returns for our shareholders.", "Thank you. Now I turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our employees for their stellar work in delivering outstanding results this past year and for setting the stage for I believe will be one of the most exciting chapters in our history.", "And to our shareholders, I want to express our gratitude for your continued support and belief in our vision.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "I'm just -- I know you don't like to talk about specific games. But if you can look in the aggregate, what type of uplift or the overall percentage of revenue that you are getting from digital components of games like for Borderlands and BioShock and all the other top games, the contributions you're getting from those -- from the digital side there or maybe also the mobile uplift as well, too?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, we don't disclose the breakout. We do talk about the fact that digitally delivered revenue in the quarter was 27% of our net revenues. So it's quite meaningful. But the reason that it's not something we cover is it's really not relevant. Our view is that we should make our products available to consumers wherever they are, however they want to receive it, without regard to platforms. And whether something's delivered on a disc or ephemerally, is really a detail and should be a detail for us. We want to be where the consumers are.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie.", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "Three quick questions for you. One, thank you for the guidance post FY '14, I'm talking about FY '15 and beyond, I think that's very helpful. I was wondering if you could just walk through what gives you the confidence to be able to give that guidance now? And the second question is something I don't think we've talked about a lot publicly, but that's your cash balance. Historically, it's never been that big. I was wondering if you could talk about what that cash balance may look like by the end of FY '14? And any potential plans for that cash? And then finally, the 1Q guidance, relatively low, especially given that BioShock had a great release. I'm wondering why the 1Q guidance might not be a little higher given potential reorders on BioShock?", "Lainie Goldstein", "So Ben, in terms of the foreseeable future, our outlook is based on a multi-year plan, which currently projects ongoing profitability for the company. And then in addition, our development pipeline, which extends out even further, gives us confidence in our ability to be consistently profitable over the long term. So that's really what backs that number up. In terms of our cash balance, we don't share our projections or our cash flow going forward. But we do plan to be cash positive this year, as you can see by our earnings. In terms of the use of the cash, it's really in line with how we look at our cash balance now. And we look for our opportunities for acquisitions, investing in our current pipeline or other titles that make sense for us, as well as in Asia, some of our online titles there. And then we also would look to do -- we announced the share repurchase and if that makes sense for us, we definitely would do that as well. Your third question for me?", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "Just the Q1 guide just seems a little bit low relative to how strong the quarter ended in particularly with BioShock, I'm wondering why Q1 guidance couldn't be higher given potential for BioShock reorders and some other things that are going on in the quarter?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, we definitely do have BioShock reorders scheduled for the quarter and the lifetime units for that title. We definitely -- we have increased our expectations for that, but we also have no major new titles releasing during the quarter. So a lot of the revenue was from our catalog, which has lower margins. And we also have some significant marketing costs for some future releases, as well as for some already released titles in the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I believe you said 65% of revenues in fiscal '14 from Rockstar, which equates to somewhere around $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion. Can you -- $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion -- Can you tell us what else besides GTA will be supporting that number? Do you expect a lot of catalog for Rockstar? And then maybe, Strauss, could you tell us just kind of what kind of presence you might have at E3, if any?", "Lainie Goldstein", "On the 65% from Rockstar, it would be for the GTA release, as well as our strong catalog. And then for E3, he asked...", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "I'm sorry, I missed that question. Justin, could you repeat that question regarding E3?", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sure. Just kind of what kind of presence you expect to have this year and what's kind of your just overall philosophy towards that show of having a big presence?", "Karl Slatoff", "Justin, it's Karl. We do -- as I said in my remarks, we don't plan to have a booth on this floor this year, but we will be there. 2K and Rockstar have other events, marketing and PR events planned over the summer. So our philosophy on the show is that we like the show, we participate in a meaningful way in the show. It's a great place for the industry to get together, and we're highly supportive of it. This year it just didn't make sense for us in the same -- at the same level.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Mike Olson Junior with Piper Jaffray.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "One of the assumptions that many people make about transitioning to new console platforms is there'll be related uptick in development expense. But we haven't necessarily heard that from others in this space. Could you just share your thoughts on what you expect for any impact on development expense for next-gen consoles? And then another one related to marketing around GTA V. Just any thoughts around kind of how you're going to be marketing it and then maybe talking high-level about the role that you think marketing plays in the industry today given the sort of concentration of big-budget titles that we're going to see arriving this fall and holiday?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks. We haven't talked specifically about development expense. You're right that, historically, as new platforms enable new work are launched, development expenses have indeed gone up. We're fortunate that we were also able to take our top-quality titles and deliver strong revenues from those titles and, therefore, deliver profitability. So one of our -- 1 of the 3 tenets of our strategic approach here is efficiency, and we aim to be the most efficient company in the business. And that includes development spending. So it's a major area of focus for us. Our goal is to deliver the highest quality titles and sort of market them as effectively, if not more effectively, than anyone else. Which leads me to answer your question on marketing Grand Theft Auto and other titles. And look, I'm really proud of our worldwide marketing and sales operation. I think over and over again, we've proven that, that's a major strategic asset. There are only fewer than a handful of companies that are in the industry who have it. Every time we release a major title, we have to innovate because, basically, when we market something in an innovative way, the industry takes notice. And frankly, when our competitors do, we take notice. So we have some tricks up our sleeve going forward. I'm not going to discuss them today. You'll see them as they unfold. But marketing is obviously a crucial part of what makes us as successful as we have been and intend to continue to be.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.", "Two questions, if I might. First, an observation. In your press release, you noted that Grand Theft Auto IV continues to be a primary driver of catalog sales, which suggests to me that the title of the franchise has a lot longer legs than maybe one might expect. So my question on Grand Theft Auto is if you look at the slate of title coming out after GTA, what is your -- can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about DLC or add-on content? I mean, obviously, you're not going to give us a specific plan here, but sort of how you're thinking about keeping the business relationship with the customers that love your game after the core game is launched? And then second question on development expense, also. If we look back 6 years ago at this time, we didn't have an opportunity to put on titles like you guys produced on a flip phone. And today, there's a lot of platforms that may be addressed what you do. What is the distribution of your R&D spend look like for next-gen consoles versus supporting old-gen consoles and versus mobile? How that kind of development budget, if you have a little  [ph]  dollar, where does it go? Does it go to mobile? Does it go to supporting kind of the core business?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, I think, Daniel. For our AAA releases of late, we've offered downloadable content for all of those releases. So clearly, trying to keep customers engaged, trying to keep the games in their hands and most, importantly, trying to delight our customers remains our primary focus. And the reason we've done, as well as we have is that despite the ups and downs in the marketplace, our scores remain high, and we keep giving customers what they want. So whether that means downloadable content, whether that means companion apps on other devices, whether that means in-game goods, whether that means free-to-play opportunities, we're ecumenical. We want to be where the customer is and on whatever device he or she uses, wherever he or she is all over the world. That's our stated strategy, and we intend to keep on doing it. So we haven't made any specific announcements with regard to downloadable content for future releases. But historically, we have been there. In terms of development expense, we do not break it out among platforms. As you would imagine, our big console tentpole releases are very costly compared to some of our other releases, but we have not broken out those line items.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company.", "Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just wonder if you could verify that the guidance you've given for fiscal '14 is just predicated on the titles that you announced to date for fiscal '14, that there's not anything that's critical to that guidance that you haven't announced yet?", "Lainie Goldstein", "There are some unannounced titles in fiscal '14's guidance. However, they are not very material to the overall outlook for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with national alliance securities.", "Michael Hickey - National Alliance Capital Markets, Research Division", "Just curious on Rockstar, they've been pacing about 1 big game per year, should we continue to think that's how they're going to perform here at fiscal '15 and beyond?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We haven't talked about how they're going to perform going forward. But putting out one massive tentpole title a year takes an enormous amount of effort. And it's worked very well with Rockstar so far.", "Michael Hickey - National Alliance Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And then just curious, Strauss, what you think on next-gen software pricing. I mean, I pre-ordered GTA V today at $60. It's pretty close to next-gen consoles coming out. Do you think you're going to have a premium to where current gen is currently priced? Or how do you think that's going to impact current gen pricing, I guess, is what I'm getting at?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "The government doesn't take kindly to me talking about pricing. So we tend not to talk about our pricing. We do offer premium product.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.", "Yes, you do. Okay. And then last question, just curious, on WWE, obviously, it's always been, from what I can tell, a pretty good game here. And I think the marketing benefits a lot from the WWE. I mean what do you think, strategically, on that? Is there other drivers? Is there ancillary products? Is there something else you can do with it? And I'm curious kind of where the breakeven is on that game?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We're really excited about being in business with WWE. I was just at their Massive event and it was extraordinary. I think there were 90,000 fans in the arena, and it was raining. And it's an amazing franchise that pleases the whole family, and we're delighted to be in business with WWE. We're working as closely as possible with the development team and with the WWE folks in Stamford. And we are -- our aim is to put out an A-plus product and give an A-plus marketing that's utterly consistent with the franchise. We think the demographics are sound and growing, and we couldn't be more thrilled. As far as our financial expectations, I think you know that, generally speaking, we try not to enter into arrangements unless we have a good deal of confidence that they're going to be profitable.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions on mobile platforms. Do you see in every differentiation in terms of trends on Android versus iOS, maybe in emerging markets? And then as you think about marketing around those products and around emerging markets, is there -- can you give us any color on how it differentiates from your marketing programs for console-based games?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, I mean, there are -- market by market, there obviously are trends Android versus iOS.  iOS is a very powerful domestic platform, Android tends to be a more powerful international platform. But again, our strategy is to make our titles available for all of these platforms and to be ecumenical about it. When we don't have to make a bet, we don't want to make a bet. Occasionally, we do, especially with regard to consoles. But with regard to the mobile platforms, we're pretty much able to support everything that's out there. As you can imagine, our marketing expenses have to be tailored to the economic opportunity. The bulk of the economic opportunity that faces our company now is driven by our AAA console titles and the catalog related thereto. So that's where our marketing expenses go. As mobile titles grow in importance, I'm sure we'll be competitive with our marketing spend. But we are not big believers in the if-we-build-it-they-will-come strategy in business. We tend to be a little more grounded than that. And our view is we want to make sure that there is a market. And then we want to satisfy and delight the market. We do not see it as an opportunity for us to go build a market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of the Stephen Ju with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Strauss, as you have mentioned of the upcoming new consoles and your release slate, is there anything you can share in terms of the cost to port a game between platforms, either down port or up port as you might think it's appropriate? And do you think it will be a relatively straightforward process or something more time-consuming based on the feedback from your development teams?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. And look, there's nothing straightforward about making what we hope will be the standard bearers of the industry. And there's no question that developing for what will be next-gen will be complicated and for the type of titles we do, will be costly. That said, we have a very strong balance sheet, and we align our business with our costs. And one of our 3 strategic objectives is to be the most efficient company in the business. We haven't talked specifically about the cost profile of next-gen releases, and we don't aim to do that now. But we are exceedingly mindful of costs, and we are hopeful that over time, there will be some efficiencies as we support every platform that's out there. But it's too early to say that, that will be the case.", "Operator", "Mr. Zelnick, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for additional or closing comments.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're thrilled to be able to deliver such good news across the board, whether it's our last year -- last quarter's results, last year's results, our guidance for this year or our outlook for the future. We're also pleased that our strategic initiatives are coming along so effectively. We're grateful to our shareholders for their support and first and foremost, to our creative teams, our marketing teams, our distribution teams and the business teams that make it all happen.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Hank Diamond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Take-Two Interactive. Thank you, Mr. Diamond, you may now begin.", "Henry Diamond", "Good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 ended June 30, 2013. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We have no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors.

These documents may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.I'd also like to note that unless otherwise stated, all numbers we will be discussing today are non-GAAP. Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted at www.take2games.com for a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation. And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. During our fiscal first quarter, we continued to benefit from robust demand for our recent releases, Evergreen catalog titles and expanding portfolio of unique digitally delivered offerings. This enabled our company to deliver results that exceeded our outlook, marking the fourth consecutive quarter in which we've outperformed expectations. These results confirm that the market for the highest-quality current generation titles remain strong even as anticipation builds for upcoming launches of next-generation consoles later this year.", "Accordingly, we've increased our revenue and earnings outlook for fiscal year 2014.Turning to the key drivers of our first quarter results, the enduring popularity of Borderlands 2 has enabled the title to sell in nearly 7 million units and remains on track to become the highest selling release in the history of 2K. During the first quarter, we launched 3 critically acclaimed and highly successful downloadable add-on packs for the title, including the Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack, Psycho Pack and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep. Add-on content for Borderlands 2, including its season pass, was the single-largest contributor to our first quarter results. Our add-on content provides incremental revenue and profits, while also helping to deepen the engagement of existing fans and attract new ones.", "", "NBA 2K13 continues to grow its audience around the world and contribute significantly to our results. The title is now both the highest-selling and most-profitable sports release in the history of 2K, with more than 6 million units sold in worldwide. In addition to being the industry standard bearer, the success of NBA 2K13 has been enhanced by record digital sales for the franchise, including virtual goods, while our NBA 2K Everywhere offerings bring the brand to every screen where consumers want to experience the very best in basketball. BioShock Infinite is North America's best-selling multiplatform release so far this year, according to NPD. The title has crossed the 4 million unit selling mark, and we expect it to become the top-selling release in the BioShock franchise. It's being supported with downloadable add-on content, which Karl will discuss shortly.", "", "We had no tentpole releases during the first quarter, and therefore our industry-leading catalog was particularly integral to our results. In addition to Borderlands, catalog sales were led by Rockstar Games' iconic Grand Theft Auto franchise and Red Dead Redemption, which continue to attract new fans years after launch. Our strong catalog remains an important competitive advantage and provides a relatively stable and predictable profit stream to complement our new release schedule.", "Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 128% in the first quarter and accounted for a record 52% of our total non-GAAP net revenue. The primary drivers were add-on content and full-game downloads of new and existing catalog titles. We also benefited from in-game purchases of virtual goods and our growing portfolio of mobile offerings. On June 20, we released XCOM: Enemy Unknown for iOS, which is our first mobile version of a current-generation nonsports AAA title and also our first mobile offering to carry a $20 price point. The game received an outstanding 92 average score on Metacritic, and it was among the top 10 grossing apps on iPad within the first week of its release. The success of XCOM: Enemy Unknown for iOS illustrates that consumers are willing to pay a premium price for premium entertainment experience on any platform. This bodes well for the opportunity to deliver profitably our most immersive new AAA titles to mobile platforms as they evolve.", "", "Recently, we further strengthened our already solid balance sheet through the completion of a $287.5 million offering of 1% convertible senior notes due 2018. This enabled our company to refinance its 4.357% -- 4.375% convertible senior notes due 2014 on substantially improved terms while also increasing our cash. We're highly optimistic about our potential for growth over the long term. This additional capital gives us even greater flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that we may see in the marketplace for studio or intellectual property acquisitions, strategic investments, share repurchases and other initiatives to expand our business and create shareholder value. We're pleased with our start to the fiscal year, which promises to be one of Take-Two's best ever, led by the eagerly anticipated launch of Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V on September 17 and the fall releases of NBA 2K14 and WWE 2K14. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the upcoming launches of next-generation consoles. We have an extensive development pipeline, highlighted by proven franchises in groundbreaking new intellectual property. As a result, we expect to deliver non-GAAP profits this year and fiscal 2015 and for the foreseeable future. I will now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Strauss. Today I'll give an update on the recent releases and development pipeline. Earlier this month, 2K successfully launched Sid Meier's Civilization V: Brave New World, a massive expansion pack for Firaxis Games' award-winning strategy title, providing new depth and replayability through the introduction of international trade and a focus on culture and diplomacy.

Thanks, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review our results for the fiscal first quarter and then discuss our updated outlook for fiscal year 2014 and our initial outlook for this fiscal second quarter. All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP results from continuing operations and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our results for the fiscal first quarter, net revenue decreased 36% to $144.3 million, as last year's first quarter benefited from the releases of Max Payne 3 and Spec Ops: The Line, and we had no significant releases during this year's first quarter. This exceeded our outlook range of $100 million to $125 million due to strong sales of digitally delivered offerings, particularly add-on content for Borderlands 2. Catalog sales accounted for 60% of net revenue, led by the Borderlands franchise, the Grand Theft Auto franchise and Red Dead Redemption. Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 128% year-over-year and accounted for a record 52% of net revenue.", "The largest contributor to offerings are Borderlands 2, the Grand Theft Auto franchise, NBA 2K13 and BioShock Infinite. Gross margin increased 15.8 percentage points to 35.4% due primarily to lower development royalties and a higher mix of digital revenue during the quarter. Gross margin was lower than expected, as we recognized the $29 million impairment of capitalized software development cost during the quarter related to a 2K title in development.", "Operating expenses were approximately $94 million, down by about $45 million due primarily to lower marketing expenses, as we had no new major releases during the quarter. In addition, G&A was lower due to the absence of the $15 million onetime contractual obligation that was recorded in the first quarter last year.", "", "Interest and other expense was $4 million, and non-GAAP net loss was $47.1 million or $0.54 per share as compared to a net loss of $98.8 million or $1.16 per share in fiscal first quarter 2013. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $61.9 million or $0.71 per share. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net loss include the impairment of capitalized software development cost of $29.6 million or $0.34 per share for GAAP, and $29 million or $0.33 per share for non-GAAP. Our non-GAAP net loss of $0.54 per share exceeded our outlook range of a loss of $0.55 to $0.70 per share, primarily due to a stronger-than-expected digital sales, partially offset by the impairment of capitalized software development cost.", "", "Turning to some key items from our balance sheet of June 30, 2013 as compared to March 31, 2013, our cash balance increased to $646.3 million. Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $35.2 million, primarily reflecting collections on receivables associated with the release of BioShock Infinite near the end of the fourth quarter. Inventory decreased to $27.9 million, and software development cost and licenses remained relatively flat at $293.6 million, reflecting the development efforts around our pipeline of upcoming releases, offset by the impairment of capitalized software recorded during the quarter.", "", "As mentioned by Strauss, we recently completed an offering of $287.5 million of 1% convertible notes due 2018. At the same time, we issued a notice calling all of our outstanding 4.375% convertible notes due 2014 for redemption on August 29, 2013. It's important to raise money when market conditions are receptive, and this is a very rare and possibly short-lived window of opportunity to take advantage of very attractive terms. Essentially, we are refinancing the old converts, which has a coupon of 4.375% and effective strike price of $14.95 of maturity for the new convert, with a much lower coupon of 1% and a much higher strike price of $21.52. At the same time, we've added additional cash to support our long-term growth initiatives, refinance other indebtedness and/or execute on our share repurchase authorization. From an income statement perspective, we expect to reduce our annual non-GAAP interest expense by approximately $3.5 million and modestly increase our fully diluted share count once the redemption is completed in August.", "Now I will review our financial outlook for the full year and second quarter fiscal 2014, which is all provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are revising our financial outlook for fiscal 2014 to reflect a strong first quarter result and outlook for the remainder of the year. We now expect non-GAAP net revenue to range from $1.775 billion to $1.875 billion, and non-GAAP net income to range from $2.25 per share to $2.50 per share.", "", "Turning to the details of our full year outlook, our expected revenue range is since the on-time release of the titles we have planned for launch during fiscal 2014. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 65% from Rockstar and 35% from 2K. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 50% United States and 50% international. We expect gross margins in the low 40s. Total operating expenses are expected to decrease by approximately 4%, primarily due to lower sales and marketing expense. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 13% of net revenue based on the mid-point of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $12 million, tax expense of about $9 million and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately $127 million.", "", "This reflects weighted average basic share of approximately 90 million, which includes an estimated 1.5 million shares to be issued to settle our 4.375% convertible notes, 10.5 million participating shares for our unvested stock-based compensation awards, and 26.5 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the \"if-converted\" method of accounting.", "", "Turning to the outlook for the second quarter fiscal 2014, we expect non-GAAP net revenue to range from $750 million to $800 million and non-GAAP net income to range from $1.20 to $1.35 per share. The majority of our revenue in the second quarter is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto V. We expect second quarter gross margins in the low 40. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 44% from the prior year second quarter, driven primarily by higher sales and marketing expenses.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 14% of net revenue based on the mid-point of our outlook range. Our second quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $3.5 million, tax expense of about $4 million and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 124 million. This reflects weighted average basic shares of approximately 87.5 million, which includes an estimated 1 million shares issued to settle our 4.375% convertible note, 10 million participating shares for our unvested stock-based compensation awards, and 26.5 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the \"if-converted\" method of accounting.", "In closing, our better-than-expected start to fiscal 2014 continues the positive momentum of our business and ushers in what we believe will be a terrific year for Take-Two. With numerous opportunities for growth and further diversification on the horizon, our organization has an incredibly strong balance sheet and the fiscal discipline to efficiently drive long-term shareholder value. I'd also like to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication in helping Take-Two achieve its goals today, and building an even stronger company for tomorrow. Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their effort in delivering a solid start to what we believe will be a fantastic year for the company. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued interest and support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess just 2 questions. You're raising revenues, it's still very early in the year, just what gives you most confidence that you can achieve the higher revenue forecast for the year? What's kind of going right, right now? And then secondly, any thoughts on potentially keeping the share count in check now that you've kind of done all the convertible activity? And are there ways the company can actually start thinking about reducing the share count?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Justin. We're increasing the financial outlook based on our better-than-expected results for the first quarter and our strong release schedule for the remainder of the year, including obviously Grand Theft Auto V, our NBA title, our WWE title and our catalog titles and the rest of our release schedule, so it's looking very sound. In terms of our share count, remember our share count is driven by cap accounting, that means we have to include things like unvested options. It also varies depending on whether we're in a profit or a loss quarter. It also varies with regard to the accounting for our converts. And the answer is based on this most recent financing, our share count really hasn't changed very much at all, and we feel the small change is actually swamped by the reduction in the interest cost and the benefit of the incremental capital in our balance sheet. In terms of other steps to reduce the share count, I think the real question is, what steps are we taking to increase value per share and the value of the company overall? And those steps, we outlined them some years ago and we've been trying to execute against. Primarily, what we've tried to do is diversify the product offerings of the company, be a market leader in terms of the quality of our intellectual property and the quality of our individual leases for those franchises. Every year since 2007, we've released a multimillion unit, new intellectual property, we'd like to keep doing that. We've expanded our offerings around the world. We've gotten into mobile business and other businesses, including the MMO business in Asia. And we've really been a leader in innovating for product offerings, whether that's in-game payments or free-to-play games in Asia with partners. We need to keep doing more of that. The fact is, today, we reported over $600 million of cash on our balance sheet and an outlook of -- for making $2.25 to $2.50 a share in non-GAAP earnings. And we've also said, importantly, that we expect the following fiscal year to be profitable and to be profitable for the foreseeable future. If we're able to achieve that and we have a good deal of confidence that we can, then the value of the company and of all those shares will -- should increase. And that's certainly our hope and expectations.", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. Maybe a follow-up on the first point. Are you seeing a little bit better preorder activity than you saw maybe a couple of months ago? Or are you seeing just more demand from retailers for some of your big releases? Any update on how you're looking at the slate right now?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We don't talk about specific preorders, but I will tell you that the outlook is great and the feedback directly from retail is terrific. And obviously, the release that this whole company is focused on worldwide is Grand Theft Auto V. And we're very proud of the fact that we are one company, even though we have a relatively far-flung group of employees in multiple locations all over the world. We all pull together to get behind all of our tentpole releases. And retail's our most important partner, it still represents the bulk of our revenues. Feedback, including the feedback driven by preorders, has been nothing short of extraordinary. However, we don't discuss the specific numbers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I know you don't want to get into any kind of numbers on GTA V, but I thought maybe we could talk about GTA IV and if you could just remind us what that title in its first year and life to date, as you continue to see success of that product. And then also in terms of the digital strategy for GTA V, obviously huge opportunity there. You're doing some of that right at the start. It will be helpful to maybe understand how frequently you'll be introducing additional digital content.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. We've -- for Grand Theft Auto IV, we've sold in about 25 million units inception to date. I don't have the first-year numbers at the tip of my tongue. Although, I guess, the answer is that -- Hank does. So we sold through about 8.5 million units the first month, that's about 11 million units within the first month of launch in 2008, just putting in context. But the more important point is that we've sold in 25 million units of GTA IV inception to date and still selling now, this many years later, and the entire franchise has sold in about 125 million units, over 125 million units. So -- and it's also worth noting that the install base today of the platforms for which we're releasing is roughly triple it was when we launched GTA IV. That isn't to say that we'll see a straight line to results, but this massive install base at the time when we think consumers are hungry for Grand Theft Auto V is very good news indeed. In terms of digital content, we're going to let Rockstar Games talk about digital plans for the title. That's the appropriate place for us to talk about to what we're doing for the product and what we're doing for marketing. But suffice it to say that we've been a leader in digital add-on content in the quarter that we just released. Our biggest contributor revenue was downloadable add-on content for Borderlands 2, and we think we really do have a point of view about how best to delight consumers not just at the time of the initial release, but also on an ongoing basis. And what we've learned is that downloadable content does not work for every title in the market, it doesn't even work for all of our titles. It works when we put out something really great and then we put out more stuff that people really, really like. And once again, it comes back to delighting consumers. That is Rockstar Games' specialty. That is what Grand Theft Auto V is all about, a delightful consumer experience that we think is going to amaze everyone who plays it. And you'll stay tuned, but we feel really good about it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "You mentioned just now a BBB install base today versus when GTA IV shipped, and is there anything you can say about kind of what your expectations are for GTA V attach rates in the current environment and with the much larger addressable market? And maybe if not specifics on attach rate, just kind of maybe how you're thinking about why attach rates could be different from -- when GTA IV shipped?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Well, we're at a different point in the console cycle, Mike, and there's no doubt that attach rates are lower at the tail end of the console cycle, in general. Because if they weren't, then I'd be telling you that we're going to -- I mean, I guess, I'd extrapolate and so that we expect we'd sell 75 million units of GTA V, which will be lovely, but we're not saying that today and are -- obviously, our financial outlook does not reflect that number. Why do attach rates decline? Because this is a sine-curve business. And when people get new hardware, they overconsume as they get used to having a hardware they underconsume. It's always been the nature of the business for nearly 30 years, and I don't really expect it to change. That said, we're putting out an extraordinary experience, and we do think that avid players and even casual players who own these consoles and some who currently who don't own the consoles will own this title, and we'll be there to serve and meet their needs.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "All right. And then can you just talk about the new day and date release features of the next-gen consoles? Is that something that you guys are excited about or more neutral on? And I guess could you share what percent of your front-line titles tend to be downloaded directly today? I'm assuming it's near 0%.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Oh no, it's not near 0. We definitely have full-game digital downloads, and they're meaningful to us. And obviously, we'll let the console companies talk about their own policies. They set them and we adhere to them, because they're our partners and that's the business that they're in. But our own view is that meeting consumers where they are is the best way to run the business. And then you want to make sure that your policies reflect the way people like to consume product. We've always been ecumenical about platforms, channels, geographies and business models. We are not a rule-based company. Our goal is to delight consumers. And the way we do that this by being flexible, bringing them the best products wherever they are on whatever platform they want to consume it. So we are -- we try to be good partners with the console makers, they are our bread and butter. We support them as they do us. We recognize that they set these policies, and we encourage the policies to be as open-minded as possible. But you can rest assure that we will always be, in our view, a leader in being flexible and consumer-friendly within the purview of the policies that the console makers set.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Two digital items for you. One, can you give us a sense of how much of your digital business was mobile? And then secondly, maybe you could give us a sense, for the digital business, how much came from Asia?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We don't really break it out, but we did say that the biggest drivers were full-game downloads and downloadable content. But apart from that, we don't break it out with more specificity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.", "Two questions, if I might. First, on the console cycle. Can you talk about what your expectations are for the size of the install base cycle-on-cycle and what your expectations are for the initial sell in? I think there's some expectations that the console makers will not repeat past mistakes. And how supply -- if you have any view on that within the industry and whether the early part of the console cycle could be bigger than the early part of the last one, and whether this new console cycle could be as large or be smaller than the last one? And then on digital, your commentary around the relative success that you had with a $20 tablet game. I wonder if you could opine to the future, Strauss, as to when we think we could have a tablet game that is as immersive as a console game, and what that point you'd be able to support console-type prices? Can you get the $60 game when you deliver a game that's as immersive on a tablet as it is on a console or PC?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. I mean, the second question first. The console -- the tablets still aren't powerful enough to run our console titles in their full experiences and the way they want. But that we think that's just a moment in time. We think that if you believe in Moore's Law, and we do, it's a matter of just a couple of years before tablet will be a terrific entertainment platform. It already is a great entertainment platform for watching a TV show or watching a movie. We do need an outboard controller that becomes sort of an industry standard that works for consumers. But I have every reason to believe that a tablet will be a great game platform, and we'll be right there. I do think we're a couple of years away. To your point about pricing, we don't tend to spend a lot of time talking about pricing. The truth is that consumers pay for what's of value to them. And obviously, we create a product that's very expensive to make in market, and its price point reflects the intersection of those 2 things. If -- there really is no reason why if you deliver great experience on tablet, we should be price limited. But if we were, we'd have to figure out a different business model, and we're pretty flexible people and we -- I'm sure we'd be able to do that. So we'll listen to consumers and we'll give them what they want. And obviously, the experience that we currently deliver to consoles has a certain price, and it also has a certain cost. And if consumers push back on the individual bite size of a price because it's on a tablet, that wouldn't make very much sense. But if that happened, we could work within those parameters as well by altering and tailoring our product offering. In terms of the console cycle, we're quite optimistic. We don't share our projections or expectations, and we've only announced one title so far, which is the NBA title for next-gen. So we really haven't talked a whole lot about it but, yes, we are pretty optimistic and we're going to leave projections to the analysts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie.", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "A couple of questions on GTA and then one for Lainie. Strauss, can you talk about the marketing plan, how it's going to differ versus what was for GTA IV? Any changes notably between international and domestic? And then also, I know you can't talk about the digital content plans, you'll have Rockstar do that, but can you just talk about from a pure financial point of view, what does the ARPU look like? Or what is the lifetime value of a GTA V consumer look like versus a GTA IV consumer? And then Lainie, could you just let us know what you think the net cash will be by the end of the fiscal year?", "Karl Slatoff", "Ben, it's Karl. In terms of GTA marketing, again, this is really something that Rockstar is better first to talk about than we are. But look, we have a lot more of arcane tools at our at disposal than we did back when GTA IV launched. I mean, online is a much bigger component of most marketing budgets, not just ours, but across the industry. There's also other outlets there's -- that we use. I mean, we're very heavy in retail, preorders are a big part of our marketing strategy. So there are some differences. But rest assured, the Rockstar folks have put together an incredibly comprehensive marketing program that ties in all of our marketing partners, including third-party media sources and retail as well. In terms of the digital content plays, that is something that we're just -- we're ultimately impressing [ph] lifetime value of consumers, et cetera, that's something that we just don't discuss.", "Lainie Goldstein", "And for the cash at the end of the year, we don't provide cash flow projections, but we are going to be cash flow positive for the remainder of this fiscal year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company.", "Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "It looks like you beat your OpEx guidance in the quarter by about $10 million. You lowered your full year OpEx guidance by about $30 million, and I was wondering if you could kind of talk about what's going on there? And then separately, the game that you took the write-down on, is that a game that was canceled or one that remains in development?", "Lainie Goldstein", "So for the OpEx, specifically to this quarter, the beat over last quarter was due to the onetime write-off that we -- or the onetime contractual obligation that we had last year. And then for the full year, it's just an overall mix of where we're seeing the business, in bottoms up, we forecasting for the remainder of the year.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. And in terms of the write-down for software cost, capitalized software cost, we're not providing more clarity on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Edward Williams from BMO Capital Markets.", "San Phan", "This is San Phan for Edward Williams. Just 2 questions. One, can you tell us a bit more about what your plans for the growing cash balance is, particularly after 2K is released? And then 2, if you can share any thoughts on how you're allocating development dollars across legacy consoles or current chain consoles versus next-gen?", "Lainie Goldstein", "I'll take the first part of the question on the cash balance. We did mention that we don't provide cash flow projections, but we plan to be cash flow positive for the remainder of the year.", "Karl Slatoff", "In terms of allocating dev across current-gen, next-gen, we're obviously not going to tell you that specifically. But we can tell you that we're supporting both next-gen and current-gen consoles significantly.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company.", "Mike Hickey", "Just curious, Strauss, on kind of your philosophy if some of your bigger games over next-gen platforms, if you expect any sort of change into how you kind of pace the orations [ph]. I know, historically, you've always kind of left it up to your developers, but with new tech and maybe some more new synergy in terms of less difficulty in terms of competing platforms, you can keep it up at air, at least differently?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Look, it's possible that we are going to find that developing for this next-gen will be more efficient. It's possible to find that it's easier to develop for multiple platforms simultaneously, it remains to be seen. The bulk of our timing of releases though has been driven by making sure that we put out really great titles and making sure that we don't overwhelm audiences and burn out our franchises. Our goal is to try to create permanent franchises, that's the unique goal in the industry. Our competitors do not see it that way. Our competitors' view is that our franchise will have a certain life, and at the end of that life, you move onto the next thing, so you better make hay while the sun shines. Our view is to the contrary. The best franchises are permanent franchises. Outside of our business you can look at James Bond, for example. And it's been our goal not just to preserve and grow the Grand Theft Auto franchise, but also to build other franchises that we think can be permanent, whether that's the Red Dead franchise or the Borderlands franchise or the BioShock franchise or others, Civilization, for example. So I don't -- I think in certain instances, we'd like to see releases paced a little more closely together. I don't really think next-gen is going to change the production approach sufficiently that, that will be the difference that makes the difference.", "Mike Hickey", "And I was just curious on your kind of view on your competitive profile. Obviously, at E3 this year, there seems to be a lot more representation within the open-world experiences. And of course, we're on the front end here of an emerging console cycle where there can be a big share shift. So just curious how you see the competition.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We have a healthy respect for our competition. We don't take anything for granted. We're fond of saying that we think arrogance is the enemy of continued success. We're always looking over our shoulders and not because we are worried about someone eating our lunch, but because we're worried about making sure that we always provide the best experience to consumers, that we're always known as the standard bearer for what is the very best in interactive entertainment. And to do that, we have to be mindful of what our competitors are doing and what our consumers want, and always give them what they want and then some and to do so at a fair price. So we have the highest weighted average Metacritic ratings in the business, and yet we know we can always do more. Our basketball title, for example, is the highest-rated sports title in the business. It has been for 12 years the #1 basketball title, and yet we still want to do more. We're very self-critical, we're always trying to push the envelope. So are we worried about our competition? Yes. But what are we focused on? We focus on our own knitting, making sure that we do is the very best.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Catalog was a key driver for the quarter at 60% of the net rev, and digital is also growing nicely up 130%-ish. How much of the digital is catalog? Have you broken by that, or how do you think about that? Or is it more shift around based on the release lineup? And then maybe one follow-on after that.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Brian, we don't break it out specifically, but we did say that Borderlands 2 downloadable add-on packs was a big driver in the quarter. So it isn't all just catalog. It's good that our catalog is doing so well, it's also good that digital is doing well. It's a mixture of both. You had another question?", "Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes, another quick one. So free-to-play, how do you think free-to-play is driving digital also? Are the conversions trending better or how do you think about that in terms of driving your digital side?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We don't -- our free-to-play business is largely limited to Asia, and that business is developing nicely, as Karl mentioned. We expect it to be a meaningful contributor going forward, but it's already turning into a profit contributor, which is also nice. That business has really unfolded exactly as expected. We mitigated our risk and the risk didn't materialize, and we're being unique to see the reward. But outside of Asia, we basically have business for which people pay for, and that's through pretty much across the board for us. We're open-minded about business models. Free-to-play is a business model, in the states, has been pretty checkered. If you take a look at how some of our competitors have done that have tried to play in that space, there was a brief moment in the sun and that moment has clearly passed. We were highly skeptical that, that business, had been said so publicly. And in any case, it was not an area which we had great expertise. So we continue to play in the mobile space, the bulk of those games are sold. And we continue to be open-minded about business models as they develop.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-ups, I think. On NBA 2K14, wondering if there will be any shipments included in the September quarter? And related to that, can you talk about your expectations for that franchise or that title relative to last year's version? And then secondly, does the pending investment in Activision from Tencent have any impact in your relationship there?", "Karl Slatoff", "I'll take the Activision piece first. I think there's been any affect at all in our relationship with Tencent based on their investment in Activision. So that's a pretty easy one. In terms of NBA 2K14, can you repeat that question again? I think I missed it.", "Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Sure. Will there be any shipments of that title included in the September quarter? And then also, your expectations for the game relative to last year's version?", "Karl Slatoff", "Okay. In terms of September quarter, there wouldn't be, because the game isn't released in September. And in terms of our expectations versus the last one, obviously, we're very excited about -- the great thing about 2K is that the NBA, that VC team of it, every single release, they're pushing themselves. Strauss talked about competition and always looking over our shoulder just to see who's behind us. And in fact, the team in Visual Concepts has always been doing competition against themselves. And every iteration they try to take the game to the next level. And this NBA 2K14 is no exception. So obviously, we're very excited about the release. We've got a great marketing plan around it. We've got a great deal with LeBron, so we think we're going to generate product consumer buzz, and we have very high expectations for the title. In terms of specifics, can't give you those.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just clarification question, guys. The full year guidance, does that include the impairment charge or does not?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes, it does include the impairment charge, Arvind.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments you may have.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Just we'd like to thank our shareholders and everyone else for attending the call today. We appreciate the support. We feel like we're off to a good start. We have a lot of wood to chop for the remainder of the year, but things are looking very positive and promising. So thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you, all, for your participation.

Thank you, sir, you may begin.", "Henry Diamond", "Good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 ended September 30, 2013.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Take-Two delivered record non-GAAP revenue and earnings during the fiscal second quarter, driven by the unprecedented worldwide success of Grand Theft Auto V. Consumers and critics alike responded passionately to the title, enabling it to become the fastest-selling entertainment release in history, with retail sell-through of more than $800 million in its first day and over $1 billion in only 3 days.", "Held by the New York Times as \"the most immersive spectacle in interactive entertainment,\" Grand Theft Auto V received extraordinary reviews, including over 160 perfect scores. The title has already sold-in nearly 29 million units worldwide, exceeding the lifetime sell-in of Grand Theft Auto IV on console in less than 6 weeks after launch. And demands remain strong, as consumers immerse themselves into the vast world of Grand Theft Auto Online.", "We are immensely proud of and grateful to the team at Rockstar Games, who consistently redefine what can be achieved in interactive entertainment. I'd like to congratulate them all on delivering an unparalleled experience and superbly marketing Grand Theft Auto V in a way befitting a cultural phenomenon. I'd also like to thank our sales team for their critical role in making this launch one for the record books.", "In addition to Grand Theft Auto V, our second quarter results benefited from robust demand for our digitally-delivered offerings and renowned catalog titles. Revenue from digitally-delivered content grew 85% year-over-year, driven primarily by full game downloads and add-on content, along with smaller contributions from virtual goods and mobile offerings.", "During the second quarter, 2K released Firaxis Games' massive PC expansion pack, Sid Meier's Civilization V: Brave New World, as well as the first add-on content for Irrational Games' BioShock Infinite, and additional add-on content for Borderlands 2.", "It bears noting that the phenomenal success of Grand Theft Auto V, along with the strong performance of our other recent AAA releases, continues to demonstrate consumers' enduring appetite for ground-breaking interactive entertainment. During a challenging period for many in our industry, our past foremost significant current generation releases, Borderlands 2, NBA 2K13, BioShock Infinite, and Grand Theft Auto V each sold-in more units than any prior title from their respective franchises within the same period after release. We believe it's our unwavering commitment to quality, one of Take-Two's core philosophies, that has been, and will continue to be, our distinguishing pathway for success.", "As a result of our significantly better-than-expected second quarter results and our positive business outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our financial outlook. Fiscal 2014 is poised to be a record year for our company, with projected non-GAAP net revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, and non-GAAP net income of $3.50 per share to $3.75 per share.", "Looking ahead, we're highly enthusiastic about the opportunities presented by next-generation consoles, which are launching in November. We have a robust development pipeline of new intellectual properties and offerings from our proven franchises, including multiple unannounced titles planned for release during fiscal 2015. In addition, we'll continue to invest to enhance our profitability with innovative digitally-delivered offerings for both traditional and emerging platforms.", "Our company has all of the assets necessary for ongoing success, including world-class creative teams, the strongest portfolio of intellectual property in the business, cutting-edge technology and a sound financial foundation. We're better positioned than ever to deliver returns for our shareholders and expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis in fiscal 2015 and every year for the foreseeable future.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Strauss. Today, I'll give an update on our recent releases and development pipeline. I'd like to begin by joining Strauss in congratulating Rockstar Games on their phenomenal launch of Grand Theft Auto V. Enhancing this incredible experience is Grand Theft Auto Online, which had its initial rollout on October 1. This ambitious undertaking offers a dynamic and persistent online world, and is available free with every copy of Grand Theft Auto V. It currently shares gameplay features, geography and mechanics with Grand Theft Auto V that will continue to expand and evolve over time with new features and functionality, as well as new content created both by Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto community. This is the beginning of something new and exciting, and we're very enthusiastic about the opportunity for Grand Theft Auto Online to enhance consumer engagement with the series over time.", "Featuring NBA MVP LeBron James on the cover, NBA 2K14 launched on October 1 and, according to Metacritic, is currently the highest-rated sports game of 2013 on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. ign.com remarked that, \"NBA 2K14 is simply the best hoop sim ever.\" Incorporating the series' signature realism, intuitive new controls and unique game modes, this year's release cements NBA 2K's legacy as the industry's premier sports simulation experience. The title is being supported by NBA 2K Everywhere, our multiplatform offering that gives fans the opportunity to enjoy NBA 2K via a mobile companion app, as well as a full-featured version of the console simulation game for tablets and smartphones.", "NBA 2K14 will also be our first release for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on November 15 and 22, respectively. Built entirely from the ground up for next-generation platforms, NBA 2K14 features a revolutionary new Eco Motion game engine, and 4 entirely new experiences, including NBA Today, MyCareer, MyGM and MyTeam. ign.com voiced their anticipation, stating, \"NBA 2K14 could end up being the most technically impressive launch game on either next-generation platform.\" With unparalleled true-to-life visuals and a groundbreaking feature set, we believe NBA 2K14 will define the standard for next-generation sports simulations. I'd like to congratulate the teams at 2K and Visual Concepts for delivering 2 uniquely different basketball experiences of the highest quality, built specifically to leverage the strength and features of both the current generation and next-generation consoles.", "On October 8, Borderlands 2 further expanded its audience with the release of the Game of the Year Edition, which offers an outstanding value to consumers, including the full game, all of the Season Pass add-on content, 2 additional character classes and more. Demand for Borderlands 2 and it's add-on content remained strong for more than a year after its initial launch, and we remain committed to supporting the franchise with additional high-quality content.", "On October 22, 2K and Gearbox released the first offering in the new Headhunter series, Headhunter 1: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest. With 2 more add-ons planned for the released during 2013, Borderlands 2 has sold in over 7.5 million units and counting, and is on track to becoming the highest-selling title in 2K's history.", "Today, 2K successfully launched WWE 2K14, the latest offering in the popular WWE video game franchise. The title is being supported with a comprehensive selection of downloadable content, including Rockstar editions, fan-favorite gameplay and customization options, which will be available next month through January. This add-on content, which can be purchased individually or through the game's Season Pass program, provides the ultimate WWE video game experience that is perfectly timed for the holiday season.", "On November 12, Firaxis Games will launch XCOM: Enemy Within, the expansion for our Game of the Year award-winning strategy title XCOM: Enemy Unknown. XCOM: Enemy Within provides players with an array of new narrative situations, abilities, weapons, maps, tactical and strategic gameplay and multiplayer content. The title can be enjoyed with previously purchased copies of XCOM: Enemy Unknown on the PC and Mac, and will also be available as a standalone game for Xbox 360 and PS3 under the title XCOM: Enemy Within Commander Edition. IGN called XCOM: Enemy Within one of their most anticipated games of the year. And forbes.com stated, \"XCOM: Enemy Within is a fantastic expansion to one of 2012's best games.", "Also this year, 2K will continue to release downloadable add-on content to support BioShock Infinite and Sid Meier's Civilization V. These include BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea, a 2-part add-on campaign set in the underwater city of Rapture before its fall; and the Sid Meier's Civilization V Scrambled Nations pack, which will include maps from Canada, Australia, Japan, Scandinavia, Great Britain, France, Turkey, Italy, Russia and China, and features randomized interiors with the start of each new game.", "Looking ahead to fiscal 2015 and beyond, we have a strong development pipeline for both traditional and emerging platforms, including revolutionary new intellectual property and offerings from our existing franchises. For example, last January, we purchased the intellectual property for Evolve from THQ. This next-generation title is currently in development at Turtle Rock Studios, the renowned creators of the innovative, cooperative first-person shooter, Left 4 Dead.", "In addition, 2K recently opened a new Bay Area studio, focused on developing an exciting next-generation title.", "These represent just 2 of the more than 10 unique titles in our pipeline for next-generation consoles, which includes multiple releases planned for fiscal 2015. We understand and appreciate that both our consumers and shareholders are eager to learn more about our release schedule, and we expect to begin unveiling titles during the next several months.", "Throughout the past year, we've demonstrated that success in our industry is achieved by mindfully balancing the passion to take creative risks with prudent business management. The need to deliver the highest-quality entertainment has never been more important, and we believe that consumers will continue to seek the most groundbreaking and immersive experiences as we enter the next generation for our industry. Take-Two is well prepared to continue to raise the bar for creative excellence across all platforms that consumers choose to embrace.", "In closing, I'd like to join Strauss in thanking all of our employees for their dedication and hard work during the quarter. Thanks, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll review our results for the fiscal second quarter and then discuss our updated outlook for fiscal 2014 and our initial outlook for the fiscal third quarter. All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP results from continuing operations, and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Note that our GAAP results exclude net revenue and cost of goods sold related to sell-in of the Grand Theft V game during the second quarter, as Grand Theft Auto Online, a free game available with every copy of Grand Theft Auto V, launched during the fiscal third quarter. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our results for the fiscal second quarter. Net revenue increased 340% to a record $1.27 billion. This exceeded our outlook range of $750 million to $800 million due to the blockbuster worldwide success of Grand Theft Auto V.", "Catalog sales accounted for $118.9 million of net revenue, led by Grand Theft Auto IV and offerings of Borderlands 2 and Civilization V.", "Revenue from digitally-delivered content grew 85% year-over-year and accounted for $105.5 million of net revenue, the largest contributor to the Grand Theft Auto series, particularly digital sales and Grand Theft Auto V and offerings to Borderlands 2, Civilization V and BioShock Infinite.", "Gross margin decreased 4.5 percentage points to 39.2% due primarily to higher software development costs and internal royalties.", "Operating expense were approximately $159 million, up by about $47 million, due primarily to higher marketing expenses to support the launch of Grand Theft Auto V.", "Interest and other expense was $3.8 million. And non-GAAP net income was $325.6 million or $2.49 per share, as compared to $10.2 million or $0.11 per share in fiscal second quarter 2013. This result exceeded our outlook range of $1.20 to $1.35 per share. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $124.1 million or $1.40 per share.", "Turning to some key items from our balance sheet at September 30, 2013 as compared to June 30, 2013. Our cash balance increased to $661.9 million. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $1 billion, primarily reflecting the receivables associated with the release of Grand Theft Auto V near the end of the second quarter. Inventory increased to $84 million, primarily for inventory on hand for replenishment orders of Grand Theft Auto V and the launch of NBA 2K14 in early October. And software development costs and licenses decreased to $233 million, reflecting the amortization of development costs for our second quarter releases.", "In August, we completed the redemption of our 4.375% convertible senior notes due 2014, which we had called for redemption on June 12. The company settled the 4.375% notes, which were surrendered for conversion for approximately $166 million in cash and 3.2 million shares of common stock. In conjunction with the redemption, we unwound the call spread associated with the notes, which resulted in the company receiving approximately $29 million in cash.", "Now I will review our financial outlook for the full year and third quarter fiscal 2014, which is all provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are increasing our financial outlook for fiscal 2014 to reflect our strong second quarter results and positive outlook for the remainder of the year. We now expect non-GAAP net revenue to range from $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, and non-GAAP net income to range from $3.50 per share to $3.75 per share. These would be record results for our company.", "Turning to the details of our full year outlook. Our expected revenue range assumes the on-time release of the titles we have planned for launch during the remainder of fiscal 2014. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 70% from Rockstar, 30% from 2K. We expect our geographic revenue splits to be about 50% United States and 50% international. We expect gross margins in the low 40%. Total operating expenses are expected to remain flat. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 11% of net revenue, based on the mid-point of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $12 million, tax expense of about $16 million, and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 126 million.", "This reflects weighted average basic shares of approximately 91 million, 9 million participating shares for our unvested stock based compensation awards, and 26 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible note under the \"if-converted\" method of accounting.", "Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect non-GAAP net revenue to range from $650 million to $700 million, and non-GAAP net income to range from $1.20 to $1.35 per share. The majority of our revenue in the third quarter is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K14, WWE 2K14 and Borderlands 2. We expect third quarter gross margins in the mid-40%. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 15% from the prior year's third quarter, driven primarily by higher sales and marketing expense. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 10% of net revenue, based on the mid-point of our outlook range.", "Our third quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $2 million, tax expense of about $7 million and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 131 million. This reflects weighted average basic shares of approximately 93 million, 11 million participating shares of our invested stock-based compensation awards, and 27 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the \"if-converted\" method of accounting.", "In closing, the consistent execution of our strategy, along with a disciplined approach to capital investment, has enabled Take-Two to achieve strong results. We are well positioned to capitalize on the next generation of consoles, as well as emerging markets and platforms and, most importantly, to deliver consistent profits and returns to our shareholders over the long term. I would like to thank our employees for their tireless commitment to excellence and working together to bring continued success to our organization.", "Thank you. And now I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their efforts in delivering a history-making quarter for our company. And to our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "You obviously have a huge installed base growing, a record installed base. Can you talk a little bit about the gameplay activity that you're seeing, either online or just in total, relative to other huge hits like Call of Duty and Battlefield? And then how do you think about leveraging that activity into some digital sales next year? And then the second question is, as we enter the next-generation transition, does that create any interruptions or disruptions with Rockstar's game pipeline, or is it still possible to see a consistent, like, 1 release per year?", "Karl Slatoff", "Justin, it's Karl. In terms of the online activity for GTA, obviously, we haven't spoken about the specifics. But needless to say, we've had a very, very positive response. And there are many, many, many players playing at this point and it's going very well. And we've gotten terrific feedback from the community in terms of things that they really love about it. So we're very excited about the opportunity for GTA Online. It's something that we think is very special and unique, and is going to be with us for a very, very long time in the future. In terms of monetization, Rockstar has talked about monetization, and there will be -- there are cash backs available. They're not available right now, but they will be turned on back again at some point in the near future.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "And in terms of -- this is Strauss speaking, your second question. Look, we try not to pat ourselves on the back overly. I do think history says that we managed the console cycle reasonably well in terms of delivering our products at the right time. And I think the release window for GTA V was phenomenal. There was an enormous installed base, massive anticipation and virtually no significant competitive releases. I was questioned an awful lot, you may recall, about the timing of that release. And I think Rockstar made a great decision in putting it out when they did, and really optimized the intersection of what a great game can do and what an audience wanted and when they wanted it. We now come to the end of our current gen releases. It's exactly the right time at this company. And as we said today, we have more than 10 titles in development for next-gen, and we're confident enough about that pipeline that we're calling for profitability on an ongoing basis, something that none of us around here does lightly, and something that all of us around here are really proud about. So Rockstar and 2K, both, are operating with within the reality that we have 2 platforms launching in November, about which we're all really excited. And we have great titles coming up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC", "Help me in whatever way you can, sort of bridge the gap between $1 billion in 3 days and 29 million units sold life-to-date. How much of that 29 million was second quarter versus third quarter? How much was sell-in versus sell-through? Can you give us a sell-through number at this point? Can you help us out with the ASP? And ultimately, I guess one of the things that would be really helpful for us is just figuring out how much inventory is sitting at retail, as we sit here today, of Grand Theft Auto?", "Lainie Goldstein", "James, it's Lainie. We really can't give out additional information than what we've said to date. But I can just point you to the $1 billion is a retail figure. The 29 million units is a sell-in number, and that's what we've done to date, and the $1 billion was in the first 3 days. So there is big differences between those 2 numbers.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC", "Right. I guess that's sort of the point. I guess let me ask you in a different way. Are you sitting on a bunch of inventory as we sit here today, which would assume that the retail number isn't anywhere close to that $29 million number -- or 29 million unit number, I should say? Or I guess, asked a different way, as we think about your second quarter guidance, do you continue to assume that you're going to be shipping copies of GTA in the December quarter?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, it's a fair question. The industry, in general, has been very tight on inventory as they head into the end of the cycle. We don't comment on our own inventory levels around here. And in terms of our expectations going forward, yes, we fully expect to keep selling lots and lots of this game, and I think the fact that we've sold in more than 29 million units to date in 6 weeks is pretty extraordinary. So demand remains very, very strong indeed. I think it's a fair question, because I think some people have asked us to put a finer point than you did on your question. It was just a reflection of all the demand being pulled to current, but there's just no evidence that, that's the case at all. It's not as though consumer say, the next-gen is coming, so I have to buy this title and then I'm never going to buy it again. It's not how they operate. This is a reflection of our finest hopes coming true, which was the intersection of a massive installed base with a massively popular title.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC", "Very helpful. And then, Lainie, maybe you can help us a little bit with just the accounting of how all the development costs associated with GTA are going to work. What portion of those costs -- I know you're not going to give us a number, a total budget, but can you help us with what portion of those costs have already been expensed and how we should think about the rest getting expensed as we move forward? And then as we think about the DLC portion and I guess, more specifically, the online portion, were those development costs capitalized and are they going to be expensed along with the development cost for the individual game? How should we think about all that?", "Lainie Goldstein", "So for the development costs, the way we'll look at it is, on a non-GAAP basis, it will be with the revenue. So we take the revenue for the period and then we'll take what the estimated lifetime revenue is, and the expenses will be spread over that period of time for a non-GAAP basis. The online development costs also have been capitalized alongside with the online game and it, again, will be spread along with the revenue.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC", "So I guess to ask a different way, at what point -- what's sort of your assumption with regards to the \"lifetime of the game\"? Or as we move forward, presumably margins get better, right, as we burn off the majority of those development costs, When does that sort of end? At what point in the future will -- are you projecting to have expensed through all those development costs?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, we actually don't guide that tight. We basically -- what Lainie is saying is on a non-GAAP basis, we aim to match the revenue and the development costs and the initial cycle of releases. And you're absolutely right, when something rolls off into our catalog, we're no longer amortizing development costs, we typically don't in marketing costs, and therefore, the gross margin would indeed be higher. But we're not quoting any specific timing or numbers today.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes. Each quarter we'll update our estimated lifetime for the product, and that can adjust where the cap's off our amortization is. But basically, is over what that lifetime is estimated to be, and that can change over time.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "But ultimately, as it hits your catalog, it hits your catalog. And it ultimately has no cost profile associated with it, apart from the cost of actually shipping the goods on an ongoing basis.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC", "But the profile of sales is based on what we know today as opposed to what you guys were projecting initially for the game?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, we would update our estimates every time. So based on the way the title launched and where -- I'm saying that it performed better than our expectations, yes, the lifetime would probably also be adjusted each quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie.", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "A few questions on digital and then one for Lainie on the cash. On the digital, would you say that this is the biggest-ever full game download digital title? And what was split between PlayStation and Xbox? And then also, how does that -- or what does that mean for the margin of those digital titles? And then just separately, thinking forward about the digital opportunity, I just want to make sure that I understand how to think about it correctly. I think about it in kind of 3 pieces: you have the full game downloads; you have the digital episodic content that potentially could come for GTA V; and then separately, GTA online. Is that the correct way to think about it? And then one follow-up on for Lainie.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Ben, do you mean by biggest download, the biggest-size download? Or the biggest number of downloads?", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "I guess either revenue or number of downloads for a full game?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "I don't think we actually know the answer to the first question. I suspect it probably is the biggest game that was ever downloaded...", "Karl Slatoff", "It was certainly the biggest on the PlayStation Network on the day release. It was the biggest at first-day on platform. But other than that, we know -- we don't have...", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "But in terms of the number of bytes, I suspect, it's also the biggest, but I could be wrong about that. And we've talked about margins before. We've basically said our margins on digital distribution are somewhat higher than on physical distribution, but not meaningfully higher, typically. And in terms of the way you parsed digitally-delivered revenues here, yes, you've got it correctly. And I suppose I'd add to that, ultimately, catalog. But full-game download, DLC and in-game payments, that would all constitute digitally-delivered revenue.", "Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research", "Great. And then Lainie, if I could just follow up on the cash. Based on the guidance you've given, what do you expect the cash balance to be by the end of '14? And if any of you want to update us on your thoughts about potentially returning excess cash to shareholders, that will be great.", "Lainie Goldstein", "For the cash balance, we don't provide cash flow projections. We are going to be cash flow positive for the remainder of the year, from this point forward, as well as the whole year. And you asked a question, what's the use of cash. So as we said before, we've been investing in our business, looking at acquisition opportunities. If we think it makes sense, we have authorized a share repurchase program. So if the opportunity presents itself and it makes sense for us, that could be an option for us as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "A couple of follow-ups to Ben's questions. First of all, what percentage of the 29 million units sold for GTA were full digital downloads? Secondly, when you look at your buyback -- looks like you haven't done any share repurchases yet, but given how strong your earnings were and your confidence in the business, is there a reason why -- I would assume you think your shares are relatively inexpensive, why you're not buying back stock? And then third, with GTA Online, as more people start migrating over time to the next-gen platforms, will next-gen players be able to access GTA Online?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. So we said that in the quarter about 8% of our revenue was from digitally-delivered offerings across the board. We're not talking specifically about GTA V's percent related to digitally-delivered revenue. But I think that gives you a certain amount of guidance, obviously. And in terms of share repurchases, we didn't repurchase any stock in the fiscal quarter. We do have an authorized stock repurchase outstanding. And we do have ample capital to pursue all the opportunities that Lainie outlined. We are a very conservative management team. And as we head into a platform transition, companies with meaningful, strong balance sheets are well positioned, and that's very important to us. So first and foremost, we want to be rock-solid around here. Secondly, we are looking at, and always have looked at, accretive M&A. And let me emphasize accretive. We don't -- accretive is not in the eye of the beholder, it's actually math. And we're interested in accretive M&A that fits with our core business. And third, of course, over time, one must and should look at returning capital to shareholders in an appropriate way, and there are numerous ways that, that can be achieved.", "Karl Slatoff", "And Eric, as of GTA Online for next-generation, I think, was your question. We haven't discussed any plans for GTA, at all, in relating to next-generation. So nothing to say there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.", "Strauss, looking again at the opportunity to monetize the large installed base of GTA V. I recall last time around with GTA IV when you released expansion packs, whether they were digital or offered on disc, like Lost and the Damned, the one issue was that they came out significantly later than when the game did. And I believe you made a comment at that time that, that was kind of one of the lessons learned to get those kind of expansion packs out sooner. And then since that time, a trend has emerged among other large games to sell sort of a Season Pass to a series of announced expansion packs, which many people have the opportunity to buy when they buy the game in the first place. So you have a large installed base, 17, 20 million people who already have the game who didn't get that opportunity. Can you speak to -- I know you want to give the exact roadmap, but what the opportunity to sell add-on content to the single-player campaign as opposed to the micro transactions. Is that still in the cards? Or can you give us a little bit of color on what might we see there?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "So we always prefer that our labels talk about our marketing plans, and we tend not to discuss them on the call. I appreciate the thoughtful question, and we give a lot of thought to just the questions you raise. I think the biggest difference here is -- than the last release is, when Rockstar came out with downloadable content for GTA IV, this was groundbreaking stuff. It had never been done before. And they took a big creative risk and delighted consumers and made money in the process. So it was really a great result. And we, at this company, and our label, specifically, have learned a lot about what consumers want. But what we find is, when you have a hit product, there is an opportunity to continue to delight consumers with ongoing content, and that always remains our focus. Our focus around here did not start with how do we look at our consumers, they showed up in droves and how do we extract more money from their pockets. We genuinely don't. What we think about is, the reason our consumers showed up is because we delighted them in a way they didn't expect. As high as their expectations were, we blew them out of the water and we did that because of the extraordinary creative work done at Rockstar. And then that's the way this company operates. And then having done that, we think, okay, now what is the appropriate way to price this experience so that we can appropriately compensate all of our stakeholders, the people who create the products, the employees who work at this company and of course, our shareholders? And we've always looked at pricing all of our content with an eye towards giving people more than they pay for, trying to overdeliver. So GTA Online is free with the game. And it's the first time we've ever done anything like this. It's incredibly ambitious and taxing and challenging. And consumers love it, and they're showing up in great magnitudes. As Karl said, there is currency in the game and there are plans, at some point, to make that currency available for cash payments in addition to other ways you can earn currency in the game. We'll let Rockstar talk more about that. We don't need to talk more about that today. But for sure, we're commercial folks, and we are in business. But where we start here is with a passion for what we do, then we think about how what we do is going to delight consumers. And then, and only then, do we think about how we're going to monetize it.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research, Inc.", "And a follow-up to that question, perhaps for Lainie. Is the cost of maintaining GTA Online a material part of your OpEx going forward, or is that sitting in COGS? And can you give us just a scale of how big an ongoing cost maintaining the server is, and systems around that platform are?", "Lainie Goldstein", "The costs would be included in our -- what we capitalize and then spread over the revenue stream, included with the overall capitalized software for GTA. But it is a good question in terms of how much that's going to be going forward. There will be some of it, the server cost and things like that in the OpEx, but most of the time and effort by the teams will be included in the cap's software.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "And let me just emphasize, in one of our stated strategies is to be the most efficient company in the business. We did not go out and build a massive infrastructure to support something before we understood where consumers were going to be -- where they were going to be. We are learning every day how to do this in a high-quality way, and there will be some costs associated with it. We have 0 doubt that the revenue will vastly exceed any operating expense.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions had been answered. Just a couple of small ones. One, as you talk about your next-gen and the 10 titles in development I assume you have now a pretty clear picture of what the initial net costs are going to look like in your plans. And directionally, I'd like to just get some comfort level on how these costs are shaping up versus your expectations versus perhaps the lifecycle, et cetera. Any changes to your thinking? And then lastly, just a quick update on Asia and what's going on there and opportunities that you see in the coming quarters and years?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. In terms of dev cost for the more than 10 next-gen titles we have in development, we do spend meaningfully on our games, it's how we have the highest-rated games in the business. We don't, so far, see meaningful differences in what it's going to cost to develop for next-gen versus what it's been costing to develop for current-gen. And in terms of Asia, what we've said is that NBA 2K Online is one of the top 10 played games in Internet caf\u00e9s, according to QQ Games in China. We're very happy with those results and continue to be closely engaged in optimizing and contemplating, expanding that throughout other parts of Asia. We have our baseball game in Korea. That's operating as well. And we continue to develop another game in Korea, Civilization Online, so -- which we've talked about previously. That's still in development. So it remains a very interesting area for us, and it's nice to have 2 games in market.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "But there's talk about consoles in China recently. I wonder if you think that, that is really an opportunity. I know this is just talk right now, but do you really see that as an opportunity for you out in the future?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Well, so far consumers in China really haven't had the opportunity. They play it online and they play very avidly online, but that is typically a free-to-play model where you monetize less than 10% of the audience. It remains to be seen how consoles will do in China. It also remains to be seen what kind of intellectual property protection will be offered in the country. That has been challenging. That doesn't come as a surprise to everyone. We'll be interested in both. If there's an economic opportunity and we can pursue it while keeping our intellectual property secure, we have a presence there, we have a lot of people on the ground, we have multiple offices, we'd be just thrilled. It's a great place to do business. It remains to be seen. Remember, our stated strategy is to be where our consumer is without regard to platform, without regard to type of game, without regard to genre and without regard to business model. We are ecumenical on all of those topics. We're not rule-driven around here. Our goals are simple: be the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient company in the industry.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "I know you're sensitive to this but, obviously, the online piece is pretty important, I would think, to for your fiscal '15 profitability. Can you give us any sense -- and obviously, there's excitement and buzz from it. There's also somewhat a glitch from the beginning which, I think they -- Rockstar did a pretty good job at kind of communicating that it was going to be a work in process. But any sense of just kind of general engagement metrics that we can look at, Strauss, as we try to shape as sort of forward performance opportunity in terms of player conversion, in terms of ARPU, in terms of maybe how you would look at this game, how it performed versus an MMO in China.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Mike, I got, I think, half the question, and I'm going to ask you to repeat the second half. In terms of GTA Online as a financial contributor, this is new and untested so far, and we haven't assumed meaningful revenue. We'd be very grateful if it comes along. What we're focused on is delivering a terrific experience and remains to be seen what kind of contributor is. So our expectations about profitability in 2015 and forward are not at all related to GTA Online, to be specific. And your second question was?", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "I guess just some sort of engagement metrics. I mean, do you plan to provide us, moving forward, with any sort of kind of like payor conversion or ARPU? Are those sort of considerations that are going to help us kind of shape what this thing could generate in terms of performance?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "We try to be as transparent as possible. And if we have meaningful contributors to our revenue and profitability, then we aim to provide transparency. So it remains to be seen. Right now, it's not a topic we need to address.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then just curious on -- just general engagement overall. I mean, initially, people going in to the online experience, are you seeing it kind of drop off? Is this kind of just continual balancing? And are people actively playing it? Is it growing? Any sort of insight there would be helpful.", "Karl Slatoff", "Mike, it's Karl. Like I said before, we're not discussing what the -- specific numbers around engagement at this point. But as I mentioned early in the call, there are many people playing it, the engagement has been very high and the feedback has been extremely positive. And we couldn't be more pleased where we're sitting right now with this exciting opportunity. I just don't have any specifics to share with you right now.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then for fiscal '15, just thinking, obviously, you expect to be profitable here for a period of time. Just thinking about fiscal '15, how much is that catalog performance cost control versus having to get new games to the market and outside of maybe the ones that are pretty easy to model? I mean, we're all trying to get an idea of the key drivers for fiscal '15. I think it's pretty easy to know that NBA and WWE and some of these online experience are going to be contributors, but how much -- how important are the unannounced games in terms of driving performance?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "That's a great question. Our catalog does provide a nice backbone for our business. We have the highest-performing catalog for SKU in the business, and that's driven by our very high Metacritic ratings. Consumers keep buying our titles, and they keep buying the titles even after transitions of platform. So we remain optimistic about our catalog going forward. And digitally-delivered offerings foot with that, because one of the things that digital distribution does is makes your catalog more available. That said, our plans for '15, in fact, reflect a robust release schedule of next-gen titles. We have said that we have more than 10 in development. And generally speaking, in order to be -- to deliver the kind of results we hope to deliver and want to deliver, we do need and expect to have new tent-pole releases.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "A follow-on to that the last question. With your impressive catalog library, are there any unique dynamics you see to catalog sales as you roll through a hardware transition? And then on launches like GTA V, what kind of impact or positive pull-through do you see on a GTA catalog with that type of event?", "Karl Slatoff", "Brian, it's Karl. Your first question was about dynamics on catalog in a console transition?", "Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Karl Slatoff", "Is that correct? Okay.", "Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Karl Slatoff", "We haven't really seen a lot of dynamics that we can specifically relate to a console transition in terms of catalog. What we are seeing is catalog, there's -- the amount of digital activity in our catalog is increasing over time, and we stated that in the past. But to specifically say that this is related to a console transition, we can't really see that at this point. And the second question, I'm sorry, I apologize again, what was it?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Just what does GTA V and catalog have to do with one another? The GTA series continues to sell extraordinarily well years and years after its release. I mean, in this past year, we put out the 10th year anniversary edition for GTA III on tablet, and that did great for us. We've talked about that before. And console transitions don't hurt our catalog particularly. And people keep playing old titles on old consoles that they still have, even when they buy new consoles, if the titles are good enough. There's an element of nostalgia, but only for the best titles. So we have high hopes for our catalog and now digital distribution, obviously, provides another opportunity. And there are other platforms, whether that's Steam or whether that's any number of other opportunities to release our catalog.", "Operator", "Mr. Zelnick, it appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Well, once again, thank you so much for joining us. I just want to take one last moment to express our gratitude to all of our colleagues all over the world for the extraordinary quarter, outlook for the year, and just how well this company is doing. We feel like we're firing on all cylinders, and we're grateful to all of our colleagues for making that happen.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Hank Diamond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Take-Two. Thank you, sir. You may begin.", "Henry Diamond", "Good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 ended December 31, 2013. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer.

Please refer to our earnings release for a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation. Our earnings release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that our business continued to thrive during the fiscal third quarter and we again delivered better than expected results. This was driven by robust holiday demand for Grand Theft Auto V, the record breaking launch of NBA 2K14, the successful release of WWE 2K14, and strong growth in revenues from digitally delivered content. While others in our industry have experienced softness in current gen sales, we continued to benefit from significant demand for our titles reflecting consumers appetite for the highest quality entertainment.", "Grand Theft Auto V continues to expand its audience around the world demonstrating how Rockstar Games have taken their series in our industry to new heights for innovation and excellence. Upon release, the title shattered entertainment records, selling through $800 million in 24 hours and over $1 billion in only three days. And it was the best selling video game of 2013 according to the NPD Group. To date, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 32.5 million units worldwide and demand remains high as millions of consumers enrich their experience through the dynamic and evolving world of Grand Theft Auto online, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.", "The success of Grand Theft Auto V is only part of Rockstar Games unparalleled track record. To date the label has sold in nearly 250 million games worldwide across multiple hit series. 2K builds upon their legacy of delivering the highest graded and top selling basketball video game with their current next-gen releases of NBA 2K14. The title has become the fastest selling release in history of our NBA 2K franchise with sell-in to date of more than 5 million units across console and PC. I would like to congratulate the team of Visual Concepts who simultaneously created two outstanding products for current and next gen platforms.", "Our WWE franchise has quickly proven to be a successful addition to our portfolio. Sales of WWE 2K14 have exceeded our expectations and the title is being supported with add-on content including a Season Pass featuring many of fan-favorite WWE superstars and legends. We believe there is a meaningful opportunity to grow this series by further leveraging 2K's marketing power and development expertise. Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 42% year-over-year to $132.8 million. Nearly half of that revenue was derived from our current consumer spending, virtual currency, add-on content and online gaming. Creating opportunities to drive ongoing engagement with our titles after release is a key strategic focus for our company and is becoming an important driver of additional revenue and profits. It also helps to strengthen our results between frontline releases while providing additional entertainment to consumers.", "Approximately 70% of consumers who have played Grand Theft Auto V while connected to the internet have played Grand Theft Auto online since its launch on October 1. As a result, Grand Theft Auto Online was the single largest contributor to our digitally delivered revenue in the third quarter. While it's still early, we are highly enthusiastic about the future of Grand Theft Auto Online as its global audience continues to grow. Online play contributed to the success of NBA 2K13 and we have seen continued growth with this year's release of NBA 2K14. The majority of NBA 2K14 fans are actively engaged in online connected experiences including multiplayer gaming. In particular, consumers are buying virtual currency to customize their players with clothing and abilities and are also forming teams with friends to play in online competitions.", "Add-on content is also a key component of our current consumer spending. During the third quarter we released successful downloadable content for BioShock Infinite, Borderlands 2, Sid Meier's Civilization V and WWE 2K14. Borderlands 2 is a prime example of how we are able to generate substantial revenue and profits from add-on content over an extended period. In the 16 months following the title launch, we released nine substantial downloadable offerings, dozens of smaller character customizations, and we have plans to release more downloadable content in the coming months. This is an addition of package good, add-on packs, and most recently, a Game of the Year Edition. The popularity of add-on content for Borderlands 2 is an important contributor to the title's becoming the highest selling release in history of 2K with more than 8.5 million units sold-in to date.", "Our online project in Asia, particularly NBA 2K Online in China, are also generating growth and recurrent consumer spending and contributing to our results. We will continue to focus on developing additional offerings to promote engagement with our titles beyond the initial release. This will both deepen our relationships with consumers and boost revenue and profits overtime. In addition to recurrent consumer spending, full game downloads across console, PC and mobile platforms contributed to the growth in our revenue from digitally delivered content.", "During the third quarter Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for a variety of mobile platforms, including iOS and Android. Our ability to bring our popular catalog titles to mobile platforms enable us to grow our audience and generate incremental revenue and profits with modest development cost and virtually no marketing spend. As I have said many times before, being good is simply no longer good enough. To succeed in our industry one must aspire to and deliver greatness. A positive momentum over the past year speaks to our focus on consistently delivering hits. I am particularly proud that Take-Two was the top video game publisher of 2013 according to the NPD Group. This is a tremendous achievement and I would like to congratulate Rockstar Games, 2K and our entire Take-Two team for making this happen.", "Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash of almost $1 billion. We are committed to driving long-term shareholder including returning capital to our investors. To that end, we repurchased $277 million of our stocks during the third quarter. We will continue to explore ways to create value through capital deployment, both by investing to grow our business and potentially returning additional cash to shareholders. As a result of our better than expected third quarter results, we are increasing our full year outlook for fiscal 2014 which is poised to be a record year for our company. We have projected non-GAAP net revenue of nearly $2.4 billion and earnings of more than $4 per share.", "Looking ahead, we have a robust pipeline for both new intellectual properties and offerings from our proven franchises in development including more than ten unique titles for the next generation consoles. We believe that the initial success of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 bodes well for our industry and foreshadows what promises to be a vibrant hardware cycle. In addition to capitalizing on these new consoles, we are continuing to invest prudently in emerging platforms and business models that complement our core focus.", "With a proven strategy, world class creative teams, the strongest portfolio of owned intellectual property in our industry, cutting edge technology and unwavering commitment to quality, and a solid financial foundation, we are positioned to deliver non-GAAP profits in fiscal 2015 and every year for the foreseeable future. We are committed to delivering value for our customers and returns for our shareholders over the long term.", "I will now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Strauss. Today I will provide an update on our development pipeline. In Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar Games has redefined the term blockbuster not just for gaming but also for the entire entertainment industry. And since its launch in October, millions of consumers have engrossed themselves in Grand Theft Auto Online which has quickly become a living, breathing universe that continues to grow. In addition to new game plays and in-game items released by Rockstar Games, the creator tools enable players to enhance their game play experience by developing their own content. Through this functionality, the player community has already created and published over 2 million death matches and races. Consumers can look forward to more content from Grand Theft Auto Online in the future.", "In addition to supporting Grand Theft Auto Online, Rockstar Games plans to release substantial story driven downloadable add-on content for Grand Theft Auto V. They will have more to say about this in the coming months. For those who have not yet experienced the award-winning Sid Meier's Civilization V, or XCOM: Enemy Unknown from Firaxis Games, 2K will launch complete additions for each title for the PC. Featuring the full game plus all previously released add-on content, these additions represent a terrific value for consumers and another example of how we extend the lives of our franchises over time.", "We are also pursuing new opportunities to leverage our successful catalog offerings. 2K recently entered into a partnership with Bethesda to create two bundles featuring each publishers renowned titles in a single package. On February 11, 2K will release the Borderlands 2 & Dishonored Bundle, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim & BioShock Infinite Bundle, each available for the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. Also coming up, 2K will support BioShock Infinite with the release of BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea Part 2, the second add-on campaign set in the underwater city of Rapture before its fall.", "As mentioned by Strauss, we have a strong development pipeline including more than ten unique titles for next generation consoles with multiple releases planned for fiscal year 2015. Last month, 2K and Turtle Rock Studios, creators of the cooperative shooter classic, Left 4 Dead, unveiled Evolve, an exciting new intellectual property that is poised to be a generation defining multiplayer experience. Evolve, which will be available this fall for Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC, expertly blends cooperative and competitive multiplayer experiences as a team of four hunters faceoff against a player controlled monster. Set on a futuristic, deadly alien planet, gamers hunt their prey in adrenalin pumping four versus one matches. Players will experience Evolve as either a first person shooter when playing cooperatively as the four hunters or in the third person when playing as a monster, providing unique game play experience.", "2K have kicked off the pre-order campaign for Evolve featuring a Monster Expansion Pack. This includes the Savage Goliath skin at launch and a new monster character as soon as it becomes available after the game is released. In addition, during fiscal 2015, consumers can look forward to exciting next generation releases from our NBA 2K and WWE franchises as well as other unannounced titles that promise to raise the bar for excellence. We will have more to share about our titles throughout the next several months as we head into E3.", "As we enter the final months of fiscal year 2014, we are proud of our accomplishments and proven ability to set new standards for creativity and innovation. Looking forward, we are more enthusiastic than ever about our outlook to continue to deliver our industries most groundbreaking products which will translate into revenue and profits for our shareholders. In closing, I would like to join Strauss in thanking all of our colleagues for their contributions to our continuous success.", "I will now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon everyone. Today I'll review our results for the fiscal third quarter and then discuss our updated outlook for fiscal 2014 and our initial outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter . All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP results from continuing operations and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our results for the fiscal third quarter. Net revenue increased 90% to $767.7. This exceeded our outlook range of $650 million to $700 million due primarily to the continued success of Grand Theft Auto V, the record breaking launch of NBA 2K14 and the strong performance of Grand Theft Auto Online. Revenue from digitally delivered content grew 42% year-over-year and accounted for $132.8 million of net revenue. The largest contributors were the Grand Theft Auto series, the NBA 2K franchise and offerings for Borderlands 2 and BioShock Infinite. Catalog sales accounted for $113 million of net revenue, led by Borderlands 2, the Grand Theft Auto franchise, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, BioShock Infinite and Civilization V.", "Gross margin decreased 2.4 percentage points to 44.7% due primarily to higher internal royalties. Operating expenses were approximately $127 million, up by about $16 million, due primarily to higher marketing expenses to support our third quarter releases, continued marketing expense of Grand Theft Auto V, and higher personal expenses due to our increased headcount.", "Interest and other expense was $0.7 million. And non-GAAP net income was $210.7 million or $1.70 per share as compared to $78.8 million or $0.67 per share in fiscal third quarter 2013. This exceeded our outlook range of $1.20 to $1.35 per share due primarily to our better than expected results from operations. On a GAAP basis, we reported revenue of $1.86 billion and net income from continuing operations of $578.4 million or $4.69 per share.", "Turning to some key items from our balance sheet at December 31, 2013 as compared to September 30, 2013. Our cash balance increased to $972.2 million. Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $189.5 million, primarily reflecting collection of receivables associated with the launch of Grand Theft Auto V near the end of the second quarter. Inventory decreased to $45 million, primarily due to the launch of NBA 2K14 in early October and shipments for replenishment orders of Grand Theft Auto V. And software development costs and licenses decreased to $193.8 million, reflecting the amortization of development costs for our fiscal 2014 releases.", "Now I will review our financial outlook for the full-year and fourth quarter fiscal 2014, which is all provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are increasing our financial outlook for fiscal 2014 primarily to reflect our strong third quarter results and lower share count due to our repurchase of 16.24 million shares in November. We now expect non-GAAP net revenues to range from $2.35 billion to $2.38 billion and non-GAAP net income to range from $4.15 per share to $4.25 per share. These would be record results for our company.", "Turning to the details of our full year outlook. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 70% from Rockstar Games and 30% from 2K. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 50% United States and 50% international. We expect gross margins in the low 40s. Total operating expenses are expected to remain approximately flat from the prior year. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 10% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. We project interest and other expense of approximately $11 million, tax expense of about $14 million and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 121 million. This reflects weighted average basic shares of approximately 84 million, 11 million participating shares for unvested stock-based compensation awards, and 26 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the if-converted method of accounting.", "Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. We expect non-GAAP net revenue to range from $170 million to $200 million and non-GAAP net income to range from breakeven to $0.10 per share. The majority of our revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to come from NBA 2K14, Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, Borderlands 2 and WWE 2K14. We expect fourth quarter gross margins in the low 50s. Total operating expenses are expected to decrease by approximately 16% from the prior year's fourth quarter, driven primarily by lower selling and marketing expense. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 16% of net revenue, based on the mid-point of our outlook range.", "Our fourth quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $2 million, tax expense of about $1 million, and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 115 million. This reflects weighted average basic shares of approximately 77 million, 12 million participating shares for unvested stock-based compensation awards, and 26 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes under the if-converted method of accounting.", "Today Take-Two stands on the strongest financial foundation in the history of our company. This was achieved through our ability to balance leading-edge creative endeavors with a disciplined approach to capital investment. We are confident that our continued focus will enable Take-Two to deliver profits and returns to our shareholders over the long term. Of course, none of this will be possible without the hard work of our entire team, who I would like to thank for their dedication to the company. Thank you.", "Now I will turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our associates for their ongoing commitment to excellence. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can you talk a little bit about, or kind of remind us of what you said about the GTA Online usage? I think you said 70% of the people who are online connected, have played online, repeat that. And then what are people doing in there and paying for so far and what's your outlook going forward. Thank you.", "Karl Slatoff", "Justin, it's Karl. What we have said is that 70% of the folks who are playing, have played the game with an internet connection, have played GTA Online. Okay.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And those that are paying, what are they paying for currently and how do you see the opportunity going forward?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, first of all we are very optimistic about the opportunity, things are going very well and we are very happy with how things are going in GTA Online. Lots of great content is out there already and a lot of great content is on its way. So obviously have a very positive outlook for the future. In terms of what they are doing online, I would have expected that you would have played it by now, but otherwise there are a lot of different ways that you can enjoy the content online. There are predetermined death matches that -- your standard Deathmatch, your races, in the sense of buying we have a GTA cash back. So in order to experience some of the game, you can buy cash backs and that allows you unlock certain content, items that you can buy etcetera. So it's a standard online transaction model that you would see.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. And then when you think about your big franchises, moving them to mobile over time, how much untapped opportunity do you see for the company? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "We don\u2019t really distinguish between mobile and non-mobile. Our view is that a platform that a consumer wants to use to experience the best in interactive entertainment is good for us. And the only question is what are the processing limitations, the graphic limitations, which is why we put out some of our older titles on tablets but not as many of our newer titles because of the processing limitations or the power of those tablets as they currently exist. If you believe in Moore's law, and I do, than you believe that tablets will be tantamount to PCs pretty soon. And I have every reason to believe that if that\u2019s where people want to consumer video games, that\u2019s where we will be.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research", "So just to circle back to the last couple of questions on GTA Online. You had a couple of starts and stops with respect to the online currency for GTA Online. Do you think that you have made up for any sort of lost revenue and can you just take us through the timing of that, when that went back online? Was that towards the end of the quarter and is there maybe some catch-up to happen here in the March quarter?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes, I mean I have made it plain that we been learning as we, all along, in this area. And our primary goal is to delight consumers and create a great experience. As you know, GTA Online is a free to play experience and there is opportunities for recurrent consumer spending within the game, and no obligation of course. But we have sold in 32.5 million units of Grand Theft Auto V. We have enjoyed an extraordinary economic result. But the starting point for that economic result is delighting consumers, giving them a fantastic experience. And that\u2019s our focus in GTA Online. And the reason that we offer an opportunity to spend money in the game is that\u2019s coordinated with a great experience. We are not making decisions in order to extract value, we are making decisions to delight consumers. And that includes creating value.", "Yes, we had some issues with the currency. Those issues have been addressed and we are not really focused on whether the catch-up or anything of this sort. You know as long as people keep loving GTA Online it's going to be great for us.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research", "Great. And then I guess along those same lines. I don't know how much you are querying your user base or following any sort of metrics that would just maybe give us some insight as to whatever color you might have with respect to just how sustainable you think this GTA Online experience can be. Maybe through the release of other high octane games that have come out within the industry, did we see a drop in the number of people that were online? You know how long can this go?", "Strauss Zelnick", "You know, James, I am so thrilled to be asked to answer your how high is up question because it's sort of novel for us around here. Look, we are thrilled. We are just thrilled. And we certainly are following metrics very carefully and we are growing our expertise every day. We made it plain that we prefer to expand resources after we see revenues not before. It's protected us greatly. We are very disciplined. And that means we are learning as we go. But the watchword here is about delighting consumers and keeping them engaged, not about monetization. The monetization comes with the engagement. My own view is, I feel very, very optimistic about GTA Online and I think there is plenty more opportunity and we have made no bones about the fact that we have expectations for GTA Online in the fourth quarter, for example. So clearly we have expectations going forward but we are not at a point yet where we want to share the metrics.", "James Hardiman - Longbow Research", "Very helpful. And I guess just last question, Strauss. I mean the performance of your company over the past six months, certainly since GTA has come out, has been through the roof. Hopefully, tomorrow will be a different story, but your stock has been essentially sideways over that time. I guess you seem surprised that your stock hasn't done more. It seems like you have gotten out a lot more and talked to investors. What would they like to see to reward your shares more commensurately with your performance and, I guess, are there two ways to skin this cat? You're sitting here with cash that represents half the market cap of your company. What's in tap? What could you potentially do to get people more excited about the shares, just given your cash position? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "You know I have never met a CEO who didn\u2019t think his or her stock was undervalued. And we are not in the business of pumping stock, we are in the business of trying to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient entertainment company that exists. And I am really proud that in the last seven years, every year we have launched a new multimillion unit selling franchise. I am really proud that we have the best collection of owned intellectual property business. I am incredibly gratified that I believe we have the top collection of creative talent within our walls and they seem to be happy to work here and, moreover, that they love following their passions. And that, the collection of that strategy and that execution as Lainie said, has yielded an extraordinary financial result.", "And we sit here today once again beating our guidance for the sixth quarter in a row. Once again increasing our outlook now to $4.15 to $4.25 a share. I sit here with the ability to say in confidence that we expect to be profitable in the next fiscal year on a non-GAAP basis and profitable on an ongoing basis for the foreseeable future. And finally, we have nearly $1 billion in cash and based on the way we account for our convert, one could argue that\u2019s in the context of no debt since we account for our converted notes returned in equity. That\u2019s an amazing place to be in what is a relatively short time since we came to this party. And we are immensely grateful for it. What do I surmise? Look, sometimes the market takes a long time to come to a view of where we are and where we going. And once I asked one of our very sophisticated investors as why the stock had gone down and he said to me, more sellers than buyers. So I am convinced that if we keep executing on this vision and our entire team stays focused on what their passionate about and we all work really, really hard, I am convinced that there will be a narrowing gap between our reality and how the market sees us.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Handler - MKM Partners", "Just a couple of questions for you. With regards to GTA Online, you said 70% who have played with an internet connection have played GTA Online. Just curious, what percentage of that 70% have actually been monetized with some type of micro-transaction? And then, secondly, with regards to your balance sheet, if you just look at it from a net cash perspective and let's treat the converts as debt, you've got over $500 million of cash. Is there a certain amount of cash that you want on hand at all time for operational purposes? And it looks like you really didn't buyback any more stock after the announcement that you made in late November about repurchasing the Icahn shares and then 4 point, some odd million shares on the open market. Have you bought any since that time?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes. We are not talking about the percent that have monetized. We are disclosing those metrics. And that\u2019s primarily because it's still a work in progress. In terms of the balance sheet, there absolutely is a base amount of cash on hand in the several hundred million range to make sure that we can continue to make and market the highest quality products. Without regard to the fact that now and then things don\u2019t go our way, we were fortunate that we have been profitable a lot lately and we have been able to be profitable in multiple years without a frontline release of Grand Theft Auto and that was stated strategy. And of course when we do have a frontline release of Grand Theft Auto, we have been very fortunate with those results as well. So it's been a lot of good news around here.", "But not everything always goes our way. We have had disappointing releases and we are a pure play entertainment company, there is an element of volatility baked into that. And the ability to play another day, the ability to bettering your releases, the ability to spend a good deal of money in development and marketing, is highly correlated with success in entertainment. Which is why across all entertainment content businesses, and I have been involved with all of them over the course of my career, the rich get richer if they can keep delivering.", "Now we are -- I am fond of saying, you have heard me say it before, arrogance is the enemy of continued success. We don\u2019t take anything for granted. We don\u2019t claim continued success as a matter of right. Our team --honestly, when I talk to our creative folks about how wonderful the Metacritic rating was or how great something went, inevitably what they explain to me is not how great they are, but first they tell me that it was the team's responsibility not theirs, they just claim responsibility because that\u2019s our culture. And then the second thing they do, is point out the things that didn\u2019t go as well as they wanted and the areas that we need to improve in. And it's that culture that I think protect us that even so now and then we get things wrong and need to be protected so our team can always safe in investing behind their passions and can feel same in marketing our products in the highest class way possible.", "In terms of capital in excess of that amount, and I think we agree we have that now, we do have some converts out there. It's nice to have some flexibility in terms of redemption, even though account for them as though they will be redeemed in equity. And we have purchased $277 million of stock and now we have no new announcements on that since those purchases. And we have made no bones about the fact that we would be very interested in highly accretive M&A. And let me emphasize highly accretive, and by that I do not mean speculatively, so I mean actually. So we will continue to grow organically in a disciplined way. Given that we are in a high risk business, we are very focused on risk mitigation. We are focused on, in a measured way, looking for strategic opportunities to grow inorganically. And we absolutely have our eyes wide open about returning more capital to the shareholders.", "Eric Handler - MKM Partners", "Okay. And then just one quick follow-up question. When you look at a successful title or any of your titles, and the DLC that you have launched above and beyond that, I wondered if you could just give a range of the incremental upside that you get from a franchise above and beyond the physical release, on average what that looks like?", "Strauss Zelnick", "It is a general focus. We haven't given out more color because the numbers are all over the place. As you would imagine and as it becomes sort of obvious but it's worth mentioning, the more successful the original release the more successful the downloadable content. The more important recurrent consumer spending becomes for the title.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olsen with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Olsen - Piper Jaffray", "I just had one quick one here on Evolve. You provided some details on the game but can you maybe give us an idea if this is really going to be kind of the one big non-recurring title that you plan to launch in 2014?", "Karl Slatoff", "I am sorry, what do you mean by non-recurring title?", "Michael Olsen - Piper Jaffray", "As in like, NBA 2K is an annual title.", "Karl Slatoff", "I see, yes. Like we said before, we have announced that we have got unannounced titles in development at this point. We haven't given any other disclosure of this fact. But obviously that is one large one that we have announced for the year, but other than that we have got nothing more to say.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research", "Two questions, if I might. One, if you look across the cycle that's pretty much just done, although GTA is keeping the current cycle going for those gamers. What percentage of your revenues over the course of the last cycle came from GTA? And given, compared to the last cycle where you didn't have a BioShock, a Borderlands and didn't have as successful a Red Dead, can you give us a scale of how that distribution changed cycle to cycle and where it might go in the new one? And then secondly, Strauss, relative to your comments on making accretive M&A, if you look over the last four or five years, there has been a lot of M&A in video game land ad I think most people would agree that not a lot of it has been accretive, at least not for very long. As you look at opportunities and given your experience in broader media, would a deal have to be in video games itself or might you look to broaden the scope of what Take-Two does in terms of the mediums it serves?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes, we don\u2019t have the numbers in front of us in sort of comparing this launch and our other titles to the last launch, GTA 4 and other titles. It would be very hard to do that apples to apples because, obviously, it's not as where we have all of the release schedules of all of the titles in lockstep. We do have a lot more big franchises today than we had when we launched GTA 4 and we are very grateful for that, because as I said, we have launched at least one new intellectual property that\u2019s sold millions of unit every year since 2007, I believe. So I think you can safely assume that the perspective is lower now than it was before. But beyond that I don\u2019t think we can give much color.", "In terms of M&A, look, you are a hundred percent right. The track record of the industry is not wonderful, although Activision has done some very clever transactions, I would argue, and their stock price reflects that. But across the board it hasn\u2019t been a pretty story. And we just don\u2019t believe in pie in the sky, we barely believe pie right in front of us unless we are eating it. So I think the answer it, strategy really matters, execution may not or more than strategy. And would we contemplate other forms of digital entertainment in addition to pure video game entertainment, we would contemplate that. But beyond that we don\u2019t have much else to say now and certainly nothing to announce.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Company", "First off, if you could provide any perspective on the efforts required to bring a franchise like GTA V over to other platforms, if that's more or less a traditional port? Or does Rockstar have somewhat higher standards that require something more in-depth in terms of extensions? And then on the digital strategy, I know as a content company you have to decide how much infrastructure and servers and networking to build yourselves versus relying on others, in your case, like Sony and Microsoft. So my question is, looking ahead, based on your experiences to date, do your platform partners have those pieces to serve your content as you'd like to your customers or do you foresee any need to build any additional infrastructure to support your particular online initiative?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We are going to leave it to our labels to talk about what happens with their properties going forward. We think that\u2019s -- I know at times, on these calls people would like me to talk much more about upcoming releases and sometimes there is some frustration that we don\u2019t. The truth is though, we are trying to provide as much transparency as we can to our shareholders and leave the marketing decisions and the marketing announcements to our labels, because that\u2019s where we maximize our sales. So once again, Rockstar will make appropriate announcements about the releases as they come as well 2K. And as they make those announcements and of course we will reference them here, but let me emphasize that we fell very optimistic about our outlook going forward and very encouraged by the results we have had to date.", "In terms of infrastructure, look, the world is going to -- you know resources are outsourced and cloud computing, that\u2019s hardly a secret. And we have zero interest in building out massive facilities and spending a great deal of money on CapEx. I don\u2019t expect that we will see very significant CapEx investment. I think the bulk of our needs will be handled by third parties, whether that\u2019s our hardware partners or other third parties that help provide the capacity to have us meet consumers where they are. But, no, we are not building call centers, data centers or server fronts.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.", "Ben Schachter - Macquarie Research", "First one for Lainie. Lainie, cash and accounts receivable of about $1.2 billion, accrued expenses are about $600 million, and I assume most of that are the internal royalties. What does that look like by the end of the fiscal year? I'm basically just trying to get a sense of really what the net cash looked like. And then if you could talk about, are you going to be cash flow positive for '15? And then, Strauss or Karl, in general, do you expect any meaningful change in the overall business model with Microsoft and Sony this gen or will the business model basically look like the last gen?", "Lainie Goldstein", "For the cash flow for the remainder of this year, we see that we will be cash flow neutral. We are not giving out guidance for '15 yet, so we are not giving out cash flow expectations for that period either. And the overall balance sheet also, we don\u2019t give out projections on the balance sheet but it should be in line with how the P&L flows for the next quarter.", "Karl Slatoff", "Ben, it's Karl. First of all, we are thrilled with the launch of the next gen consoles. We are very very excited about how things are going right now as I know Microsoft and Sony are. In terms of the changes in business model between us, I don\u2019t anticipate anything meaningful at all.", "Ben Schachter - Macquarie Research", "If I could just follow up with one, maybe Strauss, assuming that Google, Amazon, and Apple continue to press forward with their digital media initiatives and very likely that they will have their own boxes as they get more content to television screens. How does that impact how you think about the business?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, good news. Because more distribution to consumers on a multiplicity of devices is a good thing. And we have reason to believe that it's going to be easier and easier to develop in a way that we can be readily available without too much porting expense across a multiplicity of platforms. If it costs money to port, and or course it does, then we have to make an economic decision based on who we think we are going to find a the other end. And that\u2019s a balancing act. We have invested heavily behind both Microsoft and Sony. It looks like, as Karl said, that\u2019s going to pay off and it's beginning to pay off. We are thrilled about that. But our goal is to be where the consumer is and to be utterly ecumenical about other people's platform as long as the economic model is reasonable. So I think the answer is, we intend to be everywhere.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.", "Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "So I noticed that Evolve has not been announced for old gen systems and I think in your prepared remarks you noted the NBA 2K and WWE 2K would be available on new gen. Is that any indication as to your plans to support old gen going forward? And then the second question pertains to GTA V. There has been a lot of scuttlebutt or speculation that it will be available on PC shortly. I'm not asking for a forecast on that, but can you give us some context, history with GTA prior titles on the PC? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff", "Drew, it's Karl. In terms of the old gen versus new gen question, I would say that any of our announcements that we have made to date don\u2019t necessarily reflect our plans whether something is going to be specifically for next get or old gen. It really is more a function of what we have announced, what platforms we have announced that they are going to be on at this point. So we haven't said anything about Evolve but for the next gen platforms, we have haven't said anything about our NBA titles -- but for next gen platforms -- our sports titles but for next gen platforms. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we are not going on current gen, rather we are going on current gen, it's not related at this point. It just means we haven't had anything to share.", "In terms of GTA V, I think you asked about PC?", "Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Correct, yes.", "Karl Slatoff", "Yes. At this point there is really nothing for us to say about that, Drew. We haven't announced anything as it relates to any of the platforms versus what's out there.", "Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Karl, I'm just trying to get a sense as to how it's performed on PC with prior iterations. Again, I'm not asking for a release date....", "Karl Slatoff", "You are talking about GTA 4?", "Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Correct.", "Lainie Goldstein", "It's been a very strong PC title.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with CRT Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Neil Doshi - CRT Capital", "56% of your revenue came from international this quarter. I think it's the highest we have seen in years. Can you provide any color as to what drove that strong international sales and how material was NBA 2K China? And then on GTA Online, any thoughts on eventually making that a mobile opportunity, just in order to keep people engaged in the franchise when they are away from their consoles or big screens? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes. You know the average selling prices translated into U.S. dollars is higher outside of U.S. than inside the U.S. So we certainly benefit from that. We also benefit from our strategy to make sure that our international distribution very strong worldwide. Years ago we made a big push into Asia through our headquarters in Singapore and we are reaping the benefits of that. And obviously with the sales of the GTA V, we are seeing a benefit internationally. We also have seen a lot of growth in Latin America. We are pleased with that. So we continue to focus on building our international business and these results are very gratifying.", "In terms of mobile opportunities, again, we don\u2019t really distinguish between mobile and fix. We don\u2019t distinguish between tablet and PC, we don\u2019t distinguish between console and PC and tablet. We do distinguish between screen size, small, medium and large, because they accommodate different experiences. And we have our own limitations based on a platform's technical ability to serve our needs and consumers needs. But beyond that we are utterly ecumenical. And with regards specifically to GTA, I am sorry we have said it before, we are not talked about other releases yet. We are going to leave it to Rockstar to have those discussions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Hickey - Benchmark", "Just curious, on mobile, Strauss, it feels like there is a lot of value creation opportunity there for you. I know you have kind of experimented with premium, I think successfully, but it feels like how free to play is the answer here. And you're definitely seeing some games achieve some tremendous success in the market and I think more to come. It also seems like you're a big bull there. So just thinking about your IP cash, the development talent that you have and maybe that you acquire, it seems like a no-brainer here to be more aggressive on the mobile side. So just hopefully you can share with us your strategic vision on how you are seeing mobile and how impactful it can be for you in the future.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, I don\u2019t want to confuse mobile with free to play to model because you could have -- in China you have a free to play model on PCs obviously, which are largely wired. You have certainly free to plays with relatively common models for iPad and smartphones but there is also a pay to play model on iPad and smartphones. So I don\u2019t think mobile is the difference that makes a difference. I think the business model shifts depending on the geography, depending on the title, depending on what a consumer wants. So we have sold GTA V as a package good. We sold it as digitally downloadable title. We made GTA Online available free to play and there is an opportunity to spend money inside the game. For NBA 2K China online, it's free to play and there is an option to spend money within the game. So our business model reflects the title, the geography, what consumers want. Whether it's mobile or wired is of no consequence.", "Mike Hickey - Benchmark", "I mean mobile appears to be a hyper growth market. And is it something that you plan to put more resources towards? I think part of the problem with your valuation is that in a lot of people's minds, you are still stuck to the console and I think for the most part, the majority of performance is console driven. But you look at the trends that are shaping our future, mobile is a big part of them. So do you expect to put more resources there? I mean is this something that you look for in M&A? Any other thoughts would be appreciated.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Again I don\u2019t -- I think I view mobile differently than you do Mike. Because the content isn't mobile, the content can be anywhere. The question is, how heavy is it? What kind of processing power is required for the graphics and the game play. And right now we don\u2019t have the ability to take a game that we put on -- what is now currently on consoles and put it on to an iPad, because an iPad doesn\u2019t have the processing power to allow that. But I am a believer that it will. And when it does, I have every reason to believe that we will support that with current releases because that\u2019s history of what we have done. Right now, we are putting up some of our older titles on iPad and other tablets because they support the titles and we are able to delight consumers and make money as we do it. I am a big bull on where mobile platforms are going and I think they are great entertainment platforms. If they can support what we do creatively, than we will be there and if they can't, then we will have to wait until they can.", "If you are asking, can we create experiences specifically for mobile, we have done that as well with limited success, frankly. So if what you are saying is you think that we ought to be more attuned to companies that create lighter experience specifically for what current mobile platforms can do, for example, Zynga just bought a company, NaturalMotion, that does that. They do what some people call new core experiences. Then I have no quarrel with NaturalMotion or with the strategy. But I think the answer is, from our point of view, is there an opportunity that makes sense to do that and does it fit with our DNA. And I know so far. The stuff that we have -- the bespoke stuff that we have done for these lighter platforms has enjoyed limited success.", "Mike Hickey - Benchmark", "Fair enough, thanks. Last question, if I can. It is kind of a perception, at least my perception, that as you have these next gen early adopters, and obviously it has been a big success here initially out of the gate, that maybe they are leaving the online play experience in GTA as they upgrade the console experience. And maybe the impact is not as significant right now because there's really a lack of quality content. But are you seeing, and I know you are hesitant to share engagement, but is that reasonable to expect that as people upgrade that, they are not playing on prior-gen machines?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Look we were selling PS2 products until very recently. If you have great quality titles it's remarkable how long people will continue to consume them. I know some of our competitors have expressed that they have seen a big fall off in what is now old gen catalog. But we have made it plain that we haven't seen such a fall off and that\u2019s reflected in our very strong third quarter results where our catalog performed as well. So I think you are right, as the new platforms gain momentum, we hope they will, software is made available for them, a lot of the consumers will turn their attention to that and that\u2019s why we have more than ten titles in development for these new platforms and why are sounding very enthusiastic an optimistic about our future.", "Equally, we remain very enthusiastic about our catalog which continues to sell more units per SKU than anyone else's catalog overtime. Why is that? Because we have the highest quality in the business according to Metacritics for the past five years. And we don\u2019t rest on our laurels because we know that\u2019s the past five years, we got to do it every day. And we take that mission very seriously indeed.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "First of all, some quick questions. Lainie, can you just clarify that the rise that we saw in the accrued expenses, is that related to internal royalties, or is it something else that's driving that increase?", "Lainie Goldstein", "I can't confirm the exact details of the account but it was to do with certain items for compensation, for our incentive compensation plan, as well as other items that would have been driven from the top line of the quarter.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then how much of your cash is onshore?", "Lainie Goldstein", "60% is in the U.S. and 40% is international.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then the last one of these questions is, looking at headcount at quarter end, where was that number?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We had a total of 2500 employees at the end of the quarter and approximately 1800 were development employees.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then, Strauss, just to look at your perspective that you should maintain profitability in fiscal year 2015 and beyond, can you comment a little bit about what is driving that view? Is it your knowledge about cost control in that time period? Is it your visibility around revenue? What's driving that comfort level at this point?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, as you would imagine it's our pipeline in development, our anticipated release schedule, the costs related to development, costs related to marketing, and the expectations of performance within a range. And of course, there is a degree of additional cushion provided by our views as to our catalog and recurrent consumer spending related to releases that are already in the marketplace.", "Edward Williams - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then your thoughts about the transition that we're seeing right now? Obviously, you have commented that you are pretty enthusiastic about the adoption rate of the new consoles, but what's your perspective about the health of the retailers and kind of the retailers inventory levels?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We haven't had any issues with our retailers at all. They remain our most important channel partner. And there were some issues in the U.K. sometime ago but it's been a relatively robust and quiet market for us.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Fitzgerald - Jefferies", "Following on the same line of questioning on the next gen consoles, can you give us a sense of the percentage of users that are downloading full games versus buying at retail? And then current gen versus next gen, are you seeing any behavioral differences in terms of engagement, or tie [ph] issues, or willingness to download DLC, etcetera?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Brian, it's too early for us to have a view on that. Because remember, it's a relatively small population of what is now this new generation of consoles out there. And we wouldn\u2019t seek to make those comparisons yet. But in any case, we don\u2019t run our business based on that data, it doesn\u2019t tell us anything. We could know a tie [ph] ratio but it doesn\u2019t change our behavior.", "Brian Fitzgerald - Jefferies", "Okay. And then really quickly, it's going to be early, too, but any early impact or signals you are seeing from demand in China from the console standpoint?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Way too early to say. There are no consoles launched there.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company", "It's a pretty quick one. You mentioned you have a lot of store based GTA V content in development. Can you just say whether your March quarter guidance contemplates any of that being released in the March quarter? Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes, we haven't given any color on that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Larry Haverty with GAMCO Investors. Please proceed with your question.", "Larry Haverty - GAMCO Investors", "Strauss, it seems to me the market, looking at the way the stock is acting, the market is penalizing you for these converts, and they are kind of extraordinary instruments. Could you walk through when they are able to be converted and the conversion price at this point? And then I have a follow-up on that.", "Lainie Goldstein", "The first convert that we have in the market is the $250 million one. It matures on December 2016. And the second one $287 million, matures in July of 2018.", "Larry Haverty - GAMCO Investors", "And what are the coupons on those right now?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, the strike price on the first one is $19.09 and the strike on the second one is $21.52.", "Larry Haverty - GAMCO Investors", "So you have the ability right now, if you were to -- I am not sure where these things are trading -- take away almost 30% of the common shares for basically half of the cash. And that would seem to me to be an extraordinarily good trade, because the way the accounting is, it's very hard for someone to economically figure out whether the share count is 84 million or 125 million. It's a huge gap between actual shares outstanding in the quarter and the potential dilution using the if-converted method and I think it is wreaking havoc on the way investors are valuing your stock. And the idea of it, these converts have an economic purpose, given the cash position and an efficient capital allocation I think is a bit presumptuous. Could you discuss these issues?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We have -- there are obviously limitations in our ability to redeem before a certain period of time, it's built in to the indenture, as you know, Larry. But we do back out the number of shares, I think Lainie quoted $26 million of shares that's tied to it. So you can easily back that out of the weighted average of shares and....", "Lainie Goldstein", "And you had asked, sorry, the coupon on them is 1.75% on the first one and 1% on the second one.", "Strauss Zelnick", "They were highly efficient capital instruments when we launched them and I greatly respect your view with the market and how the market sees the converts. I think they still represent a very positive source of capital to the company. But in any case they are rather low coupon instruments with rather high, in the case of second one, strike prices compared with the current market price in case of the second one. And of course when we launched the first convert it was significantly higher than the stock price at that time. But in any case there are limitations on how we go about redeeming them that we must observe.", "Larry Haverty - GAMCO Investors", "Buy them in the open market though, right?", "Strauss Zelnick", "I suppose we have the ability to -- it's a way that we could return cash to shareholders.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Strauss Zelnick for any closing comments.", "Strauss Zelnick", "I just want to thank you all for joining us today. We are exceedingly pleased with our results and I am immensely grateful to our shareholders and of course primarily grateful to all of our colleagues all over the world who once again have hit it out of the park. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Fiscal 2014 was a record-breaking year for Take-Two. Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V reached billion dollars in sales, faster than any entertainment release in history. NBA 2K14 enjoyed the franchises' strongest launch. Borderlands 2 became 2K's top selling title, and our digitally delivered revenue grew to its highest level ever.", "As a result of these achievements we generated record revenue, earnings and cash flow for our shareholders. We ended the year with nearly a billion dollars in cash after spending $277 million to repurchase our stock at a meaningful discount to today's share price.", "The highlight of our fiscal year was the worldwide launch of Grand Theft Auto V.

NBA 2K14 was our first next-generation title, and already has surpassed NBA 2K13 as the top performing release in the franchises' history with sell-in of more than 6.5 million units to-date. Moreover the title has dominated next-generation sports sales, surpassing both FIFA and Madden as the third highest selling title of any genre on PS4 and Xbox One in the United States according to the NPD Group.", "Borderlands 2, which launched in September 2012, continue to be a significant contributor to our results. The title was the top selling release in history of 2K with over 9 million units sold in to-date. An important driver of Borderlands 2 success has been its superb array of add-on offerings. During fiscal 2014, 2K released eight new downloadable content packs with the title as well as the Game of the Year Edition. The Borderlands franchise was launched less than five years ago and has quickly become one of the most beloved brands in interactive entertainment. We look forward to expanding it with new offerings in the coming year.", "Our fiscal 2014 results also benefited from the successful launch of WWE 2K14 and continuing demand for Grand Theft Auto IV, BioShock Infinite, which is now sold in more than 6 million units, and offerings for Sid Meier's Civilization V. The February release of Civilization V, a complete edition marked the final offering for this title which is sold in over 5 million units and it's supported by two critically claimed expansion packs along with the selection of downloadable content.

During fiscal 2014, recurrent consumer spending accounted for nearly 50% of our record $435 million in digitally delivered revenue, and approximately 75% of its growth.", "Revenue from Grand Theft Auto online outperformed our expectations in the fourth quarter, and was the single largest contributor to our digitally delivered revenue in the fiscal year. More than 70% of those who played Grand Theft Auto V while connected to the Internet played Grand Theft Auto online.

We encourage you to stop by our booth and see how we are build and are trying to delivering the most groundbreaking offerings in our industry.", "Rockstar Games will continue to support both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto online with new concept updates including the upcoming launch of cooperative high commissions which will allow players to work together in new ways for substantial rewards.

Today I will review our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014, and then discuss our outlook for the first quarter fiscal 2015. All the numbers that I will be providing today are non-GAAP results from continuing operations and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise dated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurement.", "Starting with our results for the fiscal first quarter, net revenue decreased 23% to $233.2 million as last year's fourth quarter quarter benefited in the release of BioShock Infinite, and we had no significant releases during this year's fourth quarter. This exceeded our outlook range of $170 million to $200 million due primarily to the continued strong performance of the Grand Theft Auto series.", "Digitally delivered revenue grew 51% and accounted for $122.3 million of net revenue. The largest contributor to digital sales with the Grand Theft Auto series, the NBA 2K franchise, and offerings to Borderlands 2; approximately 60% was divided from recurrent consumer spending. Catalog sales accounted for $75.7 million of net revenue led by Borderlands 2, BioSchock Infinite, the Grand Theft Auto series and Civilization V.", "Gross margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 47.7% due primarily to higher internal royalties. Operating expenses were $88.1 million down by $16.7 million due primarily to our marketing expense. And just in other expense was $2.2 million and non-GAAP net income was $21.5 million or $0.21 per share as compared to $42.9 million or $0.38 per share in fiscal fourth quarter 2013. This result exceeded our outlook range of breakeven to $0.10 per share. On a GAAP basis, we reported revenue of $195.2 million (indiscernible) from continuing operations of $30.8 million or $0.40 per share.", "Turning now to our results in the full year; net revenue increased 97% for a record $2.4 billion. This growth is driven primarily by the extraordinary success of Grand Theft Auto V. Revenues in digitally delivered content grew 65% and accounted for $435.1 million of net revenue. The largest contributor to digital sales for offering of the Grand Theft Auto series, Borderlands 2, the NBA 2K franchise, Civilization V and BioShock Infinite. Nearly 50% was derived from the current consumer spending.", "Gross margin decreased 0.7 percentage points to 41.5% due primarily to higher internal royalty. Operating expenses were $468.5 up by $1.7 million in the higher personnel expenses in our development studio, higher professional fees and IT expenses and higher research and development costs, which were offset by lower selling and marketing expense and the absence of the $15 million one-time contractual obligation recognized in fiscal 2013.", "Interest and other expense was $10.8 million and non-GAAP net income of $510.7 million or $4.26 per share as compared to $33.1 million or $0.36 per share in fiscal 2013. On a GAAP basis, we recorded revenue of $2.4 billion and income from continuing operations of $361.7 million or $3.20 per share.", "Turning to some key items in the balance sheet at March 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013; our cash balance decreased to $935.4 million. Accounts receivable balance decreased to $53.1 million primarily reflecting a collection of receivables associated with our third quarter releases and holiday sales.", "Inventory decreased to $29.8 due primarily to shipments for the replenishment order of Grand Theft Auto V. And software development cost and licenses increased to $225.7 million affecting the developing efforts around our pipeline of upcoming releases.", "Now, I'll review our financial outlook for the first quarter in fiscal 2015, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. Starting with the full year, our initial outlook is non-GAAP net revenue to range from $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion and non-GAAP net income to range from $0.80 per share to $1.05 per share.", "Turning to the details of our full year outlook, majority of our revenue is expected to come from a state of announce new title including NBA 2K15, Evolve, WWE 2K15, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and Civilization: Beyond Earth, new releases that we have not yet announced and catalog sales led by the Grand Theft Auto series. We expect revenue breakdown from our owned labels to be roughly 45% from Rockstar Games and 55% from 2K. We expect the geographic revenue split to be about 55% United States and 45% international. We expect gross margins in the mid to upper 40.", "Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 14% driven primarily by higher selling and marketing expense to support our fiscal 2015 release schedule. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 20% of net revenue based on the mid point of our outlook range. New projects, interests and other fronts of approximately $9 million, tax expense is about $32 million and weighted average per diluted share is approximately 189. This reflects weighted average base of shares of approximately 81 million, 11 million participating shares for our unvested stock-based compensation awards, and 26 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible note under the \"if-converted\" method of accounting.", "As a result of working capital needs, we currently expect our operations do the modest amount of cash in fiscal 2015. Although we expect to generate cash from operations in fiscal 2015 and to be net cash flow positive over these two fiscal years.", "Turning to the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP net revenue to range from $120 million to $135 million and non-GAAP net loss to range from $0.25 to $0.35 per share. Majority of our revenue in the first quarter is expected to come from NBA 2K14 and Grand Theft Auto series and Borderlands 2. We expect first quarter gross margins in high 50. ", "So, operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 4% from the prior year's first quarter, primarily due to additional staffing at our studios to support all of these schedules.", "Selling and marketing expenses is expected to be about 30% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. Our first quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense to approximately $2 million no tax expense and weighted average shares of approximately 79 million.", "In closing, Take-Two's record results for fiscal 2014 would be to a global organization's ability to deliver the highest quality interactive entertainment within a disciplined fiscal framework. We had entered the current year with the strongest financial foundation in the hedging of our company. As a result, Take-Two is well positioned to proceed with numerous creative endeavors and also continuing to generate positive results for shareholders both in fiscal 2015 and over the long term. Thank you.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank our colleagues for delivering a record year and setting the foundation for a consistent long-term success. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.", "We will now take your question. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed.", "Eric Handler - MKM Partners", "Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Two things; first, when you look at your cash on hand, you're now sitting at about over $8 of cash, and I think investors were pleased that you guys returned some of the capital this year through your buybacks in the third quarter, but fourth quarter there was no buybacks. And given all the cash that you're sitting on and understanding that you're not expecting to generate any positive free cash flow in fiscal '15, is there anything in particular that you feel a need to just sit on that level of cash right now?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Eric for your question. We said before about the cash balance, and this is the high cost problem to have is that there are at least three potential users. One is to support our organics growth, and our history of organic growth around here is pretty great actually if you look over the course of the few years, the bulk of our growth indeed has been organic. And in certain instances, for example, our Asia initiatives we turned partnerships to make sure that we could both mitigate the risk and fund those growth opportunities at the time when we were capital constrained. Thankfully those constraints are lifted. Those opportunities have largely turned out to be very beneficial, and now we are in a position to finance more organic growth internally.", "Secondly, there is the opportunity for inorganic growth driven by acquisitions. We've been really selective about acquisitions and I don't expect that our discipline will be in any way reduced. Historically when we acquired something as the intersection of our high quality team with high quality owned intellectual property and that is to lens through which we tend to look at the world. And we are not interested in pie in the sky deals; we are only interested in accretive deals. But again our balance sheet now gives us the opportunity to look at those deals in a more fulsome way.", "And finally, in the last year we had demonstrated a desire to return cash to the shareholders by buying back $277 million of our stock. We do have an open authorization for share repurchase, and we will contemplate that as well. So there are any number of options in front of us and that's the palette from which we can choose; it's the nice position to be in.", "Eric Handler - MKM Partners", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up more for Lainie. Your G&A in the fourth quarter was $51 million and that seems to be a line item that fluctuates quite a bit quarter to quarter. How should we think about that line as we sort of progress through fiscal '15?", "?", "Lainie Goldstein", "G&A usually stays pretty flat from quarter-to-quarter and that will probably in line with next year's -- with last year's balance. The way to look at it though is it can depend on -- there is a one-time write off or something in last year in 2013, we had a one-time $15 million contractual obligation that we had written off during that period, but otherwise it should be pretty flat to last year's number.", "Eric Handler - MKM Partners", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Justin Post - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Obviously you have quite an installed base for Grand Theft Auto V and not a lot about your plans there, I'm sure Rockstar is part of that, but what can you tell us about how digital is tracking versus your expectations? And how that has factored into your guidance for next year? And then bigger picture, next year 2015 it's expected to be a big year for the console cycle, so next calendar year. How are Rockstar and Take-Two approaching what could be finally a growth year for software sales next calendar year? Thank you.", "", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah. I think when you talk about digital, I assume you mean recurring consumer spending related to Grand Theft Auto online, and we've said as that continues to be a very good story indeed and if anything has exceeded our expectations. It's early days yet. And there was a lot of great content out there. There is great engagement. We all are anxious to see how that develops, but by any standard that's a very good story and Grand Theft Auto online, the big generator for recurring consumer spending for us.", "And I'm glad you are optimistic about what next-gen, your next-gen rollout looks like in the coming calendar year. We tend to he highly optimistic as well. We have more than 10 titles in development for next-gen. We've had a great experience with our basketball title which is number one sports title for next-gen and the number to be tighter overall for next-gen from last fall. So we've announced a number of titles. We've said we have more titles to announce for this fiscal year and for the future. And the fact that the installed base looks sound and growing is potentially a benefit for us.", "As far as Rockstar goes, we've confirmed that they are hard at work and their current lineup, and we are very excited about what they have in store through for next-gen systems in this fiscal year.", "Justin Post - Merrill Lynch", "Great, and maybe one follow up. Will Rockstar have a presence at E3 this year?", "Karl Slatoff", "Hi Jeff, this is Karl. This far Rockstar hasn't announced that they are going to be attending E3.", "Justin Post - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research. Please proceed.", "Daniel Ernst \u2013 Hudson Square Research", "Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking my call. A couple questions if I might, first, if you look at your line up for this coming year, you have a very balanced portfolio of titles coming out, which is a nice thing following a big blockbuster year with GTA. Without giving guidance beyond that, is that kind of a balanced portfolio approach that you can have in subsequent years, where you don't have as big of swings in between the GTA, can you just give us a sense of how you're timing and allocating resources to have a more consistent earnings schedule? And then as related question, if you look at your R&D budget including capitalized expenses, how much of that is dedicated towards new IP versus putting out new versions of previously successful IP? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah, thanks Daniel. I think you have identified the way that you are penciling out, and it's a reflection of our strategy. So historically what we found when we came to the company some years was a company that we dominated by one franchise and operated within one business model. Everyone knows what franchise was and the business model was clearly game, and put in the box and you ship it, and then maybe you ship with budget addition or again your addition. And perhaps you ship some expansion packs.", "Well, in the past seven years we have launched a multiplicity of new franchises. The company now has 10 franchises that have each sold at least 5 million units for an individual release. And in terms of business model we and frankly the rest of the industry are diversified, so that we have revenue that comes after the initial release of the game. It's not related just to the sale of a full game whether that's digital or physical governor. And we call that recurring consumer spending.", "What's exciting about the coming year and subsequent years is in sort of both of those features that will release in the balance portfolio of franchises year in year out in addition to new intellectual property that we hope will become new franchises. And we are aggressively pursuing this new business model, which means that we make the game available physically, we make it available digitally, we make downloadable content available when it made sense. And we are going to make sense, we allow consumers to engage in the game both in terms of game play and in terms of spending money. We call that recurring consumer spending.", "That's become a very powerful engine here both creatively and economically. Of course we start with the creative engine and then we move on to the economic engine. And Lainie can answer the question about balance sheet.", "Lainie Goldstein", "So in the R&D, the capitalized in the expense, we haven't shared before the breakdowns of new and versus of old IP. But both of our labels work on new and all that new IP and then all franchises all the time, so that's all included in that balance.", "Karl Slatoff", "Dave, I'll say -- its Karl talking. We said this many times before that we have a very strong philosophy around how you can just come out and just re-release franchises over and over and over again. It's very important to us to constantly be investing in new IP. That is the state of the objective of our company. We don't feel comfortable sitting on our accomplishments and not trying to push the bar forward or not only to ban with those franchises but obviously coming up with new franchises as well. You got to keep the pipeline going and that's all we want to do.", "Daniel Ernst \u2013 Hudson Square Research", "Good. That's great, Karl. And if I could just have one other question; if you look at your planned split for domestic versus international 55, 44 a lot of media internet companies is kind of a flip-flop from that. What are the prospects of moving towards having a bigger presence overseas than you do domestically?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah. We've already moved that number meaningfully in the past few years. And remember that includes our sports revenue which does tend to skew for us still towards the U.S. We made a big push internationally by aggressively focusing on Asia, headquarters in Singapore and offices over much of Asia. And we mentioned the progress we've made with NBA 2K online. So that's just one reflection of the progress we've made in the market, but international, we are a worldwide company and international revenue should continue to increase.", "Daniel Ernst \u2013 Hudson Square Research", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee. Please proceed.", "Arvind Bhatia \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Yeah, thank you. I'd like to say congratulations on making up another solid quarter. I was wondering if you might be able to give us some more color on digital that's baked into your fiscal '15 guidance. Should we be thinking in terms of the percentage -- I think about 20% of your fiscal '14 was digital, I think about 18% to 19%. Is that the right way to think about it?", "And then I know you had NBA 2K14 on the next-gen, are you able to tell us what percentage of your game is on that game are full game downloads, what you are hearing maybe from other companies? And then lastly in the fiscal '15's late, the unannounced titles, can you talk to whether -- how dependent that is on AAA titles versus, I don't know AA or more average type titles. Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah, in terms of percentage of revenue attributable to digital distribution, it's a work in progress. There is no doubt in the year when we initially launched Grand Theft Auto V shipping 33 million units, that's the year that's going to skew the physical distribution. So, as revenues are lower as one could imagine digital revenue is being somewhat higher, but that remains to be seen and it depends on our release schedule and how our recurrent consumer spending develops, but I wouldn't want you to extrapolate from this past fiscal year to the subsequent fiscal year.", "In terms of a breakout for NBA, full game downloads versus Virtual Currency, we haven't broken that out. And in terms of unannounced titles, it's tempting to be flippant and say everything we do is going to be a hit. We know that, much as we'd love to say that. That isn't always the case, but it's very much our goal, and we really only work on AAA titles and our teams only work on titles they're passionate about and they only work on titles they believe can and will be massive hits. We're right much more often than we're wrong. And according to Metacritic, we have the highest Metacritic scores for the past six years, including this past year. That's a reflection of both that objective and the execution of the objective.", "That doesn't guarantee that everything we'll do in the coming year will be a hit, but that certainly is our goal. We don't have AA titles. We don't have A titles. We only work on AAA titles.", "Arvind Bhatia \u2013 Sterne Agee", "So it is more than one AAA title that's in the guidance?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes.", "Arvind Bhatia \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Crum from Stifel. Please proceed.", "Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel", "Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I wonder if you could talk about the confidence in the fiscal 2016 positive cash flow guidance that you mentioned, Lainie. And then separately, Strauss, could you talk about maybe it's better asked of the studios, but you got Evolve on new-gen and Borderlands Sequel on past-gen. What's the philosophy behind not making them available on both generations of systems? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Drew, our outlook for fiscal '16 and going forward where we say that we plan to be profitable in the foreseeable future, it's based on a multiyear plan, which gets ongoing profitability for the company, and in '16 it also showed positive cash flow.", "In addition, our development pipeline which extends out further gives us confidence in our ability to remain profitable over the long-term.", "Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel", "Lainie, are there any other working capital items or one-time items that are influencing that guidance?", "Lainie Goldstein", "When we look at '15 we were growing our capitalized software balance to support our exciting pipeline of titles, and then -- and we look at the timing of our new releases, which is why we're modestly going to be down in '15. And then that cash flow should be collected in '16 as well as the profitability ongoing in '16 will affect the overall two-year cash flow.", "Karl Slatoff", "And Drew, it's Karl. In terms of Evolve and Borderlands for next-gen, current-gen -- so for Evolve, this is a title we're obviously extremely excited about. We've gotten a lot of great press about it, there is a great buzz and there will be some more about on E3, and hopefully I'll get a chance to check it out because it really is a fantastic title, and the bottom line is the strategy. That's the next-gen game built on a next-gen engine and it's meant for next-gen. That's truly taking advantage of what the game has to offer, and I think you'll understand more about that as you get to know the game better. I think you'll understand what we mean because it really is something that we think is going to take the cooperative and competitive multi-player to a new level. So, it really fits best on next-gen consoles.", "In terms of Borderlands, really the opportunity there is you've got an enormous install base, and you've got a platform where there is a lot of folks out there they're still hungry for content and there is not a lot of other content coming out, that's exclusively for -- or specifically for current-gen consoles. And we just saw a market opportunity and we think that our title fits very, very well in that regard.", "Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Tim O'Shea - Jefferies", "Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just today all the fiscal '15 titles are coming out of 2K, I'm just wondering the likelihood of seeing a Rockstar title in fiscal '15? I may have missed exactly how much full year revenue Lainie said to expect from Rockstar but I think it was 45%, thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah, we basically said that Rockstar is hard at work on their lineup and there is news to come for this fiscal year, and we expect Rockstar to account for about 45% of the year's revenue.", "Tim O'Shea - Jefferies", "Fair enough, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Mitchell with Brean Capital. Please proceed.", "Yung Kim - Brean Capital", "Hi, this is Yung Kim for Todd. Just quick question in regards to the balance sheet; there were some step ups in both restricted cash and for accrued expenses. Could you walk us through what drove those two?", "Lainie Goldstein", "It's a cash balance of about 194 million. It's for payment of certain software development royalties and those are included in our accrued expenses at the end of the year.", "Yung Kim - Brean Capital", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital. Please proceed.", "Neil Doshi - CRT Capital", "Great, thanks guys. Karl, just another question on Evolve; it's going to face probably some tough competition this fall in the shooter category. How should we think about the opportunity for this franchise? And then, maybe a question for Strauss; Google and Apple are now trying to strike deals with developers for exclusivity. How do you think this impacts the industry and impacts Take-Two's business? Thank you.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Neil. So, in terms of Evolve, you're right there are lots of products coming up this fall, and I think it's going to be a really great year for the entire industry. And in general I think that's a really good thing because a lot of people will be in the stores and they will be talking about games and they'll be buying a lot of games.", "We happen to believe Evolve is so different and unique that the game will stand on its own. And in general we understand that there is the notion of consumer wallet share out there, and people only have a certain amount of money that they're willing to spend on entertainment experiences. But we really don't see ourselves as specifically competitive with any other company or any other game, and with the exception perhaps maybe in the sports business. But in general we don't really fear the competition in that way and we think this game specifically will stand out in a cloud. We actually like the fact that there are lot of games coming out because, again, it gets people on the stores and it gets people buzzing about the industry.", "Strauss Zelnick", "This is Strauss, in terms of Google, Apple and others perhaps seeking developer exclusivity, it remains to be seen. Our stated strategy is to make our products widely available, whatever platforms consumers are using and we're flexible about the nature of the platform, the size of the screen as well as the business model. So, we're not rule-based in that way.", "Generally speaking, we look for wider rather than narrower availability. If for some reason the business evolved differently then we'd evolve with it. I doubt that it's going to become a business of platform exclusive; that would be costly and it's hard to imagine that would really benefit consumers. And the analogy is pay television. In the early days of pay television there was not a lot of exclusive content and exclusive deals, and pretty quickly the pay television services determined that, didn't make a whole lot of sense. So, I'm skeptical with that's how the business will develop, but if it does develop that way we will take the opportunities as we find them.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, I want to thank you first of all for joining us today, and just take another moment to express gratitude to our entire team worldwide, many of whom are on the call today. We had an amazing time of development and growth and success, driven of course first and foremost by the incredible creative efforts of our teams at both Rockstar and 2K. And we are immensely grateful to the folks who show up at work every day and try to think out of the box and do something that's never been done before. And we are equally grateful to our marketing distribution and business teams who make sure that we get the very best out of those products as we market and distribute them around the world, and then as we run this business in a very high-class way. And I think all those efforts are reflected in the results that you see. It's a lot of work every day, but it's the work that we're passionate about, that we love and we very much appreciate all of our shareholders' support and we endeavor to deliver another great year for you.

Thank you, Mr. Diamond, you may begin.", "Henry A. Diamond", "Good afternoon. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 ended June 30, 2014.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.", "Take-Two's fiscal year 2015 is off to a solid start, with the first quarter marking our eighth consecutive period of better-than-expected results. I'm especially pleased to report that we're able to deliver non-GAAP revenue growth without the benefit of any major new releases, driven by our expanding portfolio of digitally delivered offerings, continued growth in our NBA 2K franchise and persistent demand for Grand Theft Auto V.", "NBA 2K14 continues to expand its global audience and has become our first sports release to cross the 7 million unit selling mark. The title has captivated gamers on both current and next-gen platforms, surpassing both FIFA and Madden as the third highest unit selling title of any genre on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the United States. Over the past 5 releases, the NBA 2K franchise has grown at a compounded annual rate of 35%, reflecting the consistent ability of 2K and Visual Concepts to raise the bar for excellence and build the series into one of our company's most important and durable franchises.", "Last September, Grand Theft Auto V delivered the most successful launch in the history of entertainment, achieving $1 billion in retail sales in only 3 days. Nearly a year later, the title continues to attract new audiences in Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with worldwide selling now surpassing 34 million units. Fans can look forward to Rockstar Game's release of the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC versions this fall, which Karl will have more to share about shortly.", "During the first quarter, digitally delivered revenue grew 43% year-over-year, to $106.4 million. Nearly 90% of this growth came from recurrent consumer spending, which accounted for approximately 60% of our digitally delivered revenue during the period. The remainder came from full game downloads across console, PC and mobile platforms. The largest contributor to recurrent consumer spending was virtual currency for Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K14.", "Grand Theft Auto Online continues to outperform our expectations and was once again the single largest contributor to digitally delivered revenue. During the first quarter, Rockstar Games released several updates, including the Capture Creator, highlight pack, I'm Not a Hipster pack and the limited time Independence Day Special, which contributed to players' ongoing strong engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online. We're highly enthusiastic about the future of Grand Theft Auto Online, including its upcoming fall launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC", "Recurrent consumer spending for NBA 2K also continued to grow during the first quarter, with revenues up 150% year-over-year. Online play, including multiplayer gaming, has become an important enhancement to most players' engagement with our industry-leading basketball franchise.", "Downloadable add-on content for our frontline titles is also a key contributor to recurrent consumer spending. During the first quarter, we broadened our offerings with the release of Borderlands 2, Headhunter 5.", "Recurrent consumer spending was also enhanced by our free-to-play online games in Asia. In particular, NBA 2K Online, which we launched in partnership with Tencent in China, continues to deliver growth and revenues and player engagement. Gamers in Asia can also look forward to the commercial launch of Civilization Online, our massively multiplayer online game based on our successful Sid Meier's Civilization franchise, which is being delivered -- being developed by MMO design luminary Jake Song and his team at XLGAMES in Korea.", "Catalog sales accounted for nearly 55% or $82.7 million of our first quarter revenue, led by the Grand Theft Auto series; Borderlands 2, which is now sold in more than 10 million units; Sid Meier's Civilization V which is now sold in over 6 million units; and BioShock Infinite, which is now sold in nearly 7 million units.", "Our company continues to benefit from creating the highest-quality titles that attract new audience as well after their initial launch. For the calendar year-to-date through June, Take-Two was the #1 third-party publisher in the United States in terms of catalog unit sales per SKU across Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3.", "Take-Two had phenomenal success at this year's E3 show in Los Angeles, which featured the first reveal of Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 4 and playable demos from 2K's extraordinary lineup. Our booth attracted thousands of attendees each day, who waited hours to experience 2K's titles, which in total won more than 100 editorial awards and honors. Evolve won more than 50, including the coveted Best of Show Award. We're incredibly proud of this achievement and believe that it bodes well for the title's February lunch, which Karl will discuss shortly. I'd like to congratulate both Rockstar Games and 2K on their stellar performance at E3.", "Fiscal 2015 is poised to be another strong year of revenues and profits for our organization, highlighted by a diverse array of new AAA releases and innovative digitally delivered offerings. With 16 titles we've announced to date, we've disclosed our complete frontline release schedule for the current fiscal year. There are no longer unannounced titles assumed in our guidance. The outlook for our lineup is stronger than ever, which, coupled with our better-than-expected first quarter results and current business trends, enables us to maintain our guidance for the full fiscal year. Our ability to project these strong results illustrates how our company has been transformed into a diversified interactive entertainment enterprise with numerous successful franchises and meaningful profits from recurrent consumer spending.", "Looking beyond the current year, Take-Two has the 4 key attributes that should enable us to maintain our positive momentum: the best creative talent in the business, the strongest portfolio of intellectual property, leading-edge technology and ample cash. We have numerous titles in development, including both groundbreaking new intellectual properties and offerings from our established franchises. As a result, we're well-positioned to deliver non-GAAP profits every year for the foreseeable future and returns for our shareholders over the long term.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Strauss. Today, I'll provide an update on our release schedule for the remainder of fiscal 2015.", "On October 7, Visual Concepts will step onto the court to continue our NBA 2K franchise's resign as the #1 basketball game in our industry. NBA 2K15 promises, once again, to set new benchmarks for sports realism and game play on both current and next-gen consoles and PC. Oklahoma City Thunder superstar, 4-time NBA scoring champion and 2014 NBA Most Valuable Player, Kevin Durant, will make his solo debut as the game's cover athlete and this year's release will include more teams and players from the Turkish Airlines euro league. In addition, internationally renowned music artist and producer Pharrell Williams will curate the most extensive and unique soundtrack compilation in NBA 2K franchise history. 2K and Pharrell will unveil the soundtrack later this summer.", "On October 14, 2K will release Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. For the first time in the series, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel will transport players to Pandora's Moon, where they will experience intense gravity bending gunfights using an array of all-new weapons and loot. Codeveloped by Gearbox Software and 2K Australia, the title takes place in between the stories of the original Borderlands and Borderlands 2 and will continue the franchise\u2019s tradition of innovative, cooperative multiplayer action. The Borderlands universe has become one of our company's most popular series and we're thrilled to provide fans with even more ways to experience its incredible gameplay.", "On October 24, 2K will build on the successful Civilization franchise, which has entertained audience quarter of a century and sold in more than 25 million units worldwide, with the release of Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth for PC. The title will feature the core and tactical elements for which the series is famous, while propelling players beyond the traditional timeline of a Civilization game by exploring humanity's future on an alien world. Beyond Earth generated tremendous buzz at E3, winning more than 18 awards globally, including Best Strategy Game Honors from the E3 game critics, Game Informer, IGN, Destructoid and Game Revolution.", "On October 28, 2K's WWE franchise will make its next-gen debut, with the release of WWE 2K15, which promises to take the series to new heights. 15-time WWE world champion, John Cena, will be the cover athlete; and Sting, one of wrestling\u2019s most beloved competitor will play a key role in the title's preorder campaign.", "This fall, Rockstar Games will launch the blockbuster hit Grand Theft Auto V on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, bringing across-the-board graphical and technical enhancement to the game's already breathtaking open world experience. The current community of players will have the ability to transfer the Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression to their choice of either PlayStation 4, Xbox One or PC. All content and Gameplay created for both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online will also be available for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC, with more to come. Rockstar Games will continue to explore both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online with new offerings throughout the year, including regular content drops and limited time event updates.", "The launch of Evolve, coming from 2K, has been moved to February 10, 2015. When we first acquired Evolve, we believe that Turtle Rock was creating something truly unique, which was poised to redefine the shooting genre. Coming out of E3, our instincts were proven correct and the reaction to Evolve, including its numerous awards, speaks volumes about its potential in the market. We are encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive response from press and fans and believe that extending development by a few months will allow the team enough time to fully realize their creative vision for Evolve, while enabling us to take advantage of a favorable release window. We very much appreciate consumer's anticipation for Evolve and we're confident they will be well rewarded when the game launches in February.", "Our robust development pipeline extends far beyond fiscal 2015. We have numerous titles planned for release during fiscal 2016, such as 2K's Battleborn, an all-new intellectual property developed for next-gen and PC by Gearbox Software, the creative team behind our Borderlands franchise. Battleborn is a highly-stylized blended genre game, which combines frenetic first-person shooting, cooperative combat and an expansive collection of diverse characters to deliver a never-before-played hero shooter experience. The title is featured on the cover of the August issue of Game Informer, which provided an in-depth first look at the game. 2K will have more to share about Battleborn in the coming months.", "Next week, 2K will have a major presence at gamescom, Europe's largest interactive entertainment event, which attracts more than 300,000 attendees, including media and consumers. We will offer playable demos of NBA 2K15, WWE 2K15, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and Evolve, as well as private press and retail showings of Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth.", "Heading into this holiday season, we will fully leverage our worldwide marketing and distribution expertise to create must-have moments at retail and also continue to complement our core titles with innovative, digitally-delivered offerings. Rockstar Games and 2K will roll out campaigns that span all forms of traditional and online media to usher in what we believe is one of our most diverse and strongest lineups ever.", "In closing, I'd like to join Strauss in thanking all of our colleagues around the world for their contributions in delivering a strong start to the year.", "I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll review our results for the fiscal first quarter and then discuss our outlook for the fiscal second quarter and full year 2015. All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP results from continuing operations and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our results for the fiscal first quarter, net revenue increased 5% to $151.6 million. This exceeded our outlook range of $120 million to $135 million, due primarily to the continued strong performance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online.", "Digitally delivered revenue grew 43% to $106.4 million. The largest contributors were the Grand Theft Auto series, the NBA 2K franchise and offerings for Borderlands 2. Approximately 60% was derived from the recurrent consumer spending, including virtual currency, add-on content and online games.", "Catalog sales accounted for $82.7 million in net revenue, led by the Grand Theft Auto series, Borderlands 2, Sid Meier's Civilization V and BioShock Infinite. Gross margin increased 22.7 percentage points to 58.1% due to the absence of a $29 million impairment of capitalized software development costs which was recognized during the first quarter last year. Operating expenses were $95.8 million, up by $2.2 million due to higher personnel expense and depreciation. Interest and other expense was $2.3 million. And non-GAAP net loss narrowed to $11.2 million or $0.14 per share as compared to a loss of $47.1 million or $0.54 per share in fiscal first quarter 2014. This result was better than our projected loss of $0.25 to $0.35 per share.", "On a GAAP basis, we reported revenue of $125.4 million and a loss from continuing operations of $35.4 million or $0.45 per share.", "Turning to some key items from our balance sheet at June 30, 2014, as compared to March 31, 2014. Our cash and short-term investments balance decreased to $841.4 million. Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $43.2 million, primarily reflecting the collection of receivables from our fourth quarter and holiday sale. Inventory decreased to $23.1 million due primarily to continued sales of Grand Theft Auto V. And software development cost and licenses increased to $255.6 million, reflecting the development efforts around our pipeline of upcoming releases.", "Now I will review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2015, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis.", "Starting with the full year, we are reiterating our financial outlook including non-GAAP net revenue of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.80 to $1.05. The majority of our revenue is expected to come from new releases, including NBA 2K15; Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC; Evolve; WWE 2K15; Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel; and Civilization: Beyond Earth; and catalog sales led by the Grand Theft Auto series. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 40% from Rockstar Games and 60% from 2K. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect gross margins in the mid-40s.", "Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 4%, driven primarily by rent for larger studio locations, personnel expense to increase headcount and higher depreciation expense. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 17% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $9 million, tax expense of about $37 million and weighted average fully-diluted shares of approximately $114 million.", "Interest on the convertible notes, net of tax, is approximately $7.4 million, which should be added to net income to calculate net income per share under the if-converted method.", "As a result of working capital needs, we continue to expect our operations to use a modest amount of cash in fiscal 2015. However, we expect to generate cash from operations in fiscal 2016 and to be net cash flow positive over these 2 fiscal years.", "Turning to the second quarter. We expect non-GAAP net revenue to range from $95 million to $110 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to range from $0.60 to $0.70.", "Revenue in the second quarter is expected to be driven by Catalog sales, led by the Grand Theft Auto series, NBA 2K14 and Borderlands 2. We expect second quarter gross margins in the low- to mid- 60s due to a higher mix of digitally delivered revenues in the period.", "Total operating expenses are expected to decrease by approximately 27%, primarily due to lower marketing expense for Grand Theft Auto V as compared to the second quarter last year. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 55% of net revenue based on the mid-point of our outlook range. Our second quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $2 million, a tax benefit of $2 million and weighted average shares of approximately 80 million. Additional details about our financial outlook are in the press release, reporting our first quarter results which was issued shortly before this call.", "In closing, we are pleased that fiscal 2015 is off to a solid start, with better than expected first quarter results. Our industry-leading creative and intellectual property assets, coupled with an ample reserve of cash, provides Take-Two with a strong foundation to continue to execute our proven strategy and deliver positive results, both this year and over the long-term.", "Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work. To our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.", "Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "So want to understand what the impact of moving Evolve from the fall to the February timeframe, it's on revenue guidance. You guys beat your first quarter guidance, but you're reiterating for the full year. So just want to understand what impact that has on how you're thinking about revenue for the year.", "Lainie Goldstein", "We don't give out our guidance on a title-by-title basis. The title did move, but we have a lot of movement in our guidance from this quarter versus when we previously gave out our initial guidance. And we beat Q1, we also adjusted all our estimates for our titles, for our pipeline that's coming out in fiscal '15. And there were some changes to our release schedule, as we mentioned.", "Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And then some of your competitors have seen weakness on new releases on past-gen systems. Just want to get a sense as to what you're anticipating for Borderlands, which will not be available on next-gen systems.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. We've definitely seen others' reports, largely on catalog. And I think our view is that if you give consumers what they want, they come out for it. Our catalog sales have done very well, that's what we announced in this quarter, it's one of the key reasons that we were able to beat in the quarter. And we have a lot of faith in the Borderlands franchise. There's still a huge installed base of consumers. Borderlands is beloved, Borderlands 2 has sold something like 10 million units to date. And so we have very high hopes for the pre-sequel for current gen platforms and, PC, indeed, But. It'll be reliant on quality and every expect to deliver high-quality games.", "Karl Slatoff", "And I think one of the differences that we may have from our competitors is this is a fresh new experience that's build for this current gen system, which has not been the case with our competitors. Particularly the weakness of the competitors have seen is on when you're coming out with both titles on current gen and next-gen and there's not necessarily a distinction between the two.", "Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then one last question and I apologize if I missed this in your remarks, Karl, but is there anything contemplated in the fiscal 2015 guidance with respect to DLC for Grand Theft Auto V?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We don't have anything in there for Grand Theft Auto V. There may be some free downloadable content that's given out there in the year, but anything that brings revenue to top line hasn't been -- we've got nothing announced today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets.", "Thomas F. Andrews - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "This is Tom Andrews standing in for Edward tonight. Just a couple of quick questions. One, can you go into a little bit of detail about the revenue breakdown in terms of what was generated from your 2K portfolio versus what was generated by the Rockstar portfolio? And then just one housekeeping item. Can you go through the individual stock option expense lines for the quarter?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, we wouldn't normally go through that kind of detail on the call. You can follow-up separately with Hank if you wish and Lainie can respond to the 2K versus Rockstar split in the quarter.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Right. For Q1, Rockstar was approximately 45% and 2K was 55%.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.", "Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "When you look at the nice digital revenue you had, plus 43% year-over-year, you mentioned in the release it was driven by GTA, NBA and Borderlands. Could you maybe give us some of the mix there? I know you highlighted GTA virtual currency and NBA, but maybe some color on mix split, including Borderlands. And then Strauss, you've had great success with NBA 2K. You highlighted the 7 million benchmark. How do you think about entering additional sports categories going forward? And obviously you're doing pretty well with WWE right now.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. We appreciate the question. We don't break out how the titles are doing specifically. And I know people would like that kind of color, but we're still in the middle of exploiting these titles and delivering these fantastic experiences to consumers. So it's still a work in progress. However, we are very pleased with how all of it's going. Very, very pleased with the current consumer spending in general. Very pleased with virtual currency sales. Very pleased with Grand Theft Auto Online's metrics across the board and very pleased with how NBA 2K is doing. So it's an excellent story across the board. We don't break it out title by title. In terms of our sports business, thank you for the compliment disguised as a question, happy to have it. And naturally, we're trying to grow the business and we're doing so selectively. What we found is that when we're leader in a space, we do really, really well. We also ran in the space we don't do well. And one of the things we try to do around here is start from the point of delighting audiences and putting out the highest-quality products and then thinking about making money. But equally, we really, really object to losing money. The bulk of what we do around here is owned intellectual property, by definition, a sports business is a license property, so we have to be exceedingly selective in our licenses. And the company's had history around that. So, generally speaking, I think this is a very disciplined, sometimes to a fault, management team and that applies to the sports business. But I don't want that to be confused with the lack of ambition because, indeed, we're very, very ambitious to grow the enterprise.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Zachary Arrick with Senvest.", "Zachary Arrick", "Could you tell us the reason for the delay, the pushback in the release date for Evolve?", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes, absolutely. We primarily decided that the title deserves and should have more time to be polished so it can reach its absolute optimal state before we release it. And historically, we've always benefited from giving the creative teams more time to polish the titles. We've never regretted it. It's not a meaningful amount of time. The title's still coming out in the fiscal year. And we're really excited about the title. Coming out of E3, where we won Best of Show, it felt like the right thing to do, to make absolutely sure this title can be its very best. At the same time, I do believe February's a pretty terrific release window. It's not at all crowded and we will benefit from the fact that there are a lot of holiday sales of consoles, so the installed base will be bigger and it should be pretty open time to release. And if you look at our history over the past 7 years, we're a company that's often released major titles outside of the holiday season. In fact, we typically are not very active in the traditional holiday season. So having such a robust release schedule for October is somewhat unusual for us. We're really excited about it. But I, for one, am glad that we have Evolve coming in February for any number of reasons.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.", "Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Ryan calling in for Justin. Just wanted to go back to GT Online (sic) [GTA Online] real quick. If you could talk about maybe what's the content that's probably coming out in the next quarter or for the rest of the year that we should maybe keep an eye on? And if you could talk about GT Online (sic) [GTA Online] and what that could be as a piece of that 40% of revenue that'll come from Rockstar this year. And then I have one follow-up.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Yes. We're not really able to give much more color on GTA Online. It's not for want of excitement. We have a great deal of excitement. But when we start getting into content and marketing announcements, that's really driven by the label. We have said though and I want to reiterate, that the release of GTA Online has been extraordinarily favorable for consumers and for us. We're immensely grateful to Rockstar for the incredible product that they delivered, the incredible consumer experience. And we remain optimistic about what GTA Online can be both for current gen and next-gen.", "Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. That's fair. And then for Lainie maybe. Can you remind us what you said about the quarterly run rate for the recurring revenue in GT Online (sic) [GTA Online] and whether it's reasonable to expect that, once it comes out on next-gen, if that quarterly run rate should be a step function up or not?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We didn't give out, specifically, for GTA Online. We did say that 60% of the overall digital came from the recurrent consumer spending. And that includes our virtual currency, add-on content and online games.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "So we're not making any projections about the run rate of anything that we've put out before.", "Operator", "Mr. Zelnick, it appears we have no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.", "Strauss H. Zelnick", "Well, thank you so much for joining us. Obviously, we're thrilled to have beaten our projected outlook for something like 8 quarters in a row and to reiterate our financial guidance for the year. We have a lot of great things coming up. And we're grateful to the shareholders for their support. Thanks for joining us today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Our earnings release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Take-Two built on its positive momentum in the third quarter delivering exceptional results that exceeded non-GAAP expectations for the 10th period in a row.", "As a result of our strong earnings at quarter\u2019s end we had nearly $1 billion in cash and short-term investments. This outstanding performance was driven by one of the most diverse holiday lineups in the company\u2019s history led by Grand Theft Auto V for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, NBA 2K15, WWE 2K15, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: Beyond Earth.", "The stellar debut of Grand Theft Auto V on next-gen consoles illustrates why this series is our industries most iconic brand. The title is the highest rated game to-date on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with the near perfect 97 Metacritics score. And is widely considered to be one of the greatest interactive entertainment experiences ever created.", "Grand Theft Auto V already has sold in nearly 10 million units on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, bringing total sell in of the title to more than 45 million units across all consoles. And we continue to see strong demand for Grand Theft Auto V in the current quarter.", "NBA 2K15 enriched our franchises\u2019 legacy as the number one basketball simulation that sets new benchmark for realism with each annual release. The title was the highest rated sport game of 2014 based on average Metacritic score across consoles and PC, and already has sold in approximately 5.5 million units to-date, continuing the franchises\u2019 trend of year-over-year growth. With the NBA season approaching its midpoint, demand for NBA 2K15 remains high, reflecting the games position as the perennial favorite among sports fans.", "The WWE 2K franchise has quickly proven to be highly successful addition to our annual offerings. This year\u2019s launch of WWE 2K15 outperformed our forecast with sell in to-date up more than 40% compared to last year\u2019s release. We believe the substantial opportunity remains to grow our wrestling series meaningfully overtime.", "Finally, the launch of the Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: Beyond Earth added successful new titles to two of our most popular series. We are gratified that consumer remained dedicated to these brands many years after their initial release and our teams are deeply committed to taking these beloved experiences to exciting new heights in the future. Our strategy is to create permanent franchises and it appears we are achieving that goal.", "During the third quarter digitally delivered revenue grew 64% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of our total non-GAAP net revenue. We benefited both from robust digitally delivered sales of our holiday releases and catalog, as well as continued growth in recurrent consumer spending, including virtual currency, add-on content and online games.", "The single largest contributor to recurrent consumer spending was Grand Theft Auto Online, which continued to deliver stronger than expected results. Consumer engagement was enhanced by the games launched on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as Rockstar games released of two updates, The Last Team Standing Update and the holiday theme Festive Surprise. Consumers on all platforms can look forward to the release of more Grand Theft Auto Online content including Heists.", "Recurrent consumer spending has been growing enhancements to the success of NBA 2K series, including NBA 2K15. During the third quarter it increased nearly 90% year-over-year, benefiting from both online play and significant engagement with the MyNBA 2K15 companion app.", "A variety of other offerings also contributed to recurrent consumer spending in the quarter, including downloadable add-on content, WWE Supercard, which has been downloaded nearly 6 million times since its release last August and NBA 2K Online in China, which now has nearly 24 million registered users.", "Creating opportunities for consumers to engage with our titles after their initial purchase is an important high margin growth opportunity and therefore a key strategic focus for our teams. We plan to support virtually all of our new releases with innovative offerings, designed to drive meaningful revenue and profits from recurrent consumer spending.", "From an industry perspective, we are pleased with the performance of the new hardware to-date, which has exceeded our expectations. Consumer demand for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One appears to have been strong throughout the holiday season with a combined installed base of these platforms exceeding 29 million worldwide at the end of December, according to IDG estimates. The ongoing success of next-gen consoles underscored the vibrancy of the core gaming market and represents a significant growth opportunity for Take-Two.", "I\u2019d like to congratulate our teams around the world for delivering a great quarter and successfully launching five outstanding titles during one of the busiest periods for industry. As a result of our better than expected third quarter non-GAAP results, we once again have raised our outlook for fiscal 2015, which is poised to be one of our best years ever.", "Our fourth quarter should provide an exciting close to the fiscal year.

Each of these expansions will enable fans to deepen their engagement with these beloved franchises.", "Next Tuesday, February 10, we\u2019ll mark the launch of Evolve, the only game in history to win Game of Show honors at both E3 and Gamescom in the same year. Last month, 2K launched an Open Beta and the feedback was enthusiastically positive and well received by the press.", "During the five day Beta test, YouTube content creators and Twitch streamers generated an enormous amount of content resulting in over 3.7 million unpaid YouTube viewers and 1.7 million unique viewers on Twitch. In keeping with our focus on driving recurrent consumer spending, Evolve will be supported with a robust array of additional content, including a value-packed season pass that features four new playable Hunters characters available this spring and three exclusive Monster Skins available at launch.", "In addition, 2K recently released the Evolve: Hunters Quest companion app which links directly into the main game for an expanded experience that can be enjoyed on the go. We are encouraged by the games reception among press and consumers and look forward to a strong global launch for Evolve. I\u2019d like to thank Turtle Rock and 2K for their tireless dedication in bringing to market this important new intellectual property for our company.", "On March 24th, Rockstar Games will launch their record shattering hit, Grand Theft Auto V on PC. Purchasers of the title will also have access to the Grand Theft Auto online at launch which will support up to 30 players. We look forward to bringing this even further enhanced version of the Grand Theft Auto V experience to PC gamers next month.", "Also on March 24, 2K will release Borderlands: The Handsome Collection bringing the critically acclaimed series, which is sold in nearly 23 million units worldwide the next-gen consoles for the first time. The Handsome Collection includes Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel along with all of the downloadable content for both titles.", "This represents over $100 of current value on prior-gen consoles, but now with the graphical fidelity of next-gen consoles for $59.99. The title also features the ability for players to transfer or save data across console generations along with four-player split screen callout play, a franchise first. We think the collection will appeal to loyal Borderland fans who want to experience the series on our new system as well as to those joining its universe for the first time.", "In spring 2015, 2K will launch Sid Meier's Starships, a new turn-based adventure driven strategy game, set in the Civilization: Beyond Earth universe. Starships let the players command a fleet as they embark on a series of missions to explore the galaxy, protect planet and their civilizations and build a federation to usher in a new age of peace. The game will be available for PC, Mac and iPad and will be sold only through digital download. Civilization: Beyond Earth fans who purchase Starships will uncover cross connectivity with the two games that will enhance and expand the depth of both experiences.", "During the fourth quarter, 2K also will continue to support its titles with additional downloadable content, including the WWE 2K15, Showcase: Hall of Pain pack and an exciting new path for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, which 2K will unveil in the coming weeks. In fiscal 2016, consumers can look forward to the launch of Battleborn, an all-new intellectual property developed for next-gen and PC by Borderlands creator\u2019s Gearbox Software.", "The title is a blended genre game that combines first-person shooting, cooperative combat and an expansive collection of characters to deliver an all-new hero shooter experience. In addition, consumers can expect new annual releases from our NBA 2K and WWE 2K series, as well as exciting yet to be announced titles from other popular franchises.", "We\u2019ve also continued to invest prudently in online gaming experiences for Asian markets. During fiscal 2016, we expect to launch Civilization online, a mass multiplayer online game being developed in partnership with XLGAMES. The title is planned for initial launch in Korea and we are exploring potential on other Asian territories as well.", "Looking further ahead, we have robust long-term pipeline of titles in development, including groundbreaking new intellectual properties and new releases from our proven franchises. For example, we can confirm that 2K and Gearbox Software will develop an all-new Borderlands game built specifically for next-gen consoles.", "In addition, we have numerous unannounced titles in development, as well as innovative offerings designed to maximize player engagements and drive recurring consumer spending. We\u2019ll have more to announce about our future lineup in coming months.", "I will now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Karl and good afternoon everyone. Today, I'll review our results for the third quarter and then discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015. All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP results and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our results for the third quarter, non-GAAP net revenue increased 24% to $954 million versus $767.7 million from last year\u2019s third quarter. This result exceeded our outlook range of $745 million to $760 million, due primarily to the outstanding launch of Grand Theft Auto V for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as continued strong engagement with Grand Theft Auto online and robust holiday sales of WWE\u2019s 2K15.", "Digitally-delivered revenue grew 64% to $217.2 million, up from a $132.8 million last year. Revenue from recurrent consumer spending, including virtual currency downloadable add-on content and online games, grew 23% and accounted for 36% of digitally-delivered revenue. The largest contributors to digitally-delivered revenues were offerings for the Grand Theft Auto series, NBA 2K15, the Borderlands franchise and Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: Beyond Earth.", "Catalog sales accounted for $103.7 million of net revenue, led by the Grand Theft Auto series and offerings for Borderlands 2. Gross margin increased slightly to 45.7%. Operating expenses were $157.2 million, up by $40.2 million due to higher marketing expense on third quarter releases.", "And non-GAAP net income increased to $211.6 million, or $1.87 per share, up from $210.7 million or $1.70 per share in fiscal third quarter 2014. This result exceeded our outlook range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net revenue of $531.1 million, a net income of $40.1 million or $0.42 per share.", "Turning to some key items on our balance sheet at December 31, 2014, as compared to September 30, 2014, our cash and short-term investments balance increased to $976.6 million. This equates to net cash of approximately $8.57 per share, which includes the potential dilution from our convertible notes. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $435.7 million, reflecting holiday sales.", "Inventory decreased to $24.6 million due primarily to shipments of our third quarter titles. And software development costs and licenses decreased to $294.8 million, reflecting the amortization of capitalized cost for our recent releases.", "Now, I will review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. Starting with the full fiscal year as a result of our better-than-expected non-GAAP third quarter performance, strong current business trends and positive sales outlook for our upcoming releases, we are increasing our outlook for both revenue and net income per share", "We now expect net revenue to range from $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion, up from the prior range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, and net income to range from $1.65 per share to $1.75 per share, up from the prior range of $1.05 to $1.30 per share.", "Turning to the details of our full year outlook, we expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% from 2K and 50% from Rockstar Games. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.", "We expect gross margins in the mid-to-upper 40s. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 11%, driven primarily by personnel expense on a higher headcount, higher professional fees, and higher depreciation expense.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 14% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $10 million, tax expense of about $70 million, and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 114 million.", "This reflects weighted average basic shares of approximately 80 million, 8 million participating shares and 26 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes. Interest on the convertible notes, net of tax, is approximately $6.8 million, which should be added back to net income to calculate net income per share.", "Turning to the fiscal fourth 2014. We expect net revenue to range from $410 million to $460 million and net income to range from $0.15 to $0.25 per share. The majority of our revenues is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, Evolve and NBA 2K15.", "We expect gross margins in the low to mid-40s. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 64% from the prior year's fourth quarter, due primarily to higher marketing expense for upcoming releases and higher research and development expense for titles that have not yet reached technological feasibility.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 15% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range.", "Our fourth quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $2 million, tax expense of $30 million, and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 115 million. This reflects weighted average basic shares of approximately 81 million, 8 million participating shares and 26 million shares representing the potential dilution from our convertible notes.", "Interest on the convertible notes, net of tax, is approximately $1.7 million, which should be added back to net income to calculate net income per share. We expect the operations to be approximately cash flow neutral during the fourth quarter and we continue to expect to generate cash from operations in fiscal 2016.", "As a result of the creative excellence of our development team, we do some extraordinary holiday lineup. Fiscal 2015 is poised to be one of the most successful years in the history of Take-Two.", "Looking ahead, our industry leading creative assets and strong balance sheet provide a solid foundation for our company to continue to deliver long-term growth profits and returns for our shareholders. Thank you.", "Now I will turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to again thank our colleagues for their contributions to our success. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed.", "Eric Handler", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So at the beginning of the year, you guys sound a little bit cautious with what you\u2019re going to do with your cash because you\u2019re at start-up in your cycle and you thought at that time you were going to be using a modest amount of cash. Now that it looks like you are going to be nicely cash flow positive this year, you should be cash flow positive next year. Your unencumbered cash is on $1 billion, obviously a lot more than you really need. Can we talk about some updated thoughts about potential returns of capital to investors? And then secondly, how do we think about GTA Online going forward in terms of content updates on a long-term basis?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes. Thanks for your questions. In terms of use of cash, obviously it\u2019s good to be in the position that we\u2019re in, that\u2019s a reflection of the team\u2019s great work and the results that we\u2019ve had. So now we have, as we said, nearly $1 billion on the balance sheet. We\u2019ve said over and over again that the cash here is used for potentially three purposes, supporting organic growth and the company story has largely been an organic growth story and one of which we are very proud, supporting return of capital for shareholders.", "And we\u2019ve done that in a big way as well, relatively recent times we purchased almost $280 million worth of stock back. And we have the opportunity also to support our growth with inorganic acquisitions.", "We have a very tight honorable, very disciplined folks who are focused on building our core business. And if we were to do any kind of acquisition, it would have to be strategically powerful and accretive.", "And that\u2019s I think the appropriate lens through which to look at any potential inorganic opportunity and that remains unchanged. So this is a -- it\u2019s a high class problem, one that we take seriously, but those options certainly remain -- sort of remain our landscape.", "In terms of GTA Online, the GTA Online continues to exceed our expectations and delight us, and that\u2019s because it delights consumers and we are thrilled with what the team of Rockstar has done and continues to do. There is more content coming. The Heists are coming. I\u2019ll let Rockstar talk more about that, it\u2019s not for this call. But I do think it is for this call just to acknowledge the extraordinary work that the team has done and the results that it\u2019s delivered. This is a living breathing entity that continues to delight consumers day after day, week after week, month after month.", "Eric Handler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "Michael Olson", "Hey, good afternoon. How would you describe the trends for legacy gen software in the December quarter and so far in the March quarter? Specifically, is the decline in legacy gen easing to some degree as we push farther into the next gen cycle? So that's one question.", "And then the second one would be for Sid Meier's Starships, is that included or not included in the March quarter guidance? In other words, by a spring launch, do you mean after March? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff", "Hi, Mike, It\u2019s Karl. In terms of legacy or old gen products, we are still seeing very robust demand for our current gen -- our legacy gen product. We have heard a lot of rumors, not rumors but of anecdotes that people having very difficulty selling through. We are not experiencing that. I think it speaks to the quality of our products.", "That being said, without a doubt, as we go forward and the next generation continues to grow, and we expect it to, and we are excited about it. It\u2019s inevitable that sales of legacy gen are going to decline over time. How quickly that happens, remains to be seen. I can tell you right now, we still see a robust market for legacy gen products and we\u2019ll continue to put them out as far as long as we make -- as it makes sense.", "Can you repeat your question on Starships again? I didn\u2019t quite pick up the whole thing.", "Michael Olson", "Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s basically by -- I think said spring launch in the press release, does that mean in the March quarter or after the March quarter? In other words, is it factored into the March quarter guidance or not?", "Karl Slatoff", "Yeah, we just said spring at this point.", "Michael Olson", "Okay. All right. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed.", "Drew Crum", "Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, every one. Could you comment on your channel inventory given you sold in nearly 10 million units of Grand Theft Auto V for next gen as well as the NBA 2K15 update you provided nearly 5.5 million units sold in to-date? That\u2019s my first question.", "And then a second question for Karl, you mentioned Borderlands with Gearbox, is that a fiscal '16 launch, or is that yet to be determined? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff", "It\u2019s Karl. In terms of the channel inventory, right now I think you specifically asked about GTA and NBA. We were very pleased obviously with our selling and also sell-through. So we don\u2019t see any of those channel inventory issues at all on any of our products. So that\u2019s not a concern of ours. And I think our retailers are very happy with our sell-through in general and again speak to the quality of our titles and the strong season we had over the holidays.", "And in terms of the new Borderlands title, we have not announced the date for that.", "Drew Crum", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Justin Post", "Thank you. Congrats on a good holiday versus expectations. Can you talk about next year you obviously have a really tough holiday comp? Do you need a big blockbuster title in the second half of next year to kind of -- to grow? How are you thinking about that? Or can you make it up with a lot of small titles? And then can you talk a little about digital download percentage of games for the full game? Is that growing for you? And how will that affect your margins over time? Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah, I mean, mathematically, as you said, it\u2019s tough comp. We had a very big holiday lineup, five titles and we\u2019re thrilled that they did so well. So math is math, and this year is penciling out very well.", "And naturally, if you look at it as a comp -- as a comp problem, it\u2019s challenge, but it\u2019s not really how we look at it. We have a desire to bring consumers the best in interactive entertainment.", "We have 10 franchises that each sold more than 5 million units and an individual release 40 multi-million unit franchises and we have labels with 2,000 creative folks who are actively working on a number of projects. So we believe, can and will be the highest quality projects in the business.", "So we don\u2019t tend to measure ourselves based on annual growth, although it would be very nice to deliver that year in year out. We measure ourselves on doing the very best work that we can over the long-term and that\u2019s work out really well for us over the past seven years.", "So you\u2019re right, it is the tough comp. We have a lot of wood to chop. We feel very, very confident and we\u2019re confident enough to say that we expect company to be profitable next year and for the forcible future. We\u2019re certainly talking about some titles already. So we feel great about it.", "But we don\u2019t see our mission as necessarily delivering quarter-over-quarter year-over-year topline and to our bottomline growth. That isn\u2019t the mission. The mission is to delight audiences and then good things, including good economic things will flow from that. In terms of your question about our digital downloads as a percent of revenue, Lainie will take that.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yeah. For the digital business, we do continue to see it growing quarter-over-quarter. It depends on what the mix of the overall business is, but we do see the digital business in general growing. And as we focus more on recurrent consumer spending, we\u2019re seeing higher margins come from that business, so that continues to grow. We expect our digital margin as a whole to continue to grow as well.", "Strauss Zelnick", "But generally speaking, consumers are migrating to digital distribution of entertainment products and we\u2019re part of that.", "Justin Post", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square. Please proceed.", "Daniel Ernst", "Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones, if I might, first, maybe re-ask the digital question. Could you give us a general sense of the mix of your digital revenues of full game downloads, micro-transactions and DLC kind of what\u2019s the rank order bucket or some general size of the mix?", "And then secondly, more broadly, Strauss, used to be one of the takes on Take-Two was you had an over concentration of revenues and profits in one franchise and that being GTA, and we have been arguing and you have been delivering a broadening of that portfolio with things like Borderlands and the re-launch of Red Dead and BioShock and so you have done that. But the problem is GTA has grown much, much faster, it is actually continued to, as you say, delight and surprise and so we still have this problem. Is that just a high quality problem and you don't deal with it or you almost just want to double down on that franchise, tell me how you think about allocating resources to your portfolio? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein", "The digital, so we talked about in this quarter that 23% of the quarter was digital business, 36% of it was for recurrent consumer spending and we don\u2019t breakout this pieces of the recurrent consumer spending, but the majority of it came from the GTA Online was our biggest component. And then the remainder of the digital, the full game downloads is approximately 50% of overall total sales for the quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]", "Strauss Zelnick", "No. Sorry. Sorry, I have a second question to your question Daniel. In terms of the over concentration of Grand Theft Auto as a contributor to our revenues and profits, nearly as you pointed out that\u2019s a high-class problem, to use the phrase for the second time in the call.", "And remember, our goal is to make everyone of our release as big as it can possibly be. That would be everything from Grand Theft Auto to all the other hits that have around here. And the fact that Rockstar keeps making Grand Theft Auto more and more relevant that it attracts more and more consumers.", "The Grand Theft Auto V has sold in approximately 45 million units for legacy and next-gen consoles is nothing short of extraordinary. We have a great story to tell with our other intellectual property tiers as well and they continue to grow.", "So if someone\u2019s looking at the company and saying, you have this massive industry hit and then you have an array of simply huge industry hits, its very difficult for me to see bad news in there as long as we keep delivering more and more successful franchises and every year since \u201907, this company has successfully launched at least one new mega-million unit selling franchise. It\u2019s our goal to keep doing that, can\u2019t guarantee we will always do, but there are goal to keep doing it.", "And if we do that, I think, we are doing our job well and it\u2019s reflected in our revenues and profits, and if we are fortunate enough that Grand Theft Auto can also grow simultaneously that will only be a thing. I can\u2019t find anything bad about it.", "Daniel Ernst", "Okay. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please proceed.", "Ben Schachter", "Hey, guys. Congratulations really on a couple of years of just excellent execution. I know you're not going to announce the specific title on the earnings call? But for holiday 2015, should we expect a significant new title from Rockstar?", "And then literally, when -- by when should we know the holiday lineup, do we wait for the next earnings call or should we expect that before then?", "And Lainie, if you could let us know the FX impact on the quarter and FY15 guidance and finally, just to clarify what you said on the previous question about 50% of total sales digital downloads, I wasn't sure what that was? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah. Ben, we are not going to talk about Rockstar\u2019s upcoming releases in the call and I know everyone like us too, but it just not the way that we tend to do, we like to leave those announcements to our labels. And certainly when we provide our initial guidance for the year, you could expect more color on what the release schedule looks for the company as a whole.", "Lainie Goldstein", "To just clarify on the digital, so what I said was the full game download represent 15% of our overall revenue in the quarter. To be, so, is that clear?", "Ben Schachter", "Yeah. And then the FX impact?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Okay. For the FX impact on the quarter was immaterial and in terms of looking forward with the FX changes, we are pretty much naturally hedged everywhere. So we do have a hedging program to our cover our balance sheet items. But in terms of our overall operations we have a natural hedge that we feel very comfortable with.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.", "Arvind Bhatia", "Thank you. And I\u2019d like to add my congratulations on the fantastic quarter. I wanted to actually just continue on the discussion of digital downloads? We are getting some questions on that? So I think you just clarify that it was 15% of the quarter? I am just wondering, this quarter you had Civilization as well and how that impacted that percentage of PC, obviously tends to be higher mix digitally?", "And maybe if you can talk about GTA V on next-gen specifically, what trends you saw in terms of full game downloads on that one?", "And lastly on GTA Online, you had that for the fourth quarter last year and this year, wondering if you would give us some color on kind of the year-on-year growth? I don\u2019t see growing every quarter, but just kind of where that ended up this year in Q4 -- in December versus last year? Thank you.", "Lainie Goldstein", "So for the full game download, we don\u2019t break that out on a title by title basis. But you are correct. It is the fifth title during the quarter, being a PC title is heavily weighted towards digital and that would drive that full game download percentage higher specifically in this quarter.", "And when we talk about the GTA Online this quarter is essentially been rising each quarter and it has been up from last year. We also introduced it on to the next-gen this quarter. So that also drove more online revenue and virtual currency revenue, as well as updates during this quarter.", "Arvind Bhatia", "Okay. And I know you're not getting specific by title, but could you kind of generally talk about where you see full game downloads going, just on consoles alone, say over the next 12 months?", "Lainie Goldstein", "We continue to see it rise on a quarter-by-quarter basis, so we\u2019ve expected to continue to do so.", "Arvind Bhatia", "Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Thanks guys. Curious around what type of interest or engagement you\u2019ve seen around the new set top boxes like the Kindle Fire. Have you seen anything noticeable regarding platform uptake from say NBA to GTA to most recently Evolve Hunters? And then does it impact digital downloads or purchases via Amazon versus other channels? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff", "So on your first question, you ask if we\u2019ve seen any uptakes. I think that those platforms are still little -- they are early. But we actually think that they might be very interesting for us. And obviously, we\u2019ll support them with titles to the extent they become relevant.", "In terms of specific -- our specific experiences, we are not seeing a huge amount of activity because we don\u2019t have a huge amount out there right now for people to actually engage with. So I don\u2019t -- I'm not really a best person to give you any real color on the market there. I\u2019m sorry the second question?", "Brian Fitzgerald", "It\u2019s just related to those boxes, Karl, and whether or not it drives purchasers to Amazon to purchase their kind of right out of the Kindle Fire?", "Karl Slatoff", "Yeah. I mean, I imagine it does but I really don\u2019t have any real clear perspective to give you there. But it certainly makes intuitive sense that it would.", "Brian Fitzgerald", "Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed.", "Mike Hickey", "Hey, guys. Great quarter. Thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Strauss, I was hopeful you could remind us on how you and maybe your Rockstar team think about the appropriate pacing between mega-franchise titles like GTA and Red Dead and so forth into this sort of cycle? That, I guess, would be the most patient at this point?", "Strauss Zelnick", "I don\u2019t think we think about pacing in a traditional way. We have said that we think big tentpole releases should not be annualized except for sports titles because we think it\u2019s valuable to build anticipation and because it takes some time to make the highest quality products in the business. But apart from that, I wouldn\u2019t say we over think pacing. I think we bring the titles to markets when they are ready to be marketed.", "Mike Hickey", "Okay. Thank you. And then on Evolve I am sort of curious how that title is shaping up into the release obviously as next week and a fair amount of buzz around. I'm curious if there's any sort of -- there's a bit of negative feedback, I guess, in the DLC strategy. I'm wondering if that's had any sort of impact on the game and the launch here?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah. You\u2019re right, Mike. There was some controversy start-up by an online post. And I guess, controversy, generally speaking, is a good thing. People can argue about the business model. I think we\u2019re delivering a fantastic title that\u2019s well versed with consumers who will pay for it. And all signs are extraordinarily positive.", "I never like to claim success before it\u2019s occurred. This looks to be a good news event. I\u2019m going to leave it at that. Hopefully, in our next call, we\u2019ll have great news to report. But certainly the title won Best of Show at both E3 and Gamescom that\u2019s never been done as far as we know in the same year and the buzz is massive. So we\u2019ll wait till consumers tell us what they think. And all our body parts are crossed around here.", "Mike Hickey", "Fair enough. Best of luck guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pham with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi. This is [indiscernible] for Edward Williams. I was curious if you could share what your thoughts are on -- what you are seeing as the overlap between Grand Theft Auto sales on next-gen. There are net -- how many of them are net new buyers versus maybe an overlap on legacy console? Give a little bit on legacy consoles?", "Strauss Zelnick", "It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s difficult to say. I think it\u2019s a mix and it\u2019s very hard for us to determine which it is. We think there are 45 million sold but there are billions of people on the face of the earth. So we got plenty of room.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Great. And then I was wondering, do you see any trends as to how the next-gen players are spending versus the new legacy players. So maybe in the month of December versus last year?", "Strauss Zelnick", "It is early. They are both fully engaged and I wouldn\u2019t say that at this early point, we have a perspective on difference.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then just one final question for Lainie. Lainie, can you just tell me, remind me of the percentage of cash you have offshore?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Sure. It\u2019s approximately 25% of our cash that\u2019s held internationally.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I\u2019m sorry. Can you say that one more time?", "Lainie Goldstein", "25% is held offshore and 75% is domestic.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Perfect. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Stephen Ju", "Hey. Thanks. Hi, guys and congratulations on a well executed quarter. So, Strauss, I wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. I think you just mentioned that the PC version of GTA V will have the online version packaged in there with it. And is this a simultaneous global release that you are planning for the title and a secondary, how will the PC version of GTA online be different from the console version, if at all? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff", "Hi, Stephen. It\u2019s Karl. Yes, the GTA online will be available with the release of PC. I think the last component was one of the differences between the two.", "Stephen Ju", "Yeah.", "Karl Slatoff", "For a PC and the online versions, you can play 30 players at the same time, so that\u2019s a difference. But other than that, there is not really much to say in that regard. And what was the middle question?", "Stephen Ju", "Is this a simultaneous global release that you are planning across all territories?", "Karl Slatoff", "Yes.", "Stephen Ju", "Okay. Thanks", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Haverty with GAMCO. Please proceed.", "Larry Haverty", "Hi. Two quick questions. One, do you folks have any strategy for the convertible? I would just assume it left the balance sheet but that\u2019s essentially your quality? Just going to let it run or can you force it at some point? And I have got a follow-up question?", "Lainie Goldstein", "On $250 million convert matures in 2016, it doesn\u2019t make sense economically right now for us to take it out until that time, but we continue to evaluate options to see if there is an opportunity to make any changes to our capital structure. And when it makes sense, we will do so.", "Larry Haverty", "And second question which is pretty far away from the first. In the last few weeks, Take-Two -- or not Take-Two, Tencent has announced significant more involvement with the NBA. Could you update us on what\u2019s going wrong with your online game and whether this increased involvement with Take-Two or with Tencent and the NBA means that that product perhaps has much more potential than you might have imagined?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We\u2019ve always been optimistic about the opportunity with NBA 2K online in China. We now have 24 million registered users. It continues to generate revenues and profits for us. We are very-very happy about it. In terms of Tencent and the NBA, two very big important organizations, we have relationships with both. And I will let them comment on their own activities. Probably better not for me to do so.", "Larry Haverty", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Zelnick for closing remarks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Just want to thank everyone for joining us today. We are very gratified by the results. Once again, how we do around here is generated first and foremost by 2,000 highly creative people who dedicate their lives to working here under our auspices and partnership with us and we couldn\u2019t be more grateful for their activities. And of course, they are supported by an equally dedicated group of people who market and distribute those products.", "And then people who make sure that the trains run on time right here, including people sitting with me today. We are phenomenally proud of what our team collectively has built here at Take-Two. We are all grateful to have an opportunity to work here and we are happy to be able to deliver these results for ourselves, for our colleagues and for our shareholders.

As a result of the significant cash flow generated by our business, at fiscal yearend, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.", "Grand Theft Auto V has continued to enjoy positive momentum which began with the title's record-breaking launch on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2013. Rockstar Games built on this unprecedented success with the release of the title on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2014, delivering a game that captivated consumers and critics alike with major updates and new features such as the series debut of a first person mode.

Moreover, Rockstar Games continues to drive ongoing consumer engagement and generated meaningful high margin revenues through the vast open world of Grand Theft Auto Online.", "In addition to Grand Theft Auto V, each of our four other holiday releases outperformed the initial expectations. NBA 2K 2015 was the highest rated sports title of 2014 across console and PC based on average Metacritic score. The title has sold in nearly 7 million units to-date and overall revenue is up substantially versus the same period for NBA 2K14, driven by both higher sales and growth in returned consumer spending. WWE 2K15 had sold in approximately 3 million units to-date, up more than 40% versus the same period for WWE 2K14.", "Going forward, we believe there's a long-term opportunity to grow the franchise substantially by further leveraging Visual Concepts development expertise. Rounding out our holiday lineup with Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and Civilization: Beyond Earth. Both of these titles were substantial and profitable contributors to our results and their success demonstrate the enduring popularity of these key 2K franchises.", "In February, 2K and Turtle Rock Studios released our highly anticipated new intellectual property Evolve. The title launched to positive reviews from influential critics such as IGN and Game Informer and has performed above our expectations with sell in to-date of approximately 2.5 million units, nearly 20% of which were digitally delivered.", "Consumers remain highly engaged with Evolve, playing more than 27 million game sessions since March.

During fiscal 2015, non-GAAP digitally delivered revenue increased by 42% to a new record of $660 million or 37% of total non-GAAP net revenue. This growth was driven by full games downloads of our new releases in catalog along with the successful execution of our strategy to drive ongoing engagement with our titles. Recurrent consumer spending increased 45% year-over-year and accounted for nearly half of our non-GAAP digitally delivered revenue or 18% of our total non-GAAP net revenue in fiscal 2015.", "Grand Theft Auto Online generated its highest ever revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter and has both exceeded our expectations and is now (06:52) single largest contributor to recurrent consumer spending in every periods since launch. Sales of the games virtual currency has been supported by Rockstar Games' ongoing release of numerous free content updates, including Heists, which we launched in March.", "Virtual currency for NBA 2K has also been a key driver of growth.

According to IDG estimates, the global installed base of new gen consoles currently exceeds 34 million units and is projected to reach 50 million units by the end of this year and 110 million units by 2019. This robust growth is a wind at our backs and represents a significant long-term opportunity for our business.", "As a result of our strong cash flow, we have ample capital to pursue a variety of investment opportunities. I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization up to 10 million shares. This reflects our confidence in the company's financial outlook and commitment to return additional cash to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases.", "Fiscal 2016 is off to an excellent start and our outlook reflects another year of substantial non-GAAP profits and positive cash flow. We expect to deliver these results with fewer new releases than in fiscal 2015, anchored by proven franchises.

We'll also continue to invest aggressively in our long-term development pipeline, in order to broaden our portfolio and deliver growth and margin expansion in future years.", "Our strong earnings and positive outlook underscore that Take-Two is a very different organization today than in early years of the last console cycle. Our company has been transformed into a global interactive entertainment enterprise with the industry's top creative talent, a diverse portfolio of industry leading franchises and a solid financial foundation. We're better positioned than ever to deliver non-GAAP profits every year for the foreseeable future and returns for our shareholders over the long term.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff - President", "Thanks, Strauss.", "I'd like to begin by congratulating our teams for delivering an incredibly strong year.

At launch, PC gamers were able to access the vast open world of Grand Theft Auto Online, including all its previously released content and the widely lauded titles.", "We are experiencing strong consumer engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online across consoles and the PC, and Rockstar Games plan to continue to support the title with the ongoing release of three additional content. Also in April, 2K brought WWE video gaming to the PC and mobile platforms for the first time ever with the release of WWE 2K15 for PC and WWE 2K for iOS and Android.

Building on its success, we will continue to support Evolve with additional content throughout fiscal 2016 including a new Monster, additional Hunters and an exciting new game mode", "In addition, 2K, Turtle Rock Studios and Electronics Sports League last month announced the Evolve Proving Grounds tournament exclusively on Xbox One. This global contest allows players to compete in qualifying and regional events, culminating with a global finale in Los Angeles during the week of June 15 where the top teams will be vying for $100,000 prize pool.", "I now would like to discuss our pipeline for the remainder of fiscal 2016. Today, 2K announced Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth \u2013 Rising Tide, a thrilling, in-depth expansion pack from series creator Firaxis Games which is scheduled for release this fall.

We welcome you to stop by our booth and see firsthand how we intend to continue to deliver the most innovative, creative and engaging titles in our industry.", "I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Karl. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Today I'll review our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 and then discuss our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2016. All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our fourth quarter results, net revenue grew 83% to $427.7 million. This result was in line with our outlook range of $410 million to $460 million, as the negative impact of moving the launch of Grand Theft Auto V for the PC was offset by stronger than expected revenues from Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, Borderlands: The Handsome Collection and Evolve.", "Digitally delivered revenue grew 66% to $202.5 million, 64% of which was derived from recurrent consumer spending, which increased 47% year-over-year. The largest contributors to digitally delivered revenue were Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and Evolve. Catalog sales accounted for $78.3 million of net revenue, led by the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands series.", "Gross margins increased slightly to 47.8%. Operating expenses were $125 million, up by $36.7 million due to higher marketing expense for our fourth quarter releases and higher research and development expense. Interest and other expense was $1.6 million, tax expense was $23.6 million and non-GAAP net income increased to $54.3 million or $0.49 per share, up from $21.5 million or $0.21 per share in the prior year's fourth quarter. This result exceeded our outlook range of $0.15 to $0.25 per share due primarily to higher than expected digitally delivered revenues and the timing of marketing expense.", "On a GAAP basis, we reported net revenue of $301 million and net loss of $242.8 million or $2.99 per share.", "Turning now to our full year results. Net revenue was $1.67 billion versus $2.4 billion in fiscal 2014, which had benefited from the launch of Grand Theft Auto V on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360. The largest contributors were Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K15, WWE 2K15 and Evolve. Digitally delivered revenue grew 42% to $660 million, 49% of which is derived from recurrent consumer spending which increased 45% year-over-year. The largest contributors to digital sales were Grand Theft Auto and NBK 2K, Borderlands and Sid Meier's Civilization.", "Gross margins increased 6.9 percentage points to 48.4% due primarily to a higher mix of digitally delivered revenues. Operating expenses were $498.2 million, up by $29.7 million due to increased personnel expense on the higher head count, higher research and development expense and increased depreciation expense which partially offset by lower selling and marketing expense.", "Interest and other expense was $9.9 million. Tax expense was $80.3 million and non-GAAP net income was $219.2 million or $1.98 per share as compared to $510.7 million or $4.26 per share in fiscal 2014. On a GAAP basis, the reported of $1.08 billion a net loss of $279.5 million or $3.48 per share.", "Turning to some key items from our balance sheet in March 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014. Our cash and short-term investment balance increased to $1.1 billion. This equates to net cash of approximately $9.18 (19:53) per share, which included the potential dilution from our convertible notes. Our cash receivable balance decreased to $217.9 million, primarily reflecting collection of receivables. Inventory decreased slightly to $20.1 million and software development costs and licenses decreased modestly to $287.7 million.", "Now I'll review our financial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2016 which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. Starting with the fiscal first quarter, we expect net revenue to range from $325 million to $350 million and net income to range from $0.25 to $0.35 per share. The majority of revenue is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K15 and Evolve. We expect gross margins in the upper 40%. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 27% due primarily to higher marketing expense and higher research and development expense.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 14% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. Our first quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense approximately $2 million, tax expense of $11 million and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 114 million. Interest on the convertible notes, net of tax is $1.4 million, which would be added back to net income to calculate net income per share.", "Turning to the details of our full year outlook. We expect net revenue to range from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and net income to range from $0.75 to $1 per share. The majority of revenue is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K16, Battleborn, WWE 2K16, Evolve and the soon to be announced new title from 2K. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 65% from 2K and 35% from Rockstar Games. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 55% United States and 45% international. We expect gross margins in the mid to upper 40s%. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 3% driven primarily by increased personnel expense from the higher head count at our development studios, higher research and development expense and increased depreciation expense.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 17% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $8 million, tax expense of $35 million and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 114 million. Interest on the convertible notes, net of tax is $5.6 million, which would be added back to net income to calculate net income per share.", "We expect our operations to generate cash in fiscal 2016 to be approximately cash flow neutral during the first quarter. Building on the momentum one of Take-Two's best years ever, fiscal 2016 is poised to be another strong period for our company. Our ability to continue to generate meaningful non-GAAP profits have resulted from our consistent delivery of the highest quality interactive entertainment (23:03) with our industry leading creative assets and ample capital, Take-Two is well positioned to deliver growth and margin expansion over the long term.", "Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another exceptional year and enhancing further our long-term potential. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.", "And now what we would like to do is take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey guys. Congratulations on a good year and a good guidance for the coming year. Few questions here. One, your Rockstar pipeline, how should we be thinking about that? Are you focused on trying to get one new release per year? Is it going to be more sporadic? Any color there would help.", "And then if we can drill down a bit into the recurrent revenue. I assume it's mostly coming from the console, but is it 90% console and then PC and mobile are relatively small or is it more evenly distributed between console, mobile and PC?", "And then finally, Lainie, can you just remind us how the revenue recognition works for the key drivers of recurrent on console, is it net or gross on mobiles, is it net or gross and how does the revenue recognition work from NBA in China? I know a lot, but thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Ben, it's Strauss. Thank you very much. And we really appreciate it. In terms of the question about Rockstar, they're hard at work on the pipeline. They make their announcements when they have something coming up. And the results of GTA V I hope speak for themselves.", "I just want to note, there is a difference in the Rockstar of today and the Rockstar a few years ago, because we have this ongoing entity, GTA Online. And that is a living, breathing, ongoing entity that's continuing to deliver revenue and profits for the organization. So that's going on as we speak and that's going on as their pipeline builds through ongoing development.", "We're probably not distinguishing between our expectations for console and PC. I think that was your second question. And Lainie will take you through our revenue recognition policies. I think you specifically called out NBA 2K Online in China?", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. So for NBA 2K Online in China and most of our mobile and digital revenue is all booked on a net basis and our physical products are on a gross basis.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "All right. Thanks. Good afternoon. Couple of questions. You indicated that NBA 2K was up substantially year-over-year. Would you attribute that growth to a larger next-gen console installed based, a growing player base for that game in particular it continues to have strong reviews, the growth of interest in the NBA or some other factors or kind of all the above?", "And then secondly you mentioned on Evolve 20% full game downloads there. Is that what you kind of anticipate you'll see for kind of all your future releases, or is there any reason why that was an anomaly at that high of a percentage? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, it's Strauss, thanks. Look the NBA is \u2013 the answer to your question all of the above. We obviously are seeing robust growth in new gen consoles and the title continues to get better and better and the audience continues to grow. And we hope that will continue. And our virtual currency sales are also meaningfully up year-over-year. So it's initial engagement and ongoing engagement which is reflecting recurrent consumer spending.", "And in terms of what percentage of our revenue is reflected by digital distribution, we really aren't making projections like that but I think what you're seeing here is digitally delivered revenues continue to grow in importance for our company.", "In the past fiscal year, it's about 37% of our non-GAAP income and about half of that was recurrent consumer spending, business line that didn't even exist for us four years ago. So it's pretty much good news across the board. And digitally delivered revenue is indeed higher margin for us. So our gross margins are now knocking on the door of 50% the past fiscal year that's great news indeed.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Please go ahead.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Few questions for you. First, continuing on the NBA questions. I'm just curious over the last couple of years have you seen larger growth or maybe is the percentage of total revenues for international for that title increasing as the NBA continues to grow globally?", "Also in terms of, this is a good question for Lainie, with guidance in terms of phasing \u2013 I don't how much you're willing to provide right now \u2013 but it looks like you're going to have a good first quarter. Second quarter looks a little sparse in terms of new releases and you'd look okay for third and fourth quarters. Is it reasonable to think that second quarter is probably your low point, maybe EPS losses for that quarter and the rest of the quarter seem that they should be profitable?", "And then last with taxes, are you guys a full tax payer now? How do we think about your tax rate overall?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. This is Strauss. We are seeing nice growth in international markets for NBA. And that is something the team at 2K has really focused on and I think you'll continue to see focus on. Lainie?", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "So for guidance with pacing, we're only giving out for Q1 right now. So we're not talking about the rest of the quarters. And for taxes for the full year looking at tax rate of about 27%, which is similar to what we saw last year that can change and vary from quarter to quarter based on discrete items and reserve and also NOL usage. And we are a full tax payer but we do have some NOLs still in the U.S. to use and in foreign. The $70 million in the U.S. and then about $22 million in foreign NOLs.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Drew Crum of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So Strauss I think you mentioned that Grand Theft Auto Online has record quarterly results. What do you attribute that to and what can you do to keep that momentum going as you look ahead? And then as far as fiscal 2016 guidance is concerned what are you contemplating or assuming in terms of digital should it be up, should it be down for the year. Any comments really (30:12) there? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. In terms of GTA Online, I think you're seeing reflection of the next-gen growth and you're also seeing the reflection of Heists content. So I think that's probably what's driving engagement and the focus is on driving consumer delight. The numbers come from that. And I'm sorry, can you clarify your second question?", "Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "What are you assuming as far as digital is concerned. That's been a growth piece for the company the last several quarters. Should it be up in fiscal 2016 or are you willing to comment on that?", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "We expect digitally delivered revenue to grow in fiscal 2016, both in dollars and in percentage of total revenue. The growth will be driven by increased full game download which will offset a modest decline in revenues from recurrent consumer spending. The digitally delivered content for both traditional and emerging platforms represents an important component of our strategy to drive growth and profits. And we expect to see digitally delivered revenue to grow significantly over time.", "Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Okay, perfect. And one last question. Is there any shares repurchase that contemplated in the $0.75 to a $1 guidance you provided?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, there's none.", "Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Two questions. First, GTA has been a phenomenal success, 52 million units. Can you help us at all understand how many people are active online or playing online right now? Any thoughts on the conversion there?", "And the second, pretty big buyback here. I'm just kind of wondering, why you went ahead with that now, was it kind of gaining better visibility on this year or what kind of prompted that decision now? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. We were actually not giving out any metrics on GTA Online in terms of player engagement. Obviously, we have a lot of data but this line of business still remains relatively new for us. So we are not sharing it at this time.", "And in terms of the buyback authorization. And it is indeed only an authorization \u2013 that's a reflection of our cash position, which is better than obviously than our original guidance was.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, guys. A couple more on GTA. I think you said, the digital download percentage was 75%, so I just want to clarify that. And then, with GTA V PC launch at the end of the quarter, I'm curious what type of demand you're seeing extending beyond June, if you will?", "And then in terms of the online engagement, I know you won't talk too much about that, but did the PC launch impact trends positively or negatively anyway there?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, it's not in the quarter obviously, so we've launched GTA for PC in the first quarter of the new fiscal year. In terms of GTA digital, 75%...", "Karl Slatoff - President", "For the PC.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, for the PC. That was PC owned to clarify, did that answer your question?", "Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah, yes. It does. Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "The question is from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.", "Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to understand your guidance a little bit better in the context that last year you provided what in hindsight was very conservative guidance, and I want to congratulate you because that's it's a high-class problem to have. You had several products that provided upside. As you look out to fiscal 2016, your guidance seems similar and last year was GTA V on next-gen, as you look at this year you have Battleborn and you have GTA V on PC that you just launched. Just help us frame the upside potential, if you will, for this year relative to last year?", "And then my second question is on GTA V on PC. The numbers on GTA V, I think you gave last quarter were 45 million, now 52 million is that all primarily the PC version or the console version also continues to sell? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Arvind, in terms of our guidance from last year, when we gave out guidance that is where we thought that was our best estimate at the time when we gave those numbers out. We had a very robust release schedule and everything seemed to blow our expectations which was a fantastic result. And shows in our full year actual. And if you look at GTA V next-gen in our numbers, the install base grew a lot stronger than we thought it was last year and I think that also drove our numbers up as well as digitally delivered offerings and our recurrent consumer spending.", "When we set our year right now, this is our best estimates based on what we know right now. Of course, we're hopeful to see the same types of results but there is no way for us to know that information now which is why we're guiding to the numbers that we feel comfortable are our best estimates for right now and today. So for GTA V PC, in terms of that being the difference in the units, it's driven by the two consoles, next get, current gent as well as PC and that's why you're saying an uptick in the number on GTA V in general.", "Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Doug Creutz of Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Doug L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. When you had originally launched GTA V, I believe that you had said that there was going to be some story-based DLC content shipping eventually and obviously where your past (36:32) game launch. Is that still something that you have planned? And I'm sure you're not going to talk about timing but is there still something that's in the pipeline for you guys, eventually? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, we haven't discussed any story-based downloadable content. We did talk about the Heists and they've been released.", "Doug L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "But I am correct in remembering that you had talked about that around the launch of the game?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We have different recollections.", "Doug L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Thank you for taking my questions. Nice year too. I jumped on a little late drop, I apologize if you've answered this specifically, forgive me. But for your fiscal year guidance here looks pretty strong considering you don't have a Rockstar Game planned. It would seem that historically, we've been sort of condition for one triple A release from Rockstar every fiscal year and of course you have the PC port but that was sort of delayed from IV. So I'm curious how you think about the pacing. I guess your Rockstar Games and if something has changed from previous pace to your expectations? And I have a follow-up.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Mike, actually the question was posted before you joined the call. So I'll answer in the same way, which is, Rockstar is hard at work on the number of upcoming titles. And remember, our world has changed and that we have GTA Online in the marketplace and that's an ongoing activity of Rockstar and it generates a lot of consumer engagement and it also generates revenue and profits on an ongoing basis. So it was a little bit different than it used to be but make no mistake about it. Rockstar is hard at work on a lot of great stuff.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Yeah, no, fair enough. Sorry for asking something that's been asked. I know you haven't provided too much information on GTA Online, but if you would, I'm sort of curious on how you think about online sales to trend through the remainder of the year and I believe you did guide the recurring category lower to your fiscal year.", "And if we should \u2013 I know, you can't give too much visibility, Strauss, I hate asking questions you can't answer. But if we should anticipate the potential of another larger content release, maybe similar to Heists to keep player engagement for your Online business?", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "We have a little \u2013 because GTA Online is unlike anything else, we have little visibility on how long it will continue its trend of growth. Therefore for purposes of this year's outlook, we've assumed no growth in revenues from GTA for fiscal year 2016.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "And are they still engaged in driving additional content for the online piece, Strauss, or is it...", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Mike, we do expect to see additional content and updates for GTA Online.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi, thanks for the extra questions. Strauss, I just want to go back to something you said at the beginning of the call about \u2013 the company being so different than it was at the beginning at the last console cycle. Aside from the obvious success of GTA, can you just talk a bit about what has changed over these years, because you're clearly a much different and a much better company than it was a long time ago. So what do you think is really driving that outside of GTA?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'd probably \u2013 I'd point any number of things. The first is just the diversification of our product line-up. So every year since 2007, the company as a whole has launched at least one new significant intellectual property. And today we have 10 titles that have each sold over 5 million units for individual release. And over 40 titles that have sold 1 million units. So that's pretty amazing and I think really industry leading and of course some of the largest titles in the industry.", "One of the other changes is the significant focus on Asia and international markets of course the growth in our basketball business and our sports business and the emergence in growth of recurrent consumer spending across a number of categories. So not just GTA Online which is obviously very, very meaningful but also NBA 2K, NBA 2K Online in China and the like.", "So the company has been transformed from a geographical point of view, from a product point of view, from a channel point of view, and from the way in which we address the consumer. And let's not leave out the transition of the industry and ourselves to use digitally delivered revenue which has had a knock on effect to the good for our gross margin which is now around 50% in this past fiscal year, which is a very high gross margin indeed.", "So pretty much across the board we've been transformed. Our balance sheet has also been transformed. And we've been building more in (41:44) cash right now. And we account for our converted (41:48) equity, so effectively that's a $1.1 billion in net cash.", "Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, thanks. It's good to see the progress, and good luck this year.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.", "Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. I wondered if you could talk about your development plans for the PlayStation 3 and 360, how many SKUs you think you might have this year, and then just the plan going forward?", "And also the unannounced title from 2K, I think the adjective is soon, should we expect E3 potentially to be that timeframe? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff - President", "Hey, Arvind, it's Karl. In terms of plans for the PS3 and 360, we're currently planning to do NBA and WWE again on those platforms as well. What's the second question?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It was unannounced title for 2K, are we going to learn more in E3?", "Karl Slatoff - President", "Yeah, you'll learn more on when 2K announces it.", "Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, thanks very much. So Strauss, as you think longer term about the continued transformation Take-Two is seeing, you've chosen to engage with the APAC market consumer through distribution partners, you have no choice to do so. But with the Chinese market, but every other market globally it's probably going to be fair game for you guys to establish a direct relationship with the consumer. So where do you stand on direct versus partnership driven at this point? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. It's a great question. Look, the Asia Pacific market is a very significant area of focus for us. We've done meaningful amount of development there. We've launched titles there. We have a title NBA 2K Online which generates monthly revenue and profits for us. It's been a great piece of business for us. And as you correctly pointed out, we worked with strong partners for much of the region now. We are a publisher in Japan although we have distribution partners there as well.", "And I think in the past, what you saw was a real allergy to any kind of financial risks. So we entered the region focused on how we could mitigate business risks and financial risk. And I think now we feel a little bit more confident about financial risks because we have a good deal of experience with free to play games and massive multiplier games and a good deal of experience in the region. In fact, I just got back from the trip to the region a little over a week ago with some of my colleagues here, which is relatively a common occurrence for me.", "So we're feeling better about how we operate there and as you know we're a team that knows what we don't know, when we like to learn things and we're very disciplined as we enter new markets and new lines of business. So in terms of what that means going forward, it varies market by market.", "I think in the Chinese market, it's pretty likely that we and our competitors are going to have strong local partners, because the media business is an area of meaningful focus for the Chinese government and they really want us to work with strong local partners. I don't really see that changing but it doesn't interfere with our activities. In fact, to the contrary I think it promotes our activities. And Tencent and others have proven to be exceedingly strong partners for us. So I think we're lucky in that way.", "In some other parts of the region, we absolutely (45:22) ability and if it would make sense to go direct, so that is the possibility but we really don't mind sharing. We're focused on getting the very best possible result. And we're focused on delivering the highest quality of content to consumers and in certain instances, that means it behooves us to work with strong local developers and/or distributors.", "Arvind Bhatia - CRT Capital Group LLC", "Thanks, Strauss, and congrats.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this point, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much for joining us today.", "We're obviously really proud of the results that we as a company generated in the last fiscal year. I just want to take a minute to thank our creative teams and our creative teams who generate these results, but they do so, by following their passions and we try to create an enterprise that makes it not only safe for them to do so but gives them all the resources they need to follow their passion. That's all we think about every day. And the goal of this enterprise is to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient. And this past fiscal year I think reflects the fact that we got closer to that goal than ever before. And we're proud about. We aim do to even better going forward. So thanks for joining us. We really appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Hank Diamond. Thank you, sir. You may begin.", "Henry A. Diamond - SVP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications", "Good afternoon. Welcome and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 ended June 30, 2015.", "Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us.

Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.", "I'm pleased to report that during the first quarter we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth, driven by robust demand for our recent releases in catalog as well as better than forecasted recurrent consumer spending. Our solid earnings converted into significant cash flow and at quarter-end, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.", "Nearly two years after its record-shattering launch, Grand Theft Auto V continues to outperform expectations. On April 14, Rockstar Games brought this groundbreaking title to PC with a number of enhancements, generating stellar reviews and strong digitally delivered sales. In addition, we benefited from ongoing demand for the console versions of Grand Theft Auto V, particularly as the installed bases of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One expand.", "To-date, Grand Theft Auto V has sold in more than 54 million units worldwide. And Rockstar Games is successfully driving engagement with the title and meaningful incremental profits through their release of new content for Grand Theft Auto Online, which I'll discuss shortly.", "NBA 2K15 continues to broaden its global audience and build on the franchise's trend of annual growth. Sell-in of the title has crossed the 7 million unit mark and surpassed NBA 2K14 during the same period after launch. And NBA 2K15 has generated substantial revenue growth over last year's release, driven in part by high-margin recurrent consumer spending. Our first quarter results were also enhanced by a diverse array of other recent releases and catalog titles. Standouts include the Borderlands series, particularly The Handsome Collection, WWE 2K15 and Evolve.", "We continue to capitalize on our industry's transition towards digital distribution. During the first quarter our digitally delivered revenue increased 139% to $254 million and represented 69% of our total net revenue. This result was driven by growth in full game downloads and recurrent consumer spending, both of which exceeded our outlook. Recurrent consumer spending represented a significant component of our overall business mix, accounting for 25% of our total net revenue in the first quarter.", "Grand Theft Auto Online was once again the single largest contributor, as Rockstar Games has driven sustained engagement through the ongoing release of free content updates, most recently The Ill-Gotten Gains updates Part One and Part Two, which were launched in June and July respectively. Roughly 70% of Internet-connected Grand Theft Auto V users have played Grand Theft Auto Online. And the active user base continues to grow with average monthly active users for calendar 2015 to-date up more than 40% versus calendar 2014.", "In addition virtual currency for NBA 2K was an important part of our digitally delivered success. Revenues grew by 54% year over year, benefiting both from online console play and strong engagement with the MyNBA2K15 companion app. Downloadable add-on content is also a key element of recurrent consumer spending. The leading contributors in the first quarter were offerings for the Borderlands series and Evolve.", "Finally, our results benefited from the enduring popularity of WWE SuperCard, which has been downloaded more than 7.5 million times, and sustained growth from NBA 2K Online in China, which now has 27 million registered users and continues to be the number one PC online sports title in China.", "Expanding our revenue from our current consumer spending is a key strategic focus for our organization and an important high margin growth opportunity. We now anticipate that revenue from our current consumer spending will grow in fiscal 2016 and represent an increased percentage of our total business mix versus last year.", "Fiscal 2016 is off to a solid start and promises to be another year of substantial non-GAAP earnings and positive cash flow for Take-Two. Our ability to project significant profits this year with a lighter release schedule reflect that our company is now structurally a higher-margin enterprise than at any time in our history.", "Today Take-Two is a global interactive entertainment leader with the industry's top creative talent, a diverse portfolio of critically acclaimed and commercially successful franchises and a solid financial foundation. We're better positioned than ever to deliver growth and margin expansion in future years and returns for our shareholders over the long term.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff - President", "Thanks, Strauss. Today I'll discuss our pipeline for the remainder of fiscal 2016 and beyond.", "On September 29 2K will continue their illustrious basketball legacy with the launch of NBA 2K16.

Stone Cold Steve Austin, a 2009 WWE Hall of Fame inductee and winner of 21 championships throughout his career, will be the cover superstar.", "In addition 2K recently announced that action-movie icon and WWE Hall of Fame inductee Arnold Schwarzenegger, will make his series debut in WWE 2K16. Consumers who pre-order the title at participating retailers will receive his two famous characters from the films The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day to compete in the squared circle against the games roster of WWE Superstars.", "In November, 2K will launch XCOM 2, the sequel to the 2012 Game of the Year award-winning strategy title, XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Developed by Firaxis Games, XCOM 2 will introduce procedurally generated maps for deep replay-ability and will offer higher level of modding support. XCOM 2 will include a diverse collection of new enemies, aliens and weapons and will provide greater story, strategy and technically driven combat. This month, the title will be on the cover of PC Gamer Magazine, which features an all-new detailed look at the game and interviews with the development team.", "Also in development for Access Games is Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth \u2013 Rising Tide, a thrilling in-depth expansion pack from the hit franchise that has sold-in over 31 million units worldwide.

Firaxicon will provide consumers with an opportunity to meet members of the development team, attend panel discussions and experience both Rising Tide and XCOM 2 prior to their releases.", "On February 9, the release of Battleborn promises to continue our proven track record of launching successful new intellectual properties. Currently in development by Borderlands creators, Gearbox Software, Battleborn is a first-person shooter with 25 unique characters that grow and level up as players progress through the game. Battleborn will include a cooperative story mode featuring a variety of heroic adventures, as well as three different competitive multiplayer modes full of intense, online team-based action. 2K will hold an open beta for Battleborn prior to its release and we'll have more to share about its details later this year.", "Also during fiscal 2016, consumers in Asia will experience Civilization Online, our free-to-play mass multiplayer online game developed in partnership with renowned South Korean based studio, XLGAMES. 2K recently completed its second close beta test for the title and consumer response was extremely positive. We believe this bodes well for the game's forthcoming commercial launch in Korea, which represents another important milestone in building our online business in Asia. We also plan to bring Civilization Online to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau through a publishing partnership with Game First and recently announced a deal to launch the title in China, the world's largest PC online game market through online publishing powerhouse Qihoo 360.", "In keeping with our focus on promoting ongoing engagement, we plan to support virtually all of our upcoming titles with innovative offerings designed to drive recurrent consumer spending. We'll also continue to release offerings for many of our current titles, including additional free content for Grand Theft Auto Online.", "Over the past several months, 2K has presented impressive exhibitions at a number of high-profile events that have enabled consumers, influencers (11:41) and press to get hands-on time with our upcoming releases. From E3 in Los Angeles to Comic-Con in San Diego and Gamescom in Germany, the reaction to our titles has been incredibly positive and anticipation for our launches continues to grow. In the months ahead, we'll build on that momentum to reinforce our strong outlook for this year.", "Heading into and throughout this holiday season, we will deploy our worldwide marketing and distribution expertise to drive sales and create must-have moments at retail. Our teams will execute well-coordinated global campaigns that leverage every relevant form of media, both traditional and social to turn our product launches into tent-pole events. Whether on disc or through digital download, we will ensure that our products are available to consumers whenever and wherever they want them.", "Looking ahead, our robust development pipeline extends far beyond fiscal year 2016. Last week, 2K announced that Mafia III, the next installment in our successful organized crime franchise is currently in development for Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC at Hangar 13, 2K's new development studio. Planned for release during fiscal year 2017, the story of Mafia III introduces a new playable protagonist, Lincoln Clay, an African-American Vietnam war veteran who is determined to take revenge on an Italian mob for betraying and murdering his black-mafia family. Players will choose their path to revenge and build their own crime empire in a fictionalized New Orleans, circa 1968. Mafia III combines the best of cinematic storytelling with a dynamic narrative structure that responds to player choice, situated in a city that changes based on their actions.", "In addition, we have numerous unannounced games in development that are planned for release in future years, including both groundbreaking new intellectual properties and offerings from our established franchises. With our industry-leading creative assets and focus on operational excellence, Take-Two is well positioned for the long-term success.", "I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Now I'll review our results for the fiscal first quarter and then discuss our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2016. All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements.", "Starting with our results for the fiscal first quarter, our revenue grew 142% to $366.4 million. This result exceeded our outlook range of $325 million to $350 million due to stronger than expected revenues from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, as well as upside from a number of other titles, especially Borderlands: The Handsome Collection, WWE SuperCard and NBA 2K15.", "Digitally delivered revenue grew 139% to $254 million, 36% of which was derived from recurrent consumer spending, which increased 47% year-over-year. The largest contributors to digitally delivered revenue were Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and Borderlands. Catalog sales accounted for $67.5 million of net revenue, led by Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands.", "Gross margin decreased to 46%, as last year's first quarter product mix was more weighted towards higher-margin titles. And in this year's first quarter we accelerated the amortization of certain capitalized development costs.", "Operating expenses were $119.7 million, up by $23.9 million due to higher marketing and research development expense. Interest and other expense was $1.8 million. Tax expense was $12.6 million.", "And non-GAAP net income increased to $34.2 million or $0.31 per share, up from a net loss of $11.2 million or $0.14 per share in the prior year's first quarter. This result was within our outlook range of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. On a GAAP basis we reported net revenue of $275.3 million and net loss of $67 million or $0.81 per share.", "Turning to some key items from our balance sheet at June 30, 2015, as compared to March 31, 2015. Our cash and short-term investment balance increased to approximately $1.2 billion. This equates to net cash of $10.41 per share, which includes the potential dilution from our convertible notes. Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $129.9 million, primarily reflecting the collection of receivables. Inventory decreased to $12.5 million due primarily to continued sales of Grand Theft Auto V. And software development costs and licenses increased to $310.4 million, reflecting the development efforts around our pipeline of upcoming releases.", "Now I will review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2016, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. Starting with the second quarter we expect net revenue to range from $275 million to $325 million and net income per share to range from $0.05 to $0.15. Revenue in the second quarter is expected to be driven primarily by NBA 2K16 along with Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. We expect second quarter gross margins in the upper 40s%.", "Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 17% due primarily to higher research and development and marketing expense. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 18% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. Our second quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $2 million, an effective tax rate of 27% and weighted average shares of approximately 115 million. Interest on the convertible notes net of tax is $1.4 million, which would be added back to net income to calculate net income per share.", "Turning to the full year, we are reiterating our financial outlook, including net revenue of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and net income per share of $0.75 to $1. The majority of revenue is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K, WWE 2K, Battleborn, the Borderlands series and XCOM 2. We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 60% 2K and 40% Rockstar Games. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 55% United States and 45% international.", "We expect gross margins in the upper 40s%. Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 4%, driven by increased personnel expense from higher head count at our development studios, higher research and development expense and increased depreciation expense. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 17% of net revenue, based on the midpoint of our outlook range. And we project interest and other expense of approximately $7 million, an effective tax rate of 27% and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 115 million.", "Interest on the convertible notes net of tax is $5.5 million, which would be added back to net income to calculate net income per share. We expect our operations to be approximately cash flow neutral during the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2016, and to use cash during the second quarter.", "With fiscal 2016 off to a good start, we remain on pace to deliver another solid year, highlighted by significant non-GAAP earnings and positive cash flow. Through the execution of our proven strategy to deliver the highest quality interactive entertainment experiences, coupled with a sound financial discipline, Take-Two's long-term outlook is the strongest in our company's history.", "Thank you. Now I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie.", "On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and a solid start to the year. And to our shareholders, I'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions.", "Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please go ahead with your question.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at your income statement, it looks like the internal royalties have been paid, and are being paid in arrears as you see the profitability of the Rockstar Studio, I'm assuming. And I'm just curious now that we're seeing, we're beyond the GTA V release with PC, should internal royalties start coming down? I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should be modeling that line item.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Eric, are you looking at the GAAP financials or the non-GAAP financials?", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Well, you only give GAAP for internal royalties. I don't know if you have a non-GAAP for internal royalties.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "We probably \u2013 we don't show that. But the GAAP, the way the internal royalties is calculated is a little different than what we're doing with the non-GAAP where the non-GAAP financials and the EPS associated with that is going to follow along with the overall profitability of the business. And the internal royalties will be calculated based on the overall profitability of the business and that profit share at that point in time.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, guys. When considering GTA, NBA, Borderlands, WWE and Evolve, across those games, can you give us any more color on how they vary in terms of leverage to digital download versus digital recurrent consumer spend? I know you highlighted GTA, NBA and Borderlands specifically in this quarter drove a lot of the recurrent spend. Are there any variances to call out in terms of which franchises are more leveraged to digital download versus recurrent digital spend? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff - President", "Hi, Brian. It's Karl. Obviously, all of those titles are significant contributors to our digital sales, both our digital downloads and in recurrent consumer spending. We don't have any details to provide you specifically across game-to-game, but we can tell you in general, it's growing across all of our franchises.", "Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC", "Great. Thanks, Karl.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey, guys, a few questions. One, Lainie, you said that you accelerated some capitalized expenses in the quarter. Can you talk about how much and why? And then, Strauss, couple of things, M&A environment, anything notably different or changing now versus, say, the last couple of years? And then anything you can add on the cash and what we can expect going forward for uses of cash and potentially returns to shareholders? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "So for the accelerated amortization of the capitalized development expenses that we talked about, the amount is about half of what the margin effect was in the quarter. So we're not talking about what specific title that is for, but that's the amount. And what's driving that is on each quarter, we'll look at the estimates of lifetime titles of our sales, and it will adjust the capitalized development cost, the amortization for it based on what those estimates are, whether it's up or down.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And Ben, regarding the M&A environment, I think, we see that as unchanged. As you know, market prices are robust for certain companies in our space, and I think that reflects the fact that this is a growth area in the entertainment business and certain companies are doing very well indeed. We tend to be very disciplined. We're looking for accretive opportunities and we're very focused on value, but we don't really see any changes there.", "From our point of view in terms of cash, we increased our cash balance this quarter, because operations generated free cash flow. That's certainly good news. We're reporting roughly $1.2 billion in cash. We account for our converts as though they'll be satisfied with equity. So on that basis effectively it's all net cash as well. So our view on that is that cash in our business can be a strategic asset. It allows one to be opportunistic and it supports a company that operates within a business that does offer some risk. So we do see it as a strategic asset that will allow us to avail ourselves of both internal and external growth opportunities as they come about.", "In terms of use of cash we've said there will be three potential uses, first, to support organic growth. This company's story is an organic growth story largely. Second, to avail ourselves of inorganic opportunities. I just addressed that. And third, to return capital judiciously to shareholders. And we do have an open authorization for a buyback from our board. So I think it'll fall within those three buckets. But this is obviously a high-class problem to have.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hey. Good afternoon. So you've had a lot of success with recurrent consumer spending in your major titles. Are you kind of now going into development of every game with a focus on finding ways to drive recurrent consumer spending? I guess somebody already asked about specific titles that may be higher in recurrent consumer spending, but what about genres? Are there certain genres that are better suited for recurrent spend? Or do you think the opportunity is similar across all genres?", "Karl Slatoff - President", "Hi, Mike. It's Karl. I think first and foremost the intention of all the labels in our studios is to create product that people really want to enjoy and that will delight consumers. So that's first and foremost. Whenever we're thinking about development pipeline, it's how can we create franchises. The best way to create a franchise is to create great product.", "That being said I would say pretty much across the board, every one of our releases on a go-forward basis should have some kind of recurrent consumer spending opportunity. There may be some titles where it doesn't make sense. But again that's a creative decision as much as it is a business decision. But there is no \u2013 I don't think there are any specific genres where it doesn't play well.", "If you look at some of the titles today that we're \u2013 from which we're generating recurrent consumer spending, they couldn't be more diverse. So I think it's fair to say that that's a focus for us across all of our titles. And I don't think that there's any set rules in terms of genres, et cetera.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.", "Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Karl, maybe you can talk about the decision to put Battleborn in the February release window. Why not tuck it in in front of the holiday? And then separately any update you guys can provide in terms of DLC for Grand Theft Auto V? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff - President", "Hey, Drew. In terms of Battleborn again whenever we pick a release window for any of our titles, it's two specific things. It's when the title is ready, when is the best time for us to optimize it from a creative perspective, and then when do we think the right window is for that title, given what's in the market and also given the natural consumer patterns of \u2013 purchasing patterns over the years?", "I would say that it's really more the former. The most important decision that we make is, is the title ready? Is it the best creative \u2013 are we putting our best creative foot forward when we're releasing a title? That's always primary.", "And then we'll look at it and we'll say is there an open window? Given that, is there an open window that we can utilize? And I think pretty much across the board there aren't many months in the year where we feel uncomfortable releasing a title. Most of our titles stand amongst themselves. We don't necessarily need a holiday to drive our spending, because these are very high quality, AAA titles that are tent-pole releases in and of themselves.", "And then in terms of DLC for GTA V, we really don't have anything to say about that today.", "Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.", "Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen and Company", "Thanks. A relatively simple question. You mentioned that GTA Online I think is the largest sports PC online title in China. I just wondered if that's based on users or monetization or both?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That's NBA 2K Online in China, and it's based on 27 million users.", "Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen and Company", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.", "Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Thanks, guys. With the digital now becoming a significant portion of your business, any reason not to think why gross margins can't over time get into the 50% or 60% or 70% range, and then any thoughts on digital downloads? I think last quarter you were at 20% for full game download. How should we think about that kind of as we progress into the second quarter and the second half of the fiscal year as you have more console games to be released? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, on your first question on the digital business, we do expect the margins to continue to grow as we continue to get our digital business getting bigger and bigger, but what percentage that's going to be, it's a little early to say, but we expect it to continue to grow over the long term.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And in terms of the percentage of our business reflected by digital downloads as opposed to physical sales, we do see that growing over time. The first quarter was disproportionately high because of the release of Grand Theft Auto V for PC, which tends to be a heavily downloaded format, but we also see the percentage growing for consoles over time. I don't think we're quoting a specific figure.", "Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Curious on Mafia III; it looks like it's had a pretty strong reveal at Gamescom last week. And I'm certainly not, but others are sort of making comparison to, sort of, a Rockstar Open World experience. And obviously, Mafia is a franchise, but curious if the development of Mafia III has been able to leverage some of the tech or expertise from your Rockstar team? Maybe less specifically, if you can't answer that question, have you been able to drive a sharing environment across your development studios? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're blessed that we have two distinct labels at this company and multiplicity of studios with a lot of talent. We do not have a tech sharing environment. A very congenial company, but we don't think that's the best way to get the best out of our development folks. It's not the way it works around here. Mafia III is a completely different experience. I wouldn't compare it to anything else out there. The reveal was great, but it stands alone. And no, we don't use any other game in the same sentence as Grand Theft Auto. It is the industry's standard bearer. It's not up for comparison. So, no, I think, it's flattering to even think that may be the case, but it's not.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Fair enough. The last question from me, just curious on \u2013 it looks like for the quarter, obviously, digital spend was better, reoccurring spend was better, at least versus your expectations. Now it seems you're more optimistic on recurrent digital spend in 2016, now looking for growth and a large percentage of that bucket to your total sales. So why wouldn't that drive upside to your original 2015 \u2013 or excuse me, fiscal 2016 profitability range? I guess basically just curious of the offset. Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's early in the year. We're very happy with the way the first quarter penciled out. We have a lot of other cards to turn over. We've got obviously a big release in the second quarter with NBA 2K16. We're really excited about that, but it is early days yet. But thanks. It's a really good start and we continue to believe we have a lot of work to do. We also have a great deal of opportunity.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Thanks, Strauss. Good luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We'd like to thank everyone who attended the call today for their attention, for their great questions, and we do appreciate your continued support.

Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.", "I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter, we delivered better than expected revenue and earnings growth. Our results were led by the blockbuster launch of NBA 2K16, continued robust demand for Grand Theft Auto V, and strong growth in recurrent consumer spending. The launch of NBA 2K16 was the most successful in the history of the series with over 4 million units sold in during its first week, including strong digitally delivered sales that approximately doubled year-over-year.", "According to the NPD Group, adjusting for days in market, NBA 2K16 had the best launch month of any sports game during this new console cycle. The title also has been a hit with critics and is the highest rated sports game of 2015 on Xbox One according to Metacritic. Virtual currency for the NBA 2K brand continues to exceed our expectations and has been a significant contributor to revenue growth.", "During the second quarter, recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K grew by nearly 120% year-over-year, benefiting both from online play and the MyNBA2K companion app. With the holiday season approaching, demand for NBA 2K16 remains strong and consumer engagement has been outstanding with more than triple the number of games played online versus last year's release. I'd like to congratulate the teams at 2K and Visual Concepts for once again surpassing our high standards for excellence and delivering a stellar addition to our industry-leading basketball series.", "More than two years after their initial launch, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online continue to exceed our expectations, particularly as the installed base of new gen consoles expands. During the second quarter, Grand Theft Auto Online was once again the single largest contributor to recurrent consumer spending.", "Rockstar Games continues to support this vast online world with a rich array of new content. Most recently, the release of Ill-Gotten Gains Part Two, Freemode Events, Lowriders and the Halloween Surprise. This ongoing release of new content has been a key driver of players strong engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online and it's significantly enhanced recurrent consumer spending. Grand Theft Auto Online now has over eight million active users per week, which is more than it had at the same time last year. These results underscore the continued strength and vibrancy of this unique and groundbreaking entertainment experience.", "A variety of other titles from our diverse portfolio also contributed to our second quarter results led by NBA 2K15 and offerings from the Borderlands and WWE 2K series. During the second quarter, digitally delivered revenue grew 57% to $141 million, driven by better than expected growth in both full game downloads and recurrent consumer spending.", "Recurrent consumer spending grew 39% year-over-year and accounted for 20% of our net revenue in the second quarter. In addition to virtual currency for Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings. These included downloadable add-on content, particularly for the Borderlands series, Evolve and WWE 2K15, WWE SuperCard, which was updated with new content, and NBA 2K Online, which remains the number one PC online sports title in China and continues to generate profits every month.", "Digitally delivered revenue, especially recurrent consumer spending remains a high-margin growth opportunity and a key strategic focus for our organization. We expect digitally delivered revenue to grow in fiscal 2016, driven both by higher full game downloads and recurrent consumer spending.", "As a result of our outperformance in the second quarter, we're increasing our financial outlook for the full fiscal year. Our holiday season already is off to a great start and we anticipate a strong back half to fiscal 2016.", "Today, Take-Two's long term potential to generate revenue growth, margin expansion and returns for our shareholders is greater than ever. Our company's strength reflects our unparalleled creative assets, sound financial foundation and unwavering commitment to delivering the highest quality interactive entertainment experiences.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff - President", "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by congratulating 2K and Visual Concepts for their record breaking launch of NBA 2K16, which once again raised the bar for our annual basketball series. In addition to delivering an even more true to life NBA experience, the team has done an exceptional job keeping consumers highly engaged with the title after their initial purchase.", "I'll now discuss our recent releases and pipeline for the remainder of fiscal 2016. On October 8th, 2K and Cat Daddy Games extended our portfolio of action packed mobile entertainment experiences with the release of NHL SuperCard. This collectible card battle game challenges players to build teams of current and legendary NHL players, train them and test their skills in exhibition, season and rivals-based action.", "On October 9th, 2K and Firaxis Games launched Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth \u2013 Rising Tide, a massive expansion pack for the Sci-Fi title from our award winning Civilization series, which has captivated fans for nearly a quarter of a century.", "Rising Tide has earned rave reviews from top critics including a 9 out of 10 from both Game Informer and GameSpot. The pack enriches the Beyond Earth experience by offering a robust array of expansion content with even more strategic ways to shape humanity's future on an alien planet.", "On October 27th, 2K released WWE 2K16, the latest installment in our popular sports entertainment series. The title enjoyed a successful launch, including significantly higher review scores versus last year's release. For example, IGN scored WWE 2K16 an 8.8 out of 10, stating that the title is as close to a fusion of performance and competition as a wrestling game has ever gotten. WWE 2K16's strong reviews are among the best ever received by the series and reflects (8:37) and Visual Concepts' ongoing commitment to improve its quality with each annual release. In keeping with our focus on driving recurrent consumer spending, WWE 2K16 is being supported with a robust array of downloadable add-on content and we are already seeing strong attach rates for its Season Pass.", "We've had an excellent start to the holiday season and our marketing campaigns are in full swing. Whether at physical or online retailers, we will have a significant presence at all key points of purchase. We believe that interactive entertainment will be a must-have category during this holiday season, and we expect the installed base of new-gen consoles to continue to grow. With our industry-leading portfolio of offerings, Take-Two is well positioned to capitalize on these positive trends.", "Looking ahead to our fourth quarter, on February 5, 2K will launch XCOM 2 for PC, the sequel to the 2012 game of the year award winning strategy title XCOM Enemy Unknown. Developed by Firaxis Games, XCOM 2 will feature deep re-playability and offer a high level of modding support. Last month, the title was featured at the second annual Firaxicon event in Baltimore where the development team hosted panels and unveiled more of the game's aliens and enemies. Consumers who pre-purchase or pre-order XCOM 2 will receive the Resistance Warrior Pack that provides increased solider customization options.", "An important component of our strategy is to promote consumer engagement with our brands, and we intent to support virtually all of our upcoming titles with innovative offerings designed to drive recurrent consumer spending. We also released new content for recent titles including additional free updates for Grand Theft Auto Online.", "Turning to our online initiatives in Asia, we continue to make progress on Civilization Online, our free to play mass multiplayer online game developed in partnership with renowned South Korean based studio XLGAMES. The title is expected to enter open beta shortly, which will help to usher in its commercial success \u2013 commercial launch \u2013 during the current fiscal year. In addition to Korea, we plan to bring Civilization Online to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and China through our publishing partnerships with Game First and Qihoo 360.", "Looking ahead to next fiscal year, significant buzz is already building for Mafia III, the next installment in our successful organized crime series. Last month, the title was featured on the cover of Game Informer Magazine, which included an in-depth 12-page story that highlighted the game's key characters, evocative New Orleans setting and bold new direction for the series. Mafia III currently is in development at 2K's Hangar 13 studio and is planned for release during fiscal 2017. 2K and Hangar 13 will reveal more details about the title in the coming months.", "In addition, we announced today that Battleborn, a groundbreaking new first-person shooter from 2K and Gearbox Software, the creators of Borderlands, is now planned for launch on May 3, 2016. We believe that extending development by a few months will allow the team enough time to fully realize the creative vision for Battleborn and enable them to deliver the best entertainment experience possible.", "2K recently revealed Battleborn's competitive five-on-five multiplayer modes, which will complement the game's cooperative story mode. Early next year, Battleborn will have an open beta across all platforms, for which PlayStation 4 owners will receive early access. We very much appreciate consumers anticipation for Battleborn and we are confident that the game will be well worth the extra wait when it launches in May.", "In addition, our worldwide development teams are working on numerous unannounced projects, including new intellectual properties and offerings from our established franchises. Our robust development pipeline extends years into the future and promises to captivate audiences and set new benchmarks for creative excellence.", "Quality remains our watchword and is the foundation of our relationship with our consumers. Everything that we do is based upon this commitment which has been and continues to be our path to long term success.", "I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Karl and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll review our results for the fiscal second quarter and then discuss our outlook for third quarter and fiscal year 2016. All of the numbers I'll be providing today are non-GAAP and all comparisons are year-over-year, unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. In addition, please note that starting this quarter, we are providing on our website additional details regarding the non-GAAP components of our cost of goods sold and operating expenses.", "Starting with our results for the fiscal second quarter, net revenue grew 169% to $364.9 million. This result exceeded our outlook range of $275 million to $325 million, due primarily to stronger than expected revenues from NBA 2K16 and Grand Theft Auto V.", "Digitally delivered revenue grew 57% to $141 million and accounted for 39% of our total net revenue. 51% of digitally delivered revenue was derived from recurrent consumer spending, which increased 39% year-over-year. The largest contributors to digitally delivered revenue were Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and Borderlands. Catalog sales accounted for $165.8 million of net revenue, led by the Grand Theft Auto series and NBA 2K15", "Gross margin decreased to 48%, as this year's launch of NBA 2K and its associated licensing costs were recorded in the second quarter versus in the third quarter last year. Operating expenses were $124.4 million, up by $14 million due to higher marketing for NBA 2K16 and increased personnel expenses. Interest and other expense was $2.6 million. Tax expense was $16.4 million.", "And non-GAAP net income increased to $32.7 million, or $0.30 per share, up from a net loss of $35.4 million or $0.44 per share in the prior year's second quarter. This result exceeded our outlook range of $0.05 to $0.15 per share. On a GAAP basis, we reported net revenue of $347 million and net income of $54.7 million or $0.55 per share.", "Turning to some key items from our balance sheet at September 30, 2015 as compared to June 30, 2015. Our cash and short-term investments balance decreased to $1.06 billion. This equates to net cash of $9.34 per share, which includes the potential dilution from our convertible notes. During the second quarter, we used $26.6 million to repurchase approximately 954,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $27.84 per share.", "Our accounts receivable balance increased to $240.9 million and inventory increased to $24 million, due primarily to the launch of NBA 2K16 at the end of the quarter. And software development costs and licenses increased to $369.3 million, reflecting the development efforts around our pipeline of upcoming releases.", "Now I'll review our financial outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2016, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. Starting with the third quarter, we expect net revenue to range from $400 million to $450 million and net income per share to range from $0.40 to $0.50. Revenue is expected to be driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K16 and WWE 2K16. We expect gross margins in the mid 40%'s.", "Total operating expenses are expected to decrease by approximately 10% due primarily to lower marketing expense. Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 15% of net revenue, based on the midpoint of our outlook range. Our third quarter outlook also reflects interest and other expense of approximately $2 million and weighted average shares of approximately 113 million.", "During the third quarter, we expect to record a tax benefit of approximately $20 million from incentives provided to promote video game development. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate is expected to be 29%. Interest on the convertible notes, net of tax is $1.4 million which should be added back to net income to calculate net income per share.", "Turning to the full year, we are raising our financial outlook to reflect a better than expected second quarter result, strong forecast for the balance of the year and the expected tax benefit; partially offset by the impact of moving the planned launches of Battleborn to May 3, 2016 and XCOM 2 to February 5, 2016. We now expect to deliver net revenue of $1.325 billion to $1.425 billion and net income of $1.00 to $1.15 per share.", "The majority of revenue is expected to come from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K, WWE 2K, the Borderlands series and XCOM 2.", "We expect the revenue breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% 2K and 50% Rockstar Games. We expect our geographic revenue split to be about 55% United States and 45% international. We expect gross margins in the upper 40%'s.", "Total operating expenses are expected to increase by approximately 4% driven primarily by increased personnel expense from a higher head count at our development studios, higher research and development expense and increased depreciation expense.", "Selling and marketing expense is expected to be about 15% of net revenue based on the midpoint of our outlook range. We project interest and other expense of approximately $7 million and weighted average fully diluted shares of approximately 114 million. And our effective tax rate is expected to be 29%, excluding the $20 million tax benefit that we expect to record in the third quarter.", "Interest on the convertible notes, net of tax, is $5.5 million, which should be added back to net income to calculate net income per share.", "We expect our operations to generate cash during the second half of fiscal 2016.", "Our strong performance during the first half of the fiscal year illustrates our ability to deliver consistently, the highest quality entertainment experiences within a financially disciplined organization that fosters creativity and innovation. With our holiday season underway, the balance of this year promises to continue our positive momentum and further enhance our company's sound foundation for the future.", "Thank you. Now, I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie.", "On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another strong quarter for our company. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions.", "Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Ladies and gentlemen. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Strauss, in the press release, you had some comments about a big pipeline ahead or confidence in your pipeline. What can you tell us about the future when we look at Take-Two versus some of the others in the industry? We do have less visibility and we understand that's kind of the nature of the company. But what can you tell us about the pipeline and why do you feel confident about it? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we have talked about some upcoming releases. We talked about Battleborn, of course. We talked about Mafia III and we have titles that we've been bringing in every year, NBA 2K and WWE 2K. And of course, we have recurrent consumer spending in our catalog. So the market has a lot more visibility into our company than ever before. We've also said that we expect to be profitable on an ongoing basis and we've been over-delivering compared to our expectations for some time, pretty regularly. So I hope that gives the market some confidence about our view of our business on a going forward basis.", "Also since 2007, we've successfully launched one new hit property every year in addition to bringing back our beloved franchises over and over again. And while there is no guarantee we'll be able to do that, it certainly is our goal to continue to launch new titles and new hits and new franchises in addition to bringing back sequels of existing franchises. Today, we have 11 titles that with one individual release have sold at least 5 million units. We have over 40 titles that have sold at least a couple of million units.", "So we think it's the best collection of owned intellectual property in the business. So I guess I probably have to use the caveat \u2013 past performance is no guarantee of future success. On the other hand, our strategy speaks for itself, and while we do allow our labels to make product announcements and our product announcements are tailored to marketing, not to analyst calls, we are very proud of our past success and we think we're well positioned going forward.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And maybe one follow up, when you do get some of these blockbuster brands back, the world will have much more digital sales as far as downloads and recurring and other opportunities. Could the margins be higher going forward as these big titles come out?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, they ought to be for a couple of reasons. Recurrent consumer spending is by definition a higher margin business. The shift to digital distribution is a higher margin business. And so those two things matter, and obviously catalog is a higher margin business, and as catalog becomes more reliable and a more important part of our business that is higher margin. So Lainie talked about our margin expected in the upper 40%'s; that's a very significant change from what this company look like just a few short years ago.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC", "Yes, hi. Tim O'Shea here for Brian. Thank you for taking my question. I'm just wondering, at this point in GTA Online's lifecycle, when you release these big content updates like Ill-Gotten Gains or the Freemode Events, what's the impact do you see the player engagement is spending? I'm just curious about what kind of uplift you see at this point in time? And then Strauss, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned the it's \u2013 you had some optimistic comments just around the higher full game downloads. I figured it's worth asking what you're seeing in terms of the percent of games being downloaded and maybe where you expect that to go over time? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. The effect of new content is it increases engagement and when we have more engagement, we have more recurrent consumer spending. I get that stands to reason. We don't release the actual statistics around that \u2013 the actually data around that \u2013 but we do have eight million or more active users weekly for Grand Theft Auto Online. So it's continuing to outperform our expectations and we're very gratified by those results.", "To your question about the percent of purchases that come through digital distribution. For frontline, it could be 20% of our revenue, it could be a bit more than that. For catalog it's a much higher figure, for PC it's a much higher figure.", "Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead with your question.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT", "Thanks for taking my question and I'd like to add my congratulations. I was wondering if you guys could talk about some of the emerging growth areas such as eSports and virtual reality and how you see Take-Two potentially benefiting from those areas down the road? And then on WWE, the brand has been strengthening. You guys are having some early success. Wondering if you can maybe talk about how the title has done in terms of growth versus when you first acquired this brand a couple years ago? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Arvind. In terms of potential areas like eSports or VR, obviously are very different. We were an early \u2013 we made an early bet on eSports \u2013 we had a position in Twitch which was sold to Amazon. It was a very small investment for us, but it was quite successful. We have made our games available for eSports competition. But that's been a more marketing experience than it has been revenue generating. We think it's a very exciting space; it remains to be seen what the nature of monetization can be for companies like ours, but it's certainly a good thing, and creating another form of engagement, just speaks to the robust nature of this entertainment experience, and it's just another reflection of how important interactive entertainment is today to consumers.", "I've talked about virtual reality before. There will be virtual reality headsets hitting the market; there will be software hitting the market. It does remain to be seen how consumers feel about what the nature of an interactive entertainment experience is in VR and how comfortable that experience is.", "We've said that we're involved in R&D in the space. We find it really fascinating. Our creative folks find it fascinating, but there's not much to be said until we see how that market develops. If the market develops in a way that's consistent with the kind of intellectual property we have, we expect to be there and we expect to do well in it, but I think it's too early to call.", "And finally, in terms of WWE, it continues to develop well. I'd just like to make the note that the Metacritic scores are significantly higher this year than last. That's gratifying because we are focused on improving the quality of the title. It seems to be doing very well, certainly exceeding our expectations.", "Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT", "Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question from the line of Eric Handler from AKM \u2013 MKM Partners. Please go ahead with your question.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Thank you very much. I appreciate answering the question. A follow-up on GTA Online and correct me if I'm misstating you, Strauss. I think at the start of the year, you talked about in your expectation for GTA Online, that you didn't \u2013 the expectation was that revenue wasn't going to grow. Now, that we're halfway through the year, it \u2013 has the game \u2013 is the game sort of at a stable run rate from where you were, several quarters or entering the year, or has it accelerated or declined even? And then secondly, with NBA Online in China, I'm just curious, now that the new NBA season is underway, what's being done differently maybe this season in China and how that business has been growing?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think the answer is both businesses are stable and successful. We're really not talking about changes and \u2013 except to say that Grand Theft Auto Online continues to perform well and continues to exceed expectations. And NBA 2K Online in China also continues to perform well and is generating revenue and profits. But we're not giving more detail than that.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey, congratulations on a good quarter. Strauss, thinking about calendar 2016, I assume you're not going to talk about any unannounced releases, but aside from continued hardware growth, what are the most important industry dynamics for your business next year? And then Karl, if you could just say, WWE, should we be modeling that to grow year-over-year for this year? And then finally, Lainie, the $20 million tax benefit, is that a new addition to guidance or was that already in the annual guidance given last quarter? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's \u2013 this is Strauss. In terms of the industry dynamics that really are vivid for us, I would say that there is, when you deliver a title that excites consumers, they seem to like stay engaged and that engagement can be monetized from recurrent consumer spending if you do it right. So we're driven by the idea of delighting consumers, and then we focus on monetization, not the other way around. We think it's crucial for a high quality entertainment company. That's our compact with our consumer. There is no question though that the market is now open minded with regard to ongoing engagement and ongoing spending even after an initial release.", "The second dynamic that's relevant to the shift to digital distribution, which does generate more margin dollars for us and does mean that there's an opportunity for catalog to remain that even if it doesn't make sense to have discs on shelves. So those are both good things and then Lainie will talk about taxes.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "The $20 million tax benefit is a new addition to our guidance for the third quarter and for the year.", "Karl Slatoff - President", "And Ben, you also asked about WWE, it's Karl. Look, obviously, WWE \u2013 the game is \u2013 we're thrilled the way WWE has launched this year. The game is better than last year; I think both the critics and the consumers are acknowledging that. It's really too early. We obviously haven't announced anything about how we're doing but we're very excited about it. And WWE 2K 2015 grew 40% over WWE 2K 2014 and we think this is a better game. So we're obviously very hopeful and excited about this year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.", "Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, thanks. Good afternoon everyone. So as it relates to Battleborn, is there a way to quantify the impact to your fiscal 2016 guidance, moving that game out of the fiscal period? And then secondly, any updated thoughts on how you intend to address the convert that comes due in about a year here? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "So for our convert, we have a \u2013 the $250 million convert matures in December of 2016. So right now, it doesn't make economic sense to take it out, but we'll evaluate it when it matures and see what the company's position is with our cash and what our potential uses are for it and we'll make a decision at that time on how we want to close out that convert.", "The other question on Battleborn, we don't give out specific title-by-title numbers in our guidance, but our guidance overall went up. We had the tax credit, as we just previously mentioned. But our second quarter did much better than we had expected; also the forecasts for our other titles for the remainder of the year is very strong and that more than offset the Battleborn move out of the year.", "Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is (32:07) in for Neil. A quick question with Civilization Online. As you set to do your beta, were there any key lessons you've learned from your experience with NBA 2K Online thus far? And you also haven't mentioned any new games in Asia besides what's in the pipeline, but are you still actively investing in the region \u2013 or maybe titles within the region?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Obviously, there's enormous learning to be had in our experience with NBA 2K Online in China but I'm not trying to capture it in a few short sentences on this call. But we had no experience in massive multiplayer and no experience in China and no experience in free-to-play before we launched that title and now we have a great deal of experience and we developed it in partnership with a phenomenal company, Tencent. So I would hope that we would apply all of that learning to the launch of Civilization Online and we're feeling pretty good about it as we head into an open beta; it remains to be seen but it is looking pretty good.", "In terms of our commitment to Asia, it remains very strong; it's a growth area. And what's exciting about it is, businesses which may be not that interesting in the U.S., for example, massive multiplayer games \u2013 a very tough, very competitive, very expensive business in the U.S. \u2013 can be very interesting opportunities in Asia, which is why we're pursuing them over there. And then with success, we do have the opportunity to bring those around the rest of the world, potentially even including the U.S. So, we think the strategy remain sensible. We've done exceedingly well throughout Asia since we opened our headquarters in Singapore a number of years ago.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay, great. And just one final question. Do you have an update on what looks interesting to you now in the M&A market, especially in light of the King acquisition?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're in the same position, which is, we have a significant amount of cash. We've got a very strong balance sheet. So in addition to returning capital to the shareholders, and we just did that, we just bought back about 1 million shares of stock on what now in today's market, looks like favorable terms. We have the ability to support organic growth, which has really been the story around here. We've grown very significantly organically. And of course, we can support inorganic growth as well to the extent that we maintain our discipline and we focus on accretion to shareholder value, and we're very focused on accretion. So, there's no update to the strategy. The strategy remains the same. We remain open minded on the one hand and disciplined on the other.", "Unknown Speaker", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Great job on another quarter. Congratulations. Curious on the eight million weekly players for GTA Online, Strauss. How that split between prior and current gen, with I guess the backdrop that Rockstar has stopped updating the prior gen experience. And so, I guess I'm sort of wondering in addition to that question, if you anticipate an uplift to 2K15 sales over the holiday as perhaps online players transition to current gen. And I have a follow up.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we're not giving any more detail except to say that the title of GTA V and GTA Online continues to do well and continues to exceed our expectations.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "All right, fair enough. The \u2013 it's worth a shot. The \u2013 this may be problematic as a question as well, but curious looking at Rockstar North, I think the same article that said eight million weekly players that came out maybe a month or two ago, said that there was a fair amount of resources, maybe the majority of Rockstar North, was still working on the development of \u2013 the ongoing development of content for GTA Online. So, I'm curious if you can give us any sort of perspective of the amount of resources from Rockstar that you continue to devote to the ongoing development of that game? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Mike, we don't comment on allocation of any of our resources.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Okay, guys. Great job. Best of luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're pleased that we had another great quarter. We attribute it to continued tight focus on our strategy of being the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in our business. And our results are driven first and foremost by the creativity of thousands of developers who \u2013 we're lucky to have here in the shop \u2013 and by the many people who support those activities to make sure that we do a great job marketing and distributing their titles and also running our business day-to-day. So, once again thanks to our colleagues, thanks to our shareholders and thanks to those who joined the call today. We appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

And continue meaningfully to expand their audience more than two and half years after their initial launch. Grand Theft Auto V remains the highest rated title on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One \u2013 excuse me. And is the must have experience for gamers, especially as install base of the new generation of consoles, continues to grow.", "Today, Grand Theft Auto V is sold in more than 65 million units worldwide. Moreover, engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online continues to be fantastic, with both fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 revenues up year-over-year. Rockstar Games has driven sustained engagement, with the Grand Theft Auto Online by delighting audiences with the regular release of free content updates. And there are many more on the way to keep these communities driving, Rockstar games is, of course, also hard at work and some exciting future projects that will be revealed soon.", "NBA 2K16 is continued to build on our industry-leading basketball series track record of annual growth. The title has outperformed our expectations and remains poised to become our highest selling sports game ever with selling of nearly 7.5 million units, up double-digits versus the same period for the prior release. NBA 2K is benefited from strong player engagement and sales of the games virtual currency have been the largest contributor to recurrent consumer spending next to Grand Theft Auto Online.", "During fiscal 2016, recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K grew 70% year-over-year, driven both by online play and the My NBA 2K companion app. The NBA 2K experience has become much more than traditional sports simulation game. It's a true sports RPG that incorporates deep storylines along with pop music and culture. This evolution has helped to broaden its appeal beyond sports fans with revenue from the series increasing at an extraordinary 31% compound annual growth rate over the past seven fiscal years. We believe that we can continue to expand NBA 2K's loyal fan base as well as drive increased engagement recurrent consumer spending for years to come.", "Our annual WWE 2K series is also continued to grow with WWE 2K16! Crossing the 3 million unit selling mark, during the fourth quarter. And revenue from the title has been further enhanced by the success of its downloadable add on content including the season pass. Since acquiring the license in February 2013, we've grown unit sales every year, reversing the negative trend under the former publisher.", "During its peak from 2007 through 2009, the WWE video game series sold 6 million to 7 million units per year. Today, the WWE brand remains as popular and vibrant as ever and we believe we can continue to grow sales by further leveraging the development and marketing expertise of 2K in visual concepts, which are responsible for the tremendous success of NBA 2K.", "During fiscal 2016, we extended our long-term partnership with WWE, and we look forward to many more years of successful collaboration. During the fourth quarter, 2K launched XCOM 2, which was developed by the strategy experts of Firaxis Games.

XCOM 2 is being supported with an array of add-on content, including the Anarchy's Children and Alien Hunters packs that are available now, which should enable XCOM 2 to achieve the long tail success that Firaxis Games strategy titles typically experienced.", "During fiscal 2016, we continue to capitalize in our industry's ongoing transition towards digital distribution. We generated record digitally delivered revenue of $835.2 million, which grew 36% year-over-year and accounted for 54% of our total net revenue. Recurrent consumer spending grew 33% year-over-year to its highest level ever and accounted for 26% of our total net revenue.", "In addition of virtual currency for Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by other offerings including downloadable add-on content led by Borderlands, WWE 2K, Sid Meier's Civilization and Evolve, WWE SuperCard, which has now been downloaded more than 10 million times, and it's our most financially successful free-to-play mobile offering. And NBA 2K Online in China, which delivered record revenues and now has over 31 million registered users.", "Continuing to drive increased engagement with our titles remains a key strategic priority for our organization and is one of our most important long-term growth and margin expansion opportunities. We now support virtually all of our new releases with innovative offerings designed to achieve this objective.", "Our results also benefited from strong growth in full game downloads, with over 20% of units for new gen consoles and over 90% of units for PC delivered digitally. In addition, it bears noting that approximately half of our catalog sales for old gen consoles are being delivered through digital download. Digital distribution is disproportionately benefiting our catalog, as it gives consumers the opportunity to buy older titles that no longer receive physical shelf space.", "In particular, Rockstar Games has been having tremendous success with their hit PlayStation 2 titles such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Bully, which are now available for download in the PlayStation 4, via the consoles emulation technology. Rockstar Games is the top publisher in the PlayStation 2 classics and PlayStation 4 program with three of the five highest selling games.", "Today, we believe Take-Two is better positioned than ever for long-term success.

The opportunities for interactive entertainment on emerging platforms, such as tablets and smartphones and in developing markets, such as China and Korea, are expanding rapidly. And we're actively pursuing these sectors with the highly disciplined approach.", "We have that, we believe that the best collection of owned intellectual property in the business and the extraordinary success of our products is creating greater demand from consumers worldwide, which in turn creates increased opportunities for our company.

The largest contributor to digitally-delivered revenue were Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and XCOM 2.", "Catalog sales accounted for $211.3 million of net revenue, led by Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands. Gross margin was 46.4%. The decrease is due primarily to higher amortization of capitalized software development costs, partially offset by growth in digitally-delivered revenue.

Interest and other expense was $0.2 million, as we generated higher interest income in the last year's fourth quarter.", "We recorded a tax benefit of $2.5 million, which includes $5.4 million in tax benefits related to video game development costs.

We're well positioned to deliver growth and margin expansion over the long term. Thank you.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another strong year for our company. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Olson", "Hey, good afternoon. Congratulations on strong quarter. I was just curious, there were some changes in the industry and wondering how you are thinking about Take-Two being affected or not affected by some of those changes in the ecosystems that would be around PlayStation 4.5 and new Nintendo console, virtual reality, I guess, you mentioned eSports, are those various things, opportunities, challenges or in different for Take-Two? Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "I think in general, these are all opportunities depending on how things pencil out. A successful new console gives us another opportunity to release titles, whomever it comes from. ESports is a very exciting area that we talked about in today's call. We are just beginning to participate through our NBA 2K tournament. I think the fact that there were 92,000 teams that were involved, it's pretty extraordinary. Right now, eSports still tends to, via marketing vehicle for our games and create more engagement. But we are able to monetize that engagement with the return of consumer spendings, so that certainly a good thing. And I've talked a bit about VR in the past, and there's a lot of excitement in the marketplace and lot of our people are excited to. We're still in R&D mode run through, because this is, you know still not a consumer business. We want to be really clear if this is the consumer's platform of choice, we'll bring our intellectual property to it aggressively and ambitiously.", "We just tend not to go and we don't have to, you know the vote that we cast is, he were ever the consumer is, that's channel, distribution vehicle, platform product type, geography, and be there with the best intellectual property in the market. And where we don't have to worry, we don't. So, the winds that are back its also our competitors back, we think that people are win most are those that are the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient and that's what we aspired to be.", "Mike Olson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from line of Eric Handler from MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Handler", "Yes, thanks for, thanks for the question. Two questions for here. On GTA Online, you know last year, and fiscal 2016, you thought there be some moderation. You're expecting some moderation now in fiscal 2017. Are you seeing anything to suggest right now in your monthly data that there is in fact, a slowdown going on. And then secondly for Lainie. How you guys treating the convert that you have, that you have coming due in December in your guidance and what's weighing on the cash flow outlook for the year?", "Strauss Zelnick", "So in terms of GTA Online, I've seen the way you do Eric which is, you know in fact, it has performed better than all of our expectations, and that's certainly gratifying and I think that's a reflection of how amazing GTA V is, how fantastic GTA Online is and how great the additional content drops have been. And we have been very pleased by the continuing results, it's more than two and a half years after the initial release, and yet results continue to be up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So we can't quite say, and when results were moderate so far, the title continues to perform very well indeed. But at some point, once expectation would be for the moderating results. Lainie?", "Lainie Goldstein", "So they convert more accounting for the convert as if they are to be settled in the stock, which is what is included in our guidance right now. But it's does our current intent, but we have the option to settle in either cash or stock. So when we get close to the maturity date we'll evaluate the best way to settle the convert. We can look at where our cash balance is at that times but right now at the end of the year, we were at $1.2 billion to the strong balance and we'll see, if the potential uses for that cash are and we'll determine, what our best option is at that time.", "Eric Handler", "And then that the free cash flow, was there anything particular that's weighing on your view that it be modestly positive?", "Lainie Goldstein", "Yes. So continuing to invest in the game development for a pipeline and also IT related fixed asset expenses.", "Eric Handler", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter from Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.", "Ben Schachter", "Hey, guys. Congratulations on another great year. A few questions, one I think, I know the answer, but just to clarify all the guidance there and all the figures that have been so far include only the announced title date, that's the first question. Second question, Strauss I think you mentioned that you expect FY 2018 revenue and earnings to grow, if you could discuss, why you have confidence to give that to give so much guidance today? And then finally, any update on just how you're thinking about the cash and how you're thinking about M&A in general? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "So, to your first question, just to clarify, we've announced the entire release schedule for the year and that's what you should expect our release schedule to be and that's what our outlook is based on, any changes would be performance based largely.", "In terms of \u2013 I'm going to skip to question three, which is cash uses. Our view remains the same, which is there are three potential uses; support, organic growth, which has been our story all along, has been a very good story, and we do think there are wonderful opportunities for organic growth, whether that's new types of products or expanding our focus in other geographies like Asia, which has been very fruitful for us or supporting new platforms as they develop or new, other new opportunities like eSports.", "There are opportunities for inorganic those tend to sort of come along when you least expect them, that's why we believe cash is a strategic asset. We are very disciplined, we do believe in doing accretive deals that thus distinguish us from some of our competitors historically and retrospectively that's been a very good call on our part. And then of course, we believe we're returning cash to the shareholders. In the past several years, we've purchased about $300 million worth of stock and we certainly have an opportunity to do so in the future, we have an outstanding authorization for buyback.", "Would you mind repeating your second question because I seem to miss it?", "Ben Schachter", "You mentioned that you expected growth, I think on both revenue and earnings for FY 2018. So, looking do you have a confidence to say that now?", "Strauss Zelnick", "That was more comment than a question or was there a question in there?", "Ben Schachter", "What gives you confidence...", "Strauss Zelnick", "What gives me confidence. Yeah, it's what we're working on at our development studios.", "Lainie Goldstein", "We have very good visibility into our pipeline and given what we see and also our ability to continue to grow recurring consumer spending in the context of great new releases that gives us high confidence in fiscal year 2018 growth.", "Ben Schachter", "Great. Thanks and good luck.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Timothy Shea", "Hi, yes hi. Just \u2013 this is Tim O'Shea first for Brian. Thank you for taking my questions. So, just another one on the outlook, I know that Lainie mentioned the higher OpEx in a tax and taxes next year. But I was just hoping you might help us to understand the specific situation that might be driving to disconnect between top line growth and EPS growth outlook for fiscal 2017. Is there a game, that's going to be less profitable than expected or maybe I noticed that large deferred revenue outlook, just how should we interpret that and then I had a quick follow-up? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Well, for next year, when we're looking at the disconnect in terms of the bottom-line. What you said is true, our \u2013 we don't have a big of a tax benefit, we've $0.33 per share this year and next year we're are going to only have $0.14 per share. And then also our operating expenses are going to increase about 29%, primarily due to higher marketing expense.", "Our margins are higher, so it doesn't \u2013 so the pipeline is set and is strong and it's just the big difference, because of the marketing expense as well as the taxes.", "Timothy Shea", "Okay, got it. Thank you. And then, just broadly speaking, this is a higher level question, but we've seen some consolidation across the space, with the biggest games in each category, taking more market share. I am just curios, first of all you would agree with that sentiment and if so, how that trend towards consolidation impact of any decisions around both your larger franchises like GTA and NBA and maybe also your smaller ones, which may not be category leaders? Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah. I mean, in this instance we would agree with what you're observing, which is that the bigger and better are getting stronger and that's consistent with the nature of the entertainment business, which is as entertainment businesses mature, a greater proportion of consumer attention and therefore revenue goes to the highest quality releases. Essentially when entertainment businesses are nascent, people are willing to experiment among another number of brands as they mature all consumers pace tend to narrow on focus on the biggest titles in the businesses has been true from time and memorial since the beginning of the electronic entertainment business across every different type.", "And it's why, we've had this strategy that we've had at this company, which is put out \u2013 creating put out the highest quality releases and do a limited numbers so you can really focus and focus not just on your existing IP but try to launch new successful IP every year and we've been able to do that most years, since we took over the company and that's why we have 11 titles that have each sold over 5 million units and an individual release and something like 45 that have each sold 2 million units or more in this release, which we think is the standard bearer of the industry. So, yes the strong gets stronger and that was true in motion pictures and television and the music, it's going to be true in interactive entertainment. And that puts pressure on us and on our key competitors to continue to deliver the highest quality titles and focus on doing so. So we see it as an opportunity as much as a challenge and certainly for the haves, it's a much better place to be than have not.", "Timothy Shea", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia from CRT Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Arvind Bhatia", "Okay. Thank you and I'd like to add my congratulations guys. This is for Strauss, Karl or Lainie, as you go back to this time last year, you started with guidance of $0.75 to a $1. Obviously you delivered earnings that were significantly higher than that. As you look back would say that most of the upside was from GTA V and GTA Online, perhaps you could review the top three reasons you were able to deliver that much upside?", "And then my second question is specifically on Mafia III. If you can maybe provide a framework for us to be able to kind of think about the scale of this to be able to model it, maybe talk about the marketing support, other things that you're doing and how you're modeling it, perhaps, as at this point? Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "So in terms of our guidance from this past year, when we set our original guidance, it was our best estimate at the time when we gave out these numbers. We had a very lively schedule. And as you mentioned, some of our titles performed stronger than we had expected GTA V and GTA Online and that coupled with our tax credit is what helps us to have these fantastic results for this year.", "Karl Slatoff", "And, Arvind, in terms of Mafia III, obviously, this is a title that we're very, very excited about here from the creative perspective, and but also from a commercial perspective. We think this title has the perfect combination of what people are looking for in open world story based driven title with a lot of things that a lot of games don't have, a lot of time and money is going in to, so we've got a great creative team, team led by Haden Blackman. So we are very excited about this title and the prospects of this title.", "And when you get this right in this particular genre, you can obviously achieve significant success. In terms of \u2013 and we've done that before in general. So in terms of providing you with a specific model that you can go by, I don't have anything specific for you to go there. But I can tell you that our expectation is that we should be exceeding anything that we've ever done on the Mafia side before, again from a credit perspective and a commercial perspective. So you can always look at the previous Mafia titles as the benchmark, but again, I wouldn't stake too much on that, because we think this time we're vastly exceed what Mafia, the previous Mafia that has been able to accomplish over the past.", "Arvind Bhatia", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Douglas Creutz", "Thanks. You mentioned that you've had success with some of your older Grand Theft Auto titles from the PS2 or on the PS4 with the ability to play older titles. Just wondering, if there's any apatite there for actually doing remas or just some of those older titles into HD. Is that something sort of conceptually that you think would be a worthwhile use of your talent and time?", "Strauss Zelnick", "That's something that the labels will decide and talk about in due course. Certainly, we wouldn't rule it out, it will be largely an economic decision. I don't \u2013 we wouldn't do anything that's not going to look great creatively. So the starting point is, if this kind of the like consumers, is this going to look good. You know that we're a company that is not driven first and foremost by can we create revenue this way. We will be start by saying, will this be exciting to consumers, will they be happy with it, will it reflect well on our brands, will it reflect well on our company. And if the answer is yes, then it may well be a compelling opportunity. But if the answer is in different or no, then even if we have an opportunity to make few bucks, we probably would decline. So I think that's the lens through which we look, the actual decisions are made by the labels.", "Douglas Creutz", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. Hi. This is [ph] Alex signing in for Neil. You mentioned the release slate is pretty \u2013 is confirmed for the year. But does that include any content drops in DLC in other words could we possibly see content that may not otherwise be baked in at the moment? And then the second question is regarding NBA 2K, there's been really strong growth in registered users. Just wondering, if you can share any maybe additional metrics like active users, there are paying users and then the strategy that drive a greater number of players to pay or is it just to drive higher ARPU per paying user? And if we can see maybe potential other revenue streams like ad-based streams for those that aren't paying? Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "So in terms of our outlook, we have contemplated recurrent consumer spending in the outlook. We contemplated product drops, there could be changes there and perhaps there is some opportunity, but this is the outlook as we see it now and we contemplated all aspects of our business, but things can change. In terms of metrics, we haven't really shared a great deal of metrics on our in-game spending, we give the broad, certainly give the broad numbers around recurrent consumer spending and it's been great nearly more than a quarter of our non-GAAP net revenue last fiscal year was recurrent consumer spending.", "So certainly, the numbers are meaningful and we have mentioned that we've 31 million users, signed-up users of Grand Theft Auto \u2013 oh, sorry of NBA 2K Online in China. So we have mentioned that metric. We have talked about usage of Grand Theft Auto Online in the fourth quarter. So we've given some metrics, we don't tend to give a broad array of metrics, because this is still a work in progress and still developing activity here, and because we don't want to people to extrapolate even though the results have been excellent, we don't want to extrapolate that they're perpetually a nice gentle upward sloping curve. Is it just too early in our experience, we have to see that.", "In terms of our strategy, our strategy \u2013 and I know it sounds like motherhood and apple pie, but it genuinely is our strategy. We're trying to delight consumers as they engage in our products. And when we make a content drop, we want that to be something exciting to consumers. And we know if we do that, then we will increase engagement and therefore we will increase spending and therefore we'll increase revenue and profits. And of course we are a profit-seeking enterprise, we are focused on squealing that we are well more profit company.", "But the way entertainment businesses survive and thrive with the backdrop, as Lainie mentioned of being exceedingly efficient, well organized, professionally manage and physically highly disciplined, but with that backdrop, our focus turns entirely to creativity. And that creativity surrounds what's going to make consumers most excited about our titles and most excited about our brands and most engaged with our titles and repeatedly engage with our titles.", "And then as they are engaged, we need to give them opportunities to spend. That in and of itself enhances the game experience, doesn't detract from it and we don't put up toll booths, we don't annoy our consumers, we simply get paid along the way. And that's what we aim to do and that has had a great results around here. But many of our competitors are actually proud of the fact that they're primarily data-driven, that they're focused on the content supporting the data that supports the purchases, that supports the revenue that supports the profitability, we do not do it that way. We are creative, we make an incredible entertainment experience and then we seek to monetize it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey from the Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Hickey", "Hey, guys. Congratulations off on quarter and thanks for taking my question. To the \u2013 I'm curious when you released new content for GTA Online, did you see a corresponding impact or sales impact to base game GTA V bringing that sort of the marketing vehicle to maybe new installed over maybe prior gen players crossing over to the current gen experience where obviously there is new content coming out?", "And then I guess due par that question is, I guess what sort of Nebula is thinking about the pipeline for GTA Online content, but would you sort of characterize it as not the same amount of content coming out this year or more or less that would be helpful? And I have a quick follow-up.", "Karl Slatoff", "Yes, it's a good question, Mike. I don't \u2013 you know GTA V has continued to sell. As you know, we've talked about the unit sales, certainly there has been great news there because we've sold so many units. We have not tracked what happens to the GTA V sales when new content has dropped into GTA Online. So, we'd be speculating about what influence there would be. But I think anything that makes GTA Online exciting is the GTA V and I do expect that it's going to continue to be a very strong title going forward \u2013 it's great catalogue title over time, this is a history \u2013 any guy that would be the case. In terms of the pipeline for online content on an ongoing basis, that's something for Rockstar to talk about in due time, but there is content coming.", "Michael Hickey", "Okay, cool. The last question. Gearbox had sort of \u2013 some encouraging, I guess commentary on the initial sales of Battleborn. It's sort of reflected on Borderlands and I think it was may be outpacing that a bit and my impression was it's sort of just it may be was the slower start, but had the potential to build into something meaningful on, I think Borderlands life to date has done maybe 8 million units. And so, so curious if you share that enthusiasm for the future sales potential of Battleborn? And then, also I remember Borderlands had done pretty well, in terms of attaching digital content. But I am sort of curious on more Bord sales curve, if you'd seen sort of outside success in terms of full game download of that game? Thanks guys.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah. I mean the initial results are very encouraging, which is I think we can properly took away from those comments, but it is early. The scores are good, consumers like it, lot of people playing it and really loving the game play. But I wouldn't want you to draw conclusion that the Battleborn curve is necessarily the Borderlands curve, because we just don't have any of that information yet. So we're encouraged and we feel good about it, remains to be seen how it performs. And in terms of our ongoing digital content, we've said there is more content coming, again, we'll leave the specifics to the label.", "Michael Hickey", "Yeah, I guess, and I was meaning to ask out the percentage of sales, full game download versus physical?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah. I don't think we've talked about it, yet, Mike.", "Michael Hickey", "Okay. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Drew Crum from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.", "Drew Crum", "Okay. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. So, as far as the fiscal 2017 revenue guidance is concerned, does it assume digital growth and more specifically growth for recurrent consumer spending? And then, separately one of your competitors yesterday talked very bullishly about the opportunity in Asia maybe you can kind of reset or talk about what the company strategy is in that market, as you enter fiscal 2017?", "Karl Slatoff", "So for digital, our financial outlook seems that we are going to generate modestly lower digitally delivered revenue in fiscal 2017 like a percent decline in the mid-single-digit. This is driven by our assumption that recurrent consumer spending will be moderately lower around 10% and for game downloads will be roughly flat. For recurrent consumer spending, we expected to be lower based on our assumptions that quick and virtual currency for NBA 2K and higher revenues from downloadable add-on content for variety of our titles will be more than offset the moderating revenue from Grand Theft Auto Online.", "And we expect our full game downloads to be roughly flat as last year benefited from the launch of Grand Theft Auto V for PC. But over the long-term, we expected digitally delivered revenue to grow and as we continue to execute our strategy to drive greater engagement and recurrent consumer spending and as our industry transitions more towards full game downloads, we expect it to grow over the long-term.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yeah. And in terms of \u2013 this is Strauss, in terms of Asia, our Asia strategy was set in motion a number of years ago when we opened the headquarters in Singapore, became a publisher in Japan and entered a number of other markets. And then, we also tried new kinds of products that we fell would be quite challenging for launch in Europe or in the U.S., but could be opportunity to launch in Asia, largely free to play mass of multiplayer games. We've had strong results with NBA 2K Online in China, we mentioned those as part of today's call. We've launched Civilization Online in Korea and that will also launched in number of other Asian markets. And we are working on number of other really interesting opportunities. So that business is already been very fruitful for us, it's grown from a very small part of our business to a meaningful part of our business and it's a very exciting for the world and people's appetite for games is so much different than here in U.S. or in Europe with a significant focus on massive multiplayer games and a significant focus on the free-to-play model.", "So, we don't believe that all models work in all markets, we think you have to tailor what we bring to a particular market for the needs and desires of the consumers in that market. So, we're incredibly excited about Asia.", "I would just like to make the comment that we as an industry are just scratching the surface in China of what's possible. And I do believe and maybe contrarian point of view, but I think that an area of China that remained very challenging, which has been the distribution of Western products, I think the Chinese government realized more and more that it is actually not challenging, that it's actually beneficial that what consumers want, that it will not cost consumers to have a view of Chinese society that isn't any way unfortunate for the government and I think restrictions will probably be loosen. My guess is not within the next 12 months, but I do believe in the coming years and that's going to be incredible news for us because of course the middle class alone in China is bigger than all U.S. households.", "So, we think that there is an amazing opportunity there, we're poised for the opportunity, naturally we comply with government regulations wherever we are in the world and China is no exception. But I am of the view that it's time for restrictions to be softened and that it will beneficial for Chinese society as they see it, not just as I see it and I do believe that creates some massive opportunity for us and not reflected in this year's numbers, next year's number or anyone's outlook for the industry.", "Drew Crum", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, thank you so much for joining us today. We're very pleased with our results, we're proud of our outlook, but what we're really proud of is our colleagues are all around the world, almost 3,000 of them who engaged every day in trying to make the very best interactive entertainment properties on earth, to bring them to market and to run really solid, serious and responsible business in making sure that we delight consumers as they experience our products.", "So, we are \u2013 we feel very grateful to have an opportunity to work in this business about which we're so passionate, grateful to our colleagues and we're really pleased with the results.

Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2017 is off to a solid start, with first quarter net revenue up 13% year-over-year. Our results were driven by the continued strong performance of Grand Theft Auto V and NBA 2K16, coupled with growth in recurrent consumer spending, including record bookings from Grand Theft Auto Online. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, once again performed significantly better than we'd anticipated, and continue to generate remarkable results as they have in every quarter since their release.", "According to new data from the NPD Group, which combines physical sales and full game downloads Grand Theft Auto V was the number two selling game across all platforms in 2015 and is the number three selling game of 2016 year-to-date through June.", "In addition, Grand Theft Auto Online continues to grow with the game delivering record bookings in the first quarter. Rockstar Games has driven sustained engagement and increased recurrent consumer spending by exciting audiences with the ongoing release of a rich array of free additional content, most recently with the Further Adventures in Finance and Felony, Power Play and Cunning Stunts Updates, and has many more updates still to come. The incredible staying power of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online nearly three years after their original release, reflects that these titles remain the standard bearers for excellence in our industry and underscores consumer's tireless passion for this iconic series.", "In another testament to the strength of Rockstar Games creative portfolio, the highly demanded 2010 classic Red Dead Redemption was made available to play in Xbox One as part of Microsoft's backwards compatibility program on July 8. Red Dead Redemption remains one of the most critically acclaimed entertainment experiences ever launched and is Rockstar Games highest selling title aside from Grand Theft Auto.", "Every owner of Red Dead Redemption for Xbox 360 can now play the game directly on their Xbox One, regardless of which version of the title they own and for those who have yet to experience it, Red Dead Redemption is also currently available for purchase through digital download from the Games Store on Xbox One. Rockstar Games is also hard at work on some exciting future projects that will be revealed soon.", "NBA 2K16 has continued to build on our industry-leading basketball series trend of annual growth and is now our highest selling sports game ever with selling of over 8 million units. Revenue from NBA 2K has benefited from strong player engagement and sales of the game's virtual currency were once again the largest contributor to bookings from recurrent consumer spending next to Grand Theft Auto Online.", "During the first quarter, bookings from recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K grew more than 50% year-over-year, driven both by online play and the free-to-play MyNBA 2K companion app. We believe we can continue to expand NBA 2K's loyal fan base as well as drive increased engagement and recurrent consumer spending for years to come. On May 3, 2K released Battleborn, a new intellectual property from Gearbox Software, the makers of our popular Borderlands Series. While the game launched to solid reviews, its performance in the market has been below our expectations. We think there remains an opportunity to grow the audience for this unique experience over time, and 2K will continue to drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending on the title through add-on content and virtual currency.", "Innovation and creativity are among our core tenets, and we fully support our team's vision to push the envelope in order to set new benchmarks for our company and our industry with the understanding that in a highly creative enterprise, not everything always turns out the way one might like. Given the strength and diversity of our company, we have the ability to take these risks and weather any unexpected shortfalls that may arise.", "During the first quarter, digitally delivered bookings exceeded our expectations. Recurrent consumer spending grew 22% year-over-year, while full game downloads declined as expected as last year's first quarter benefited from the launch of Grand Theft Auto V for PC. In addition of virtual currency for Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by other offerings, including downloadable add-on content led by XCOM 2, Sid Meier's Civilization V in the Borderlands series, and free-to-play games, including WWE's SuperCard, which has now been downloaded nearly 11 million times, and NBA 2K Online in China, which now has over 32 million registered users.", "Looking ahead, we are excited about our upcoming holiday lineup which features eagerly anticipated new offerings from some of our most successful franchises, including Mafia III and Sid Meier's Civilization VI, as well as groundbreaking new releases from our annual sports series, NBA 2K and WWE 2K. Karl will have more to share on these titles shortly.", "In addition, we have a robust development pipeline that extends well beyond the fiscal year, and we expect to grow bookings and cash flow from operations in fiscal 2018. Today our company is just beginning to realize its potential from advances in technology that influence how we create, distribute and experience interactive entertainment to the expanding globalization of our audiences. There has never been a more exciting time for our industry. Take-Two is well prepared to capitalize on these positive trends, strategically, creatively, and financially. As a result, we are positioned to achieve continued success and deliver returns for our shareholders over the long-term.", "I will now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff - President", "Thanks, Strauss. Today, I would like to discuss our recent releases and upcoming lineup for the holiday season. On July 7, 2K and Turtle Rock Studios launched Evolve Stage 2, a new free to play version of Evolve, exclusively for PC through Steam. Evolve Stage 2 features a completely overhauled experience, including a new game design and mechanics, as well as improved game-play balance and system performance.", "Players, who previously purchased Evolve on Steam, as well as any add-on content such as skins or characters, will be granted founder status, and all of their paid content will carry over into Evolve Stage 2. In addition, founders will get exclusive badges and other items at launch, as well as additional new content as the game is updated over time.", "Evolve Stage 2 welcomed over 1 million new players in its first week of availability and continues to attract new fans. On September 13, 2K will release BioShock: The Collection for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. For the first time, BioShock, BioShock 2, and BioShock Infinite will be made available in one collection, complete with all previously released single player downloadable add-on content, all completely remastered for new generation consoles in full high resolution with up to 60 frames per second.", "In addition, BioShock: The Collection, includes a never before seen video series Director's Commentary: Imagining BioShock, which features insights from the creator of the series, Ken Levine.", "Consumers who already purchased the PC versions of BioShock, BioShock 2, and/or Minerva's Den through Steam will be able to upgrade to the remastered versions for free. The BioShock series remains one of the most beloved franchises in gaming, and great care has been taken to meticulously preserve the developers' visions for the unforgettable worlds of Rapture and Columbia.", "On September 20, 2K will release NBA 2K17, which will feature Indiana Pacers' All-Star shooting guard, Paul George, as the game's cover athlete and continue the series' proud tradition of working with the NBA's most elite athletes.", "NBA 2K17 also will celebrate the legacy of Kobe Bryant by featuring the recently retired 18 time NBA All-Star on the cover of the NBA 2K17 Legend Edition.

Today we are announcing that 2K now plans to release XCOM 2 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 27 in North America and September 30 internationally.", "This short delay was necessary to ensure that the game is fully polished at launch and meets the team's high standards for the critically acclaimed PC hit. 2K and Firaxis Games are excited to broaden the audience for this beloved series, and they will also continue to support the PC version of XCOM 2 with free and paid downloadable content.", "On October 7, 2K will launch Mafia III. Currently, in development at 2K's Hangar 13 studio, Mafia III is the next installment in our successful organized crime series. Set in New Bordeaux, a re-imagined New Orleans circa 1968, Mafia III places players in the role of gifted antihero, Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam vet determined to take revenge on the Italian mob for betraying and murdering his surrogate family.", "Mafia III will take the series in a bold new direction by combining its trademark, cinematic storytelling with a dynamic open world. Mafia III had a fantastic showing at E3, earning more than 60 accolades at the show, including 12 awards and a host of Top 10 recognitions. We believe Mafia III has the potential to be the breakout hit for what is already a highly successful series.", "On October 11, 2K will launch WWE 2K17 and take our popular sports entertainment series to exciting new heights. Brock Lesnar, who is best known for his unparalleled accomplishments in WWE, UFC and NCAA Division 1 wrestling, will be the game's cover superstar.", "In addition, legendary WCW and WWE star, Bill Goldberg, will return to action as part of the game's preorder campaign. And WWE NXT, the global brand that creates and develops emerging WWE superstars, will serve as a focus for this year's Collector's Edition.", "Later this month, WWE 2K17 will be part of the WWE SummerSlam weekend in New York. We are confident that Yuke's and Visual Concepts will continue to innovate this series and build on its positive momentum.", "On October 21, 2K will release Sid Meier's Civilization VI, the latest offering from our award-winning, turn-based strategy series that is sold in over 35 million units worldwide. Developed by Firaxis Games, Civilization VI will mark the 25th anniversary of the series and provide the most detailed, vivid and beautiful experience ever featured in a Civilization game.", "As players race to achieve victory in this all-new title, active research of technology and culture will unlock new potential ways to play, cities will physically expand across the map, and world leaders will pursue their own agendas based on their historical character traits.", "Civilization VI also had a terrific E3, earning over 30 nominations and winning 15 awards, including Best Strategy Game honors from Game Informer and IGN as well as Best Strategy Game and Best PC Game from the official E3 Game Critics Awards. In addition to our frontline releases, we will continue to deliver an array of digitally delivered offerings designed to drive engagement with, and recurrent consumer spending on our titles.", "Later this month, 2K will have a major presence at Gamescom in Germany. Fans and the media will have the opportunity to get hands-on time with NBA 2K17, WWE 2K17, BioShock: The Collection, and Civilization VI, as well as experience a developer-led theater presentation of Mafia III.", "We are confident that this show will further whet consumer appetite for what we believe will be one of 2K's strongest holiday lineups. With a diverse range of genres represented, this set of holiday releases exemplifies 2K's commitment to providing uncompromising, AAA entertainment experiences.", "Looking beyond the current fiscal year, we have a robust long-term development pipeline across both of our labels, which features offerings from our renowned franchises, along with new intellectual properties that promise to further diversify our industry leading portfolio.", "I will now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Begin by discussing the changes to our non-GAAP financial metrics and then turn to our fiscal first-quarter results and financial outlook for the remainder of the year.", "As announced earlier this week, we are no longer reporting non-GAAP financial measures just for the net effect from referrals of net revenue and related cost of goods sold. We are making these changes to comply with the SEC's updated compliance and disclosure interpretation issued on May 17. These changes to our non-GAAP measures will have no effect on Take-Two's business, GAAP net revenue, GAAP earnings, cash flow, balance sheet, or how our management and Board of Directors evaluates the company's performance.", "In order to help investors who may wish to continue to evaluate our company's performance based on the same measures that we focus on internally, we are providing the following additional metrics: the change in deferred revenue, which can be added to our GAAP net revenue to arrive at the metric that we formerly reported as non-GAAP net revenue; the change in deferred cost of goods sold, which can be added to our new non-GAAP cost of goods sold to arrive at our old calculation of non-GAAP cost of goods sold; and the net effects from deferral of net revenue and related cost of goods sold, which can be added to our new non-GAAP net income to arrive at our old calculation of non-GAAP net income.", "Please note that we do not defer all cost of goods sold related to deferred revenue, including internal and external royalties, which are calculated based on the performance of our business under our old non-GAAP metrics and will continue to be calculated that way going forward.", "In addition, we are introducing a new operational metric, bookings, which represents the total amount billed by the company from sales of physical products sold into retail and available to consumers net of allowances, plus products digitally delivered to consumers during the period. We are reporting these metrics as they are used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate the performance of our business.", "I will now review our first quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Our press release provides a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements, and we have provided additional details regarding the non-GAAP components of our cost of goods sold and operating expenses on our website. In addition, our press release provides a table showing how to bridge the new non-GAAP presentation of our first quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2016 results to the old non-GAAP presentation.", "Turning to the highlights of our results, GAAP net revenue growth grew 13% to $311.6 million. Growth was driven primarily by the recognition of previously deferred revenues from Grand Theft Auto V and NBA 2K16. GAAP net revenue benefited from a change in deferred net revenue of $39 million versus being reduced by a change of $91.1 million last year.", "GAAP digitally delivered net revenue grew 12% to $172.1 million. GAAP digitally delivered net revenue was reduced by a change in deferred net revenue of $19.1 million versus being reduced by $100 million last year. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $187 million, down by $10.9 million. This decline was due primarily to lower internal royalties, which are calculated based on the performance of our business under our old non-GAAP metrics.", "Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was increased by a change in deferred cost of goods sold of $24.6 million versus being reduced by a change of $0.1 million last year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $148.5 million, up by $28.8 million due primarily to higher marketing expense for the launches of Battleborn and our upcoming lineup. GAAP net loss narrowed to $38.6 million or $0.46 per share as compared to $67 million or $0.81 per share.", "Non-GAAP net loss narrowed to $17.6 million or $0.21 per share as compared to $33.2 million or $0.40 per share. And the net effect from deferral of net revenue and related cost of goods sold was a benefit to non-GAAP net income of $11.3 million versus a reduction of $67.4 million in the prior year. Our cash and short-term investments balance decreased to $1.19 billion at June 30 as compared to March 31, due primarily to our ongoing investments in game development.", "Turning to our operational metrics, total bookings were $253.4 million as compared to $353.8 million in last year's first quarter, which had benefited from the launch of Grand Theft Auto V for PC. Total bookings exceeded our expectations driven primarily by the continued outperformance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. Digitally delivered bookings were $172.7 million led by Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and Battleborn. Bookings from our current consumer spending grew 22% and accounted for 60% of digitally delivered bookings or 41% of total bookings.", "As calculated pursuant to our prior non-GAAP measures, our fiscal first quarter results would have included non-GAAP net revenue of $272.6 million, which is based on GAAP net revenue of $311.6 million, excluding the $39 million benefit from the change in deferred net revenue, and non-GAAP net loss of $28.9 million or $0.34 per share, which is based on our new presentation of non-GAAP net loss of $17.6 million, excluding the $11.3 million benefit from the net effects from deferral of net revenue and related cost of goods sold.", "These results exceeded our prior non-GAAP net revenue outlook of $225 million to $260 million, and were within our prior non-GAAP net loss outlook of $0.30 to $0.40 per share.", "Now I will review the highlights of our financial outlook, which conforms to our new non-GAAP metrics. Further details, as well as a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial outlook to GAAP, are contained in our press release and on our website.", "Starting with the fiscal second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue to range from $375 million to $425 million, which is benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of approximately $8 million. We expect total non-GAAP cost of goods sold to range from $162 million to $181 million, which is being reduced by a change in deferred cost of goods sold of approximately $15 million.", "Total non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to range from $160 million to $175 million. This is an increase from the prior year due primarily to higher marketing expense from Mafia III and our other upcoming titles \u2013 releases.", "We expect non-GAAP net income to range from $39 million to $51 million or $0.35 to $0.45 per share and to benefit from a net effect from deferral of net revenue and related cost of goods sold of approximately $17 million. We expect total bookings to range from $350 million to $400 million. The largest contributors to bookings are expected to be NBA 2K17, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, XCOM 2 and BioShock: The Collection.", "Turning to our fiscal 2017 full-year outlook, we now expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion, which is benefiting from a change in deferred net revenue of approximately $200 million. We now expect total non-GAAP cost of goods sold to range from $842 million to $868 million, which is being increased by a change in deferred cost of goods sold of approximately $45 million.", "Total non-GAAP operating expenses are now expected to range from $606 million to $636 million. This increase from the prior year is driven primarily by higher marketing expense for our fiscal 2017 release slate, as well as our lineup for fiscal 2018, along with higher research and development expense, increased personnel expense from a higher head count at our development studios, and increased depreciation expense.", "We now expect non-GAAP net income to range from $229 million to $258 million or $2.00 to $2.25 per share and to benefit from a net effect from deferral of net revenue and related cost of goods sold of approximately $118 million.", "We expect our operations to generate a modest amount of cash flow in fiscal 2017. As calculated pursuant to our prior non-GAAP measures, our fiscal 2017 outlook would have included non-GAAP net revenue of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, which is based on GAAP net revenue of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion, excluding the $200 million benefit from the change in deferred net revenue, and non-GAAP net income per share of $1.00 to $1.25, which is based on our new presentation of non-GAAP net income of $229 million to $258 million or $2.00 to $2.25 per share, excluding the $118 million benefit from the net effects from deferral of net revenue and related cost of goods sold.", "This represents an increase of approximately $50 million versus our previous non-GAAP net revenue outlook, which was a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, and is unchanged versus our previous non-GAAP net income per share outlook, which was based on our prior non-GAAP measures.", "Turning to bookings, we expect total bookings to range from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. Our bookings are expected to be roughly unchanged as compared with last year, driven primarily by our assumption that our new launches and expected growth from NBA 2K and WWE 2K will be offset by moderating results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. The largest contributors to bookings are expected to be NBA 2K17 and NBA 2K16, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Mafia III, WWE 2K17, Sid Meier's Civilization VI, and Battleborn.", "Given our better than expected bookings from recurrent consumer spending in the first quarter and increased expectations for the remainder of the year, we now expect digitally delivered bookings and recurrent consumer spending bookings to be approximately flat versus last year.", "We expect the bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 75% 2K and 25% Rockstar Games. We expect our geographic bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.", "In closing, fiscal 2017 is off to a solid start, and we expect to deliver another year of strong results. With our industry-leading creative assets, coupled with sound financial discipline, Take-Two is well positioned to benefit from the positive, secular trends in our industry and to deliver growth and margin expansion over the long-term. Thank you. Now I will turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank our colleagues for delivering a strong start to the fiscal year, and to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We will now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I've got two questions for you. First, just related to the full-year guidance \u2013 maybe, Lainie, you can help me \u2013 did you say the old guidance of $1.00 to $1.20 is equal to the new guidance of $2.00 to $2.25, and can you help me get to reconcile that? And then secondly, with regards to Mafia III, it seems like you did get some good buzz out of E3. Amazon had it as the number three most anticipated game of games that were shown at E3 and I'm just curious how that, how E3 maybe has changed or caused you to adjust maybe some of your expectations for the game?", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Eric, let me start with the guidance for next year. So the $2.00 to $2.25 is based on the new non-GAAP metrics, and that is what we will be using going forward. So that compares to the $1.00 to $1.25 that we gave out on our last call. And the sales is up slightly, and that's driven by our Q1 results and our increased recurrent consumer spending and that's offset by some additional marketing expense in the year.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Right. But how do I \u2013 and maybe I have just got to spend more time with the press release, but how do I reconcile \u2013 like what do I need to do in my model so that the $2.25 becomes $1.00 to $1.20?", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "If you take a look at the press release, you will see where we broke out what the deferred revenues are, the deferred cost of goods sold, and then what that impact is on the net income and that will help you reconcile it.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Okay.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And, Eric, if you have follow-up questions, you can give Hank or Lainie a call. We'll be happy to go through it, and that would be true for anyone else us on the call as well. And, this is Strauss. On Mafia III at E3, yes, we had a great show. We're really excited about it. We are really proud of the way we showed off the title, and what can I say? Something like 60 awards and -- 60 accolades and 12 awards and enormous buzz, lots of press, and that's one of the things -- one of the many things that E3 is good for. So this is a title that we've put a lot of investment in and in terms of development and marketing, both current and upcoming, and we have high hopes for it. So stay tuned.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.", "Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Close enough. Congratulations, guys, on another good quarter. Few questions here. One, so Lainie, if I just heard you correctly, the no upside on EPS, is that essentially all driven by increased marketing spend, or is there just an increased level of conservatism for any other reason?", "And then to Strauss, post E3, any change to the way you are going to market with Mafia? Was there anything that you saw that made you say, we would want to come at it in a different way?", "And then, also on marketing, I just happened to notice sort of seeing these in different ways, the marketing for GTA Online on Facebook and Instagram and some other areas -- it seems to be doing a pretty good job. Do you think that's -- that marketing has been particularly successful, and do you expect you will be increasing that for GTA Online and possibly for other future additional add-on content? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Let me address, first, on the guidance for fiscal year 2017. So we did keep the bottom-line the same as we said, and the revenue is higher, and that is being offset by the marketing expenses. In terms of conservatism, it's still pretty early in the year. We have several titles, still to be released, including Mafia III, NBA, WWE and Civilization VI. So it's still early in the year. We are pleased with the first quarter, and we'll have to see how the rest of the year pans out for us.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, then in terms of Mafia III coming out of the show, I think we were highly optimistic going into the show and, if anything, more so after the show. We already have a very significant marketing budget against the title as we do for all of our AAA releases, but we do try to structure our marketing budgets flexibly. So, as we learn more, we can adjust them. But I think it's safe to say that we are really stepping up and getting behind this title because we really believe in it.", "To your point on GTA Online and other releases, you're obviously very expert in these matters. And you and I have talked about them. But we, like our competitors, are trying hard to be expert in reaching the consumer wherever the consumer is. And social media is a great way to do that, but you do have to be very expert in the area. And I think we are increasing that expertise at the company broadly and at both of our labels, and you're seeing that in our results.", "So what drives the results of any given title, GTA Online included, is how it speaks to consumers. And it's the creativity in the title and the extraordinary experience of that game and that experience that has drived record results in the quarter. We said we expected results to moderate and they haven't, we had record results again.", "And, certainly, marketing plays a role in that. But at the end of the day, of course, the product itself is what speaks to the consumer, and the marketing is getting that message out. It's our job to do A-plus work with both. And I think, around here, we always feel like we can do more. But, yes, I think, we have made some progress in social media marketing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim O'Shea of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Timothy Larkin O'Shea - Jefferies LLC", "Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So, obviously, you guys have had a lot of success developing new franchises over the past few years. But more recently, it seems like new IP like Battleborn are seeing greater challenges at launch.", "So the question is \u2013 now that you have 9 or 10 large franchises, does this start to make sense to prioritize investment towards that existing IP instead of trying to launch new franchises? I do appreciate Strauss's comments about the importance of creativity and maybe not how everything works out, but I'm just curious how you think about this and whether your thinking has evolved over time. Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Tim, it's a fair question. And I think one has to be careful with the success we've had, because we've launched at least one new hit IP every year \u2013 nearly every year since 2007 \u2013 not every year but nearly every year.", "And, obviously, that's why we have titles like Red Dead and titles like Borderlands and BioShock and, more recently, why we were able to add WWE to the mix because of that willingness, that openness and, frankly, our risk profile. And we are capitalized now to take on that risk.", "So tempting as it may be to rest on our laurels, and we do have 11 franchises that have each sold over 5 million units in individual release. There is something like 60 that have sold, I think, 2 million units at least \u2013 and 60 releases that have sold at least 2 million units. It's tempting to do that. But of course, at the end of the day, you run the risk that the enterprise doesn't grow in that circumstance.", "So while one definitely has a reduced risk profile, when you put out a sequel versus new IP, I think, it's both our obligation and our opportunity to do both. How we do that is an open question. And there are opportunities to moderate risk in so doing. And, also, the world allows you now \u2013 the world of interactive entertainment allows you now to have more than one bite at the apple.", "So with regard to Battleborn, we're being very frank about where we are, because we're a transparent company. We're still delivering new content to Battleborn. Audiences love Battleborn. We still have virtual currency coming for Battleborn. We're not counting it out for a minute. We're just telling you where we're at now. And equally, we just launched Evolve Stage 2, which is another way to express the IP of Evolve. And we've had over 1 million people sign up to play Evolve Stage 2, and that's super exciting.", "So the world has changed. It's unforgiving in that we invest a lot of money in new IP. It's much more forgiving in that we can have consumers be part of our release. We can iterate with them. We can come back and play another day. And if your watchword is quality, there are great opportunities. Say what you will, the consumers actually really have said great things about Battleborn, as have the critics.", "So we're still encouraged by our approach to bringing back beloved sequels while creating new intellectual property. And we do have to be careful, of course, to balance our investment and our risk with the opportunity. And there is a little bit of science in there, a little bit of art in there, but that's one of the things we do every day.", "Timothy Larkin O'Shea - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you, Strauss. I appreciate the comments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Goodman of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.", "Ryan Goodman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Hey there. Thank you for taking the question. I had one on the new bookings metric. So if I look at the quarter, the bookings were down quite a bit year-over-year just because of the GTA V comp, which makes sense.", "So, I guess, two questions. If the annual outlook implies flattish, I believe, was in the comments, what does the September outlook for $350 million to $400 million imply on a year-over-year basis? And how should we expect the year-over-year trend to change over the course of the year? What are the key drivers there?", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "Can you repeat that question? I'm not sure I'm understanding.", "Ryan Goodman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Sure. I'm just looking \u2013 I want to make sure I'm understanding the metrics right. But I see like bookings for this quarter were $253 million, and I believe that was down 25% to 30% year-over-year because of the GTA V comps.", "And I thought in the prepared comments that the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion was flattish year-over-year. So I'm just trying to understand how we get from down 30% to there. What happens between here and there over the next few quarters?", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "So, yes, it is flattish from this year to last year. And it's driven by our release schedule that we have coming up for the rest of the year. We have Mafia III coming out, NBA, WWE, we have Civilization VI and some other titles. So we have a very heavily weighted fall season. That should \u2013 that would make up the difference for the year.", "Ryan Goodman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "I guess, just for a historical perspective, for next quarter, $350 million to $400 million, if you hit the mid-point of that, can you share what the year-over-year comp would be?", "Lainie Goldstein - Chief Financial Officer", "I don't have that in front of me. But if you follow up with us after the call, we could get that to you.", "Ryan Goodman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Okay. That's all I got. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of San Phan of Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.", "San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hi. This is San in for Neil. I was just curious to see if you expect to see an impact to recurring digital spend in the quarter from the Olympics? And there is a gap before NBA 2K17 comes out, but do you expect any impact to that launch as well?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Honestly, if the political season hasn't taken away activity, I certainly don't think the Olympics will. Consumers really love what we have to offer. And when consumers love entertainment, they consume a whole lot of it. It does not appear to be substitutable. So, no, exciting as the Olympics may be, I don't think it will affect us even in the smallest way.", "San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time during the audio portion of the conference. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We would just like to thank everyone for joining us today. We had a good solid quarter and a great start for the year. We've revised our revenue outlook up. We're highly optimistic about what will be one of our strongest fall and holiday release schedules ever. And we want to thank all of our shareholders for their continued support.", "Operator", "This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Thank you. Mr. Diamond, you may begin.", "Henry A. Diamond - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Good afternoon. Welcome and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 ended December 31, 2016. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer.

Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Take-Two had a highly successful holiday quarter. Consumer demand for our new releases and catalog was strong throughout the period and players continue to engage significantly with our games after purchase. As a result, we delivered better-than-expected bookings, including our best ever quarter for recurrent consumer spending, along with double-digit growth in both net revenue and net cash provided by operating activities.", "As of December 31, 2016, we had over $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online continue to outperform our expectations as they have in every quarter since their release. Grand Theft Auto V remains the highest rated game of the current console generation and a must-have title for gamers on both console and PC with sell-in now surpassing 75 million units.", "According to data from the NPD Group that combines physical sales and full game downloads, Grand Theft Auto V was the number six selling game across all platforms in 2016. In addition, Grand Theft Auto Online continues to deliver growth in both engagement and bookings with a record number of players in December, driven by the ongoing release of new content.", "During the third quarter, Rockstar Games supported Grand Theft Auto Online with four significant updates, Bikers, Deadline, Import/Export, and Festive Surprise 2016, and has many more planned going forward. The sustained performance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online is a remarkable achievement and a testimony to Rockstar Games' tireless commitment to excellence, especially since these titles initially launched more than three years ago.", "On October 7, 2K launched Mafia III. Developed by 2K's newest studio, Hangar 13, Mafia III received critical praise for its deep storytelling and authentic period setting. The title achieved the highest first week sell-in of any game in 2K's history and was a popular choice for consumers during the holiday season. To-date, Mafia III has sold-in approximately 5 million units.", "2K and Hangar 13 have continued to support Mafia III with numerous free content offerings, including character clothing, vehicle customization, racing challenges and more. The team is currently working on three exciting downloadable story expansions that will be released this year which can be purchased individually or as part of the Mafia III Season Pass.", "NBA 2K17 delivered growth during the holiday season and continues to delight both new and longtime fans of our industry-leading basketball series. Launched in September, NBA 2K17 is the highest-rated sports title of the current console generation and the highest-rated title in the history of the series, based on average Metacritic score. Today, NBA 2K17 has sold-in nearly 7 million units, up approximately 10% over last year's release and is poised to become our highest selling sports title ever.", "Engagement with the brand continues to grow with consumers already playing more than 1 billion games of NBA 2K17, up 27% over last year. More than half of these were multiplayer which increased 61%. This strong engagement with both NBA 2K17 and the MyNBA2K companion app drove record bookings from recurrent consumer spending for the series, which grew 56% in the third quarter. In addition, 2K and Visual Concepts continue to expand the brand's reach through emerging platforms and business models.", "In November, 2K released the NBA 2K VR Experience which provides the first virtual reality basketball game that immerses players in a new NBA environment filled with many games and challenges. And in December, 2K commenced its second NBA 2K eSports tournament that will culminate this weekend during the NBA All-Star 2017 with the final teams competing for the championship prize of $250,000 plus tickets to the NBA All-Star game in New Orleans.", "We're thrilled to expand our footprint in the evolving world of eSports and look forward to continuing to blaze the trail in competitive sports gaming with NBA 2K. On October 11, 2K successfully released WWE 2K17, the latest annual installment in our popular sports entertainment series that is developed collaboratively by Yuke's and Visual Concepts. And today, 2K further expanded the audience for the title with its release for PC.", "WWE 2K17 is being supported with a variety of downloadable add-on content, including a Season Pass. We believe there remains a substantial long-term growth opportunity for the WWE 2K series by further leveraging the development and marketing expertise of 2K and Visual Concepts which are responsible for the tremendous success of NBA 2K.", "On October 21, 2K launched Sid Meier's Civilization VI, the latest offering from our award-winning turn-based strategy series that has sold-in nearly 40 million units worldwide. Civilization VI received stellar reviews and is the fastest selling title in the history of the series, with sell-in already surpassing 1.5 million units.", "2K is supporting Civilization VI with a rich array of additional content and already has released 2K downloadable add-on content packs as well as a variety of free content for the title. Later this month, Sid Meier will be honored at the Entertainment Software Association's annual gala in San Francisco, celebrating his legendary career and contributions to our industry and art form.", "During the third quarter, we delivered record digitally-delivered bookings, driven by growth in both full game downloads and recurrent consumer spending. We continue to benefit as consumers buy a growing percentage of games through digital download. And, for the current fiscal year, we're seeing more than 25% of our current generation console titles purchased digitally.", "More importantly, recurrent consumer spending grew 55% to its highest level ever and accounted for 50% of digitally-delivered bookings or 23% of total bookings in the third quarter. In addition to virtual currency for Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings.", "In the free-to-play category, WWE SuperCard delivered its best quarter ever with bookings nearly doubling and total downloads for the title now exceeding 13 million. During the third quarter, we released a season three update that significantly enhanced this popular card game. In addition, NBA 2K Online grew bookings and remains the number one PC online sports game in China with 34 million registered users. And bookings from downloadable add-on content also grew, led by offerings for Sid Meier's Civilization, WWE 2K17, XCOM 2, and Battleborn.", "Last week, we announced a key strategic acquisition for our organization, reflecting our strategy to deploy our capital resources prudently and to take measured risks that provide immediately accretive opportunities for our business and the potential to long-term growth. We acquired Social Point, a highly successful free-to-play mobile game developer based in Barcelona.", "With this acquisition, we further diversified our business, expanded our portfolio of owned intellectual property and significantly enhanced our position in the fast-growing free-to-play mobile gaming space, which is the world's highest grossing gaming segment with revenues in excess of $40 billion in 2016, according to IDG estimates. The experienced team at Social Point shares our commitment to delighting consumers with high-quality entertainment. And we believe that Social Point's deeply engaging mobile offerings will be a perfect complement to our business.", "Moreover, Social Point is one of the few mobile game developers that has a proven track record of growing revenues and delivering multiple hits. Since 2014, Social Point has been one of only six mobile publishers to have at least two games consistently in the top 100 grossing mobile games in the U.S. We're thrilled to have the team at Social Point join our organization.", "Looking ahead, fiscal 2018 promises to be another growth year for both bookings and cash flow, driven by a release slate led by Rockstar Games' eagerly anticipated launch of Red Dead Redemption 2. While interactive entertainment has captivated audiences for more than 40 years, we're only just beginning to see the vast potential of today's most immersive and dynamic art form.", "Our ability to engage audiences around the world across a myriad of experiences and platforms has never been greater and continues to evolve and shape the way that we create and deliver our entertainment offerings. Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities, strategically, creatively, and financially, and to deliver returns to our shareholders over the long-term.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by congratulating our teams on delivering a strong holiday quarter. Our consistent ability to release high-quality, engaging entertainment experiences across multiple platforms and distribution channels is both the distinguishing characteristic of our organization and a key driver of our success. Creativity and innovation are among Take-Two's core tenets and those principles inform and inspire our work on a daily basis.", "As we continue to diversify our business, we aim to broaden our portfolio with offerings that captivate and engage players in new and exciting ways. To that end, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Social Point to Take-Two. Social Point's three co-founders, Andr\u00e9s Bou, Horacio Martos, and Marc Canaleta, have worked together for over six years and its senior leadership team has an aggregate of nearly 100 years of experience in the mobile games business. Like Take-Two, Social Point produces high quality entertainment that can attract and retain a loyal, highly engaged player base and deliver sustainable results.", "Social Point focuses on mid-core games that have greater game play depths than casual games. And the company's titles typically monetize and retain players at higher rates than its competitors in the segment. Social Point currently has multiple profitable games in the market. Its two most successful games, Dragon City and Monster Legends, have been downloaded more than 180 million times.", "Dragon City launched on mobile in 2013 and is a simulation game involving breeding, building and battling, in which players create, expand their city and can collect more than 500 unique dragons. The title consistently has been among the top 100 grossing mobile games and top 20 grossing simulation games in the United States. Monster Legends also launched in 2013 and is an RPG involving breeding, building and battling with nearly 400 monsters. The title consistently has been among the top 75 grossing mobile games and top 15 grossing RPGs in the U.S.", "Social Point also has strong growth prospects. The company has a number of exciting games planned for launch over the next two years. Furthermore, its current titles have not yet been released in Asia which is the world's largest mobile games market and represents an additional growth opportunity. In addition to strong mobile IP, Social Point brings an experienced data analytics team and a cutting-edge, proprietary data analytics platform that are built internally.", "This custom platform enables Social Point to optimize revenues and profits by predicting user actions, future monetization and lifetime customer value, based on historical data and behavior patterns within hours of acquiring a user. Social Point will operate as a new division within Take-Two and will continue to be based in Barcelona, Spain. We look forward to working with the team at Social Point and to expanding our presence in the free-to-play mobile market.", "Turning to Take-Two's frontline releases, 2K today launched WWE 2K17 for PC and we will have additional add-on content offerings for our recent releases, including Mafia III, during the fourth quarter. Last month, 2K announced that it will release NBA 2K18 for the Nintendo Switch when the title launches this fall on console and PC.", "NBA 2K18 will be our first offering for the Switch and we're pleased to support Nintendo's new platform and to expand the audience for our industry-leading brands. Looking ahead, we have a robust long-term development pipeline and our creative teams across both of our labels will continue to explore new and innovative ways to drive engagement with our titles and growth in recurrent consumer spending.", "I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss fiscal third quarter results, share some details regarding our acquisition of Social Point and then review our financial outlook for the remainder of the year.", "As mentioned by Strauss and Karl, Take-Two had a strong holiday quarter. Sales of our offerings significantly exceeded our expectations with total bookings growing 51% to $719 million. Of this amount, 47% were digitally-delivered bookings, which grew 66% to $336.3 million, a new record. The upside to total bookings was driven primarily by the better-than-expected performance of Grand Theft Auto V as well as recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K17.", "Our better-than-expected bookings converted into strong net cash provided by operating activities which grew 72% to $291 million. We deployed $6.1 million in capital expenditures. And, as of December 31, our cash and short-term investment balance was $1.44 billion. While the performance of our business exceeded our expectations, as reflected in our strong bookings and cash flow growth, this outperformance is not reflected in our GAAP net revenue and net loss, primarily for three reasons.", "First, our bookings outperformance was driven by titles that we are required to defer. And, therefore, our revenues and profits won't benefit from these bookings until future period. Second, because of the better-than-expected performance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, we recorded higher than forecasted internal royalties which are calculated using results that are adjusted to exclude the impact of deferral and unlike certain other cost of goods sold are not deferred.", "And third, during the third quarter, we recognized higher development costs for Mafia III than forecasted due to timing. These costs will be offset by lower development costs in the fourth quarter. Turning to some details from our third quarter income statement, net revenue grew by 15% to $476.5 million. Growth was driven primarily by the launch of Sid Meier's Civilization VI and the recognition of previously deferred revenues from Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K.", "Net revenue was reduced by a $268.3 million change in deferred net revenue. This change was driven primarily by Mafia III which is being deferred into the fourth quarter as a result of announced free additional content that was not released until the fourth quarter. The change in deferred net revenue was higher than our forecast due to the better-than-expected performance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online.", "Digitally-delivered net revenue grew 64% to $240.2 million and was reduced by $117.2 million change in deferred net revenue. Cost of goods sold increased by 21% to $311.1 million, driven primarily by development costs related to our third quarter releases, as well as higher internal royalties. Cost of goods sold was reduced by $118.1 million change in deferred cost of goods sold and included $6 million in stock-based compensation.", "Operating expenses decreased by 10% to $193.8 million, due primarily to the absence of business reorganization cost the quarter last year, partially offset by higher marketing expense to support our extensive holiday release slate. Operating expenses included $16.1 million in stock-based compensation and $300,000 in acquisition related expense.", "And net loss was $29.8 million or $0.33 per share which included the following pre-tax items that we use internally, along with our management reporting tax rate of 22% to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance: a $150.2 million reduction from the net effect from deferral of net revenue and related cost of goods sold, $22.1 million of stock-based compensation, $300,000 in acquisition-related expense, and $4.9 million in amortization of convertible notes.", "Note that since we reported a GAAP loss, our net loss per share was calculated using a basic share count of 90.4 million. For management reporting purposes, we calculate diluted net income per share using our fully diluted share count of 115.3 million and we add back to net income interest expense on our convertible notes net of tax of $1.2 million.", "On January 31, Take-Two further diversified its business through the acquisition of Social Point. We acquired the company for $250 million comprised of $175 million in cash and approximately 1.48 million shares of our common stock. The cash portion was paid using our offshore cash on hand. Following the transaction, approximately 90% of our cash and short-term investments is now held in the U.S.", "The three founders of Social Point are also eligible to receive earn-out consideration of up to an aggregate of $25.9 million contingent on the business delivering substantial EBITDA growth over the next two year. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to net revenue and net cash provided by operating activities and to be accretive to net income per share, excluding transaction costs and amortization of intangible assets, in fiscal 2018.", "Social Point's high quality, deeply engaging mobile offerings are expected to provide consistent revenue from recurrent consumer spending throughout the year, which will meaningfully enhance and further diversify our existing revenues from recurrent consumer spending and help to continue to mitigate the variability of our results.", "During the past three calendar years, Social Point's net revenue has experienced minimal seasonality and exceeded $20 million in all four quarters of calendar 2016. The company has been consistently profitable since 2013 with EBITDA margins of approximately 20%, including net revenue at a 29% CAGR from 2013 to 2016.", "For the trailing 12 months ended December 31, Social Point generated net revenue of $90.8 million and EBITDA of $19.9 million. Given this exciting development pipeline, we expect Social Point's business to continue to grow in fiscal 2018 and beyond.", "I'd like to join Strauss and Karl in welcoming the team at Social Point to our organization and also thank the team at Take-Two for all of their hard work in successfully completing this transaction. Now I will review the highlights of our financial outlook. Further details are contained in our press release.", "Starting with the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect total bookings to range from $295 million to $345 million. The largest contributors are expected to be NBA 2K17, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, WWE 2K17, Civilization VI, and Mafia III. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $542 million to $592 million. Net revenue is expected to be increased by a $225 million change in deferred net revenue due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred revenues from Mafia III.", "We expect cost of goods sold to range from $248 million to $278 million, which is expected to be increased by $120 million change in deferred cost of goods sold and includes $3 million of amortization of intangible assets and $1 million of stock-based compensation.", "Operating expenses are expected to range from $140 million to $150 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 18% increase over the previous year due, primarily to higher professional fees and stock-based compensation. Operating expenses includes $17 million of stock-based compensation, $2 million of amortization of intangible assets, and $1 million of acquisition-related costs.", "And we expect GAAP net income to range from $139 million to $148 million or $1.23 to $1.31 per share, which includes the following pre-tax items that we use internally along with our management reporting tax rate of 22% to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance: a $105 million increase from the net effect from deferral of net revenue and related cost of goods sold, $18 million of stock-based compensation, $5 million of amortization of intangible assets, $1 million in acquisition-related expense, and $3 million in amortization of convertible notes.", "Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. As a result of our better-than-expected third quarter bookings and strong outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising the midpoint of our bookings outlook by $100 million. We now expect total bookings to grow by 16% at the midpoint of our outlook and to range from $1.72 billion to $1.77 billion.", "In addition, we now expect digitally-delivered bookings to grow by around 20%, driven by growth in both the current consumer spending and full game downloads as we now expect Grand Theft Auto Online to be up for the full fiscal year. The largest contributors are expected to be NBA 2K17 and NBA 2K16, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, Mafia III, WWE 2K17, and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.", "We expect the bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 65% 2K and 35% Rockstar Games. And we expect the geographic bookings to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect to generate net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $350 million, up about 34% over last year. And we plan to deploy approximately $35 million for capital expenditures.", "Our increased outlook for bookings does not translate into a higher forecast for GAAP net revenues because most of the increase is being driven by sales of titles that we are required to defer. In addition, GAAP net income is impacted by higher internal royalties resulting from the continued outperformance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online.", "We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion, which is expected to be reduced by a $65 million change in deferred net revenue. We expect cost of goods sold to range from $956 million to $986 million which includes no change in deferred cost of goods sold, $17 million in stock-based compensation and $3 million of amortization of intangible assets.", "Total operating expenses are expected to range from $660 million to $670 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase over the prior year, driven primarily by marketing expenses for our fiscal 2017 and 2018 release slates as well as higher R&D expense and professional fees, partially offset by the absence of a business reorganization charge recorded last year. Operating expenses include $57 million of stock-based compensation, $2 million of amortization of intangible assets and $1.5 million of acquisition-related expenses.", "We expect net income to range from $108 million to $117 million or $1.15 to $1.25 per share, which includes the following pre-tax items that we use internally along with our management reporting tax rate of 22% to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance: a $65 million reduction from the net effect of deferral of net revenue and related cost of goods sold, $74 million of stock-based compensation, $5 million of amortization of intangible assets, $1.5 million in acquisition-related expense, a $2 million gain on long-term investment, and $21 million in amortization of convertible notes.", "As we enter the final months of fiscal 2017, Take-Two is more diversified and better positioned for long-term success than at any time in our company's history. Our results to-date have been achieved through our creative leadership, innovation, and disciplined focus on operational excellence. Going forward, we will strive to further broaden the way that we entertain and engage with our audiences and to generate growth and margin expansion for our shareholders.", "Thank you. Now, I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another strong quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question, Ben.", "Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "On continued execution, a few questions. One, can you remind us what the unit sales were for the previous Red Dead in its first year and how you're thinking about the potential for the next iteration in FY 2018? And then, Lainie, in the past, you had said that OpEx should increase this fiscal year for some promotional activity for next year. Have we seen that or should we expect anything in the next couple of months? And then finally on Social Point, how should we be thinking about that, how that may impact Rockstar or 2K's mobile offerings over time? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Hey, Ben. Thank you. The first year for Red Dead, the last release was 8.5 million units and lifetime to-date is around 15 million units. We're not talking about our expectations except obviously we're incredibly excited about the title, not just Red Dead, also the online offerings to come. So Rockstar, we'll talk more about the title but obviously there's a great anticipation both on the part of ourselves and consumers. Lainie is going to talk about your second question.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Sure. For marketing spend for the year, we did talk at the beginning of the year that it would be up for the whole year to support our fiscal 2017 titles and also some of our fiscal 2018 titles. So we've seen that throughout the year and we'll continue to see that through Q4.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "And then, with regards Social Point, look, we acquired Social Point because we see it as a strong stand-alone company that's expert in the mobile and free-to-play market. And they have owned intellectual property in a multiplicity of hits and they know how to engage with consumers and then to monetize that engagement. We want them to keep doing what they're doing and keep growing the business. We obviously have high expectations. We love the fact that the deal was accretive to bookings and to cash flow from operations immediately and expect it to be accretive to net income in fiscal 2018 without regard to amortization and transaction cost.", "In terms of potential engagement with the other labels, it's too early to say. One of the things that we pride ourselves on is that our enterprise is comprised of creatively independent entities, where people can pursue their \u2013 not only can, but are encouraged to pursue their passion. We all work together collectively, but the cooperation that occurs will be organic. It won't be driven by the center.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Question. Two questions for you. First with regards to fiscal 2018, I think, at the beginning of the year, you talked about the release slate for fiscal 2018 being one that's more normalized than what we've seen in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016, which would seem to suggest we'll get a couple 2K studio titles to still be announced. Is that still the case that it will be a \"normalized\" release type of year? And then, secondly with the Social Point acquisition, you did include some stock in there. Is there any particular reason why you didn't do an all-cash deal and why you included some stock?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks, Eric. So, in terms of our comments which have been limited about fiscal 2018, I think, the only thing that we've said or at least recall saying is that we expect to see growth in bookings and cash flow and always said about the release schedule so far is, of course, reflecting Rockstar's announcement about Red Dead Redemption 2 and the fact that we expect to have our normal annual releases. And then, of course, you would expect to see our recurrent consumer spending opportunities in catalog sales, but we haven't talked about anything else yet. And in terms of Social Point, the idea of making sure some of the consideration was in stock is to align interest, to make sure that the principals of Social Point have a stake in our enterprise and as the enterprise continues to perform they benefit from that and to make sure that all of our interest are aligned.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question, Mike.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Great quarter. Congratulations. Curious about GTA Online. It continues to grow. And looks like a big piece of that is the content that continues to come into the game. And so, as much as you can, Strauss, I was sort of curious if we can expect a similar level of content moving forward. And looks like there's also a fair amount of player created content. I'm curious how that's contributing to the growth overall of that digital piece of your business.", "And the second question, wondering as you sort of ramp into the release of Red Dead, if you feel that GTA and Red Dead can sort of co-exist or find a harmony or if anything there is a net positive. I guess sort of intuitive that perhaps Red Dead might disrupt a little bit the GTA Online player base given that there's probably some overlap in players. Thanks, guys.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Hey, Mike. Thanks. So, we obviously believe continued engagement with GTA Online is driven at least partially by the ongoing content creation which people love. And Rockstar said they'll continue to support GTA Online with more content to come and anything more specific, of course, will come in due time from Rockstar. I don't really have a point of view on player created content to share.", "And on Red Dead, I'm fond of saying entertainment is an unusual animal. And that entertainment properties don't really compete with other entertainment properties and that you never need entertainment. Entertainment is something that you want to have, but it's not a need to have. If nothing in the market appeals to you at some time, there's no reason to go and get it. And if multiple things appeal to you, avid consumers will consume all of those things.", "So, I don't think there's any competitive dynamic with any of our upcoming releases apart from the fact that our success is driven by quality. So, I think, the success of Red Dead, which is highly anticipated, will be driven by its quality. And I think the ongoing success of Grand Theft Auto Online is driven by its extraordinary quality.", "Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Thanks, Strauss.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Thank you. Based on what you said and one of your competitors who has already reported said, it does feel like the consumer adoption of digital full game downloads is moving along at a pretty rapid pace. Is that creating any pressure in the retail channel? Are you seeing any pushback? Does it cause any concerns on your part of that that disruption may be coming? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "The channel remains healthy. Our primary source of distribution remains physical distribution. It's 75% of our new generation console sales. But you're right, digital distribution is growing at the benefit to consumers. And we actually do derive a gross margin benefit from it and we can't deny that. But retail remains a very important partner. That hasn't changed. And we don't expect that to change anytime soon.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tim O'Shea of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah. So, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Strauss, you touched on the brand-new online multiplayer experience for Red Dead 2. So, I was just hoping you might expand on that, what it might entail. And should we think about this as being analogous to GTA Online or maybe something else?", "And then quickly second, what kind of marketing support should we expect for Red Dead 2? The reason I ask is because looking back when you announced Red Dead back in October, it kind of seems like you set the gaming world on fire and all it took was basically one tweet and one image added to Rockstar's website. So, just curious if you think you can drive any leverage using various online tools and social platforms. Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So, in terms of the online experience, Rockstar will announce more in due time. And that's not something we typically talk about on these calls except to say that we're really excited about what is to come. In terms of marketing support, look, we support all of our releases very significantly. We're incredibly proud of our marketing teams throughout the company. And our support is quite significant for all of our releases. Social media is a big part of our marketing plans today. Digital media is a big part of all of our marketing plans today. Outdoor remains a big part of our plans. So I think you should expect to see with regard to all of our releases very significant marketing support.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of San Phan of Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.", "San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Just on your previous comments regarding mobile, was there anything in particular that basically maybe helped evolve your perspective on the mobile opportunity for Take-Two when you decided to acquire Social Point? And then second question was just hoping to get your latest thoughts on Nintendo Switch and whether we could expect to see exclusive titles in the platform or just ports of planned releases like NBA Live for now. Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So, our perspective on mobile hasn't changed at all. We're aware of the size of the business, it's a $40 billion market. And we found it exciting and we are relatively significant participants in mobile and in free-to-play now through titles like the NBA 2K companion app, WWE SuperCard, and other forms of supporting our titles that are reflected in recurrent consumer spending. We had a record quarter for bookings related to recurrent consumer spending. So obviously it's an important part of our strategy.", "What we love about Social Point is it addressed the exact criteria we were looking for in an acquisition in the space in that they owned their intellectual property; in that they have a track record of creating multiple hits, not just one hit, in that they have real scale; in that they're profitable; and in that their team has a great culture and a culture that fits well with ours we believe.", "We were also looking for an acquisition that would be immediately accretive to bookings and to cash flow from operations, and this one will be. So, our thinking hasn't changed. What changed with the announcement of Social Point was an opportunity to bring a company into our enterprise that meets all of the criteria we were seeking. And that's what makes it so exciting.", "With regard to Switch, we're excited about Switch. We're supporting Switch with NBA 2K18. We've said we're supporting the platform. I've said over and over again that when Nintendo comes to market you never want to count them out. So, we're excited about it. The only thing we've announced so far is the basketball title.", "San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time over the audio portion of the conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "On behalf of all of our colleagues and our entire management team, we want to thank you for joining us today. Thanks for our shareholders. Mostly thanks to the people at this company all over the world, many of whom are listening now, for their incredible contributions, their great creative work, the passion with which they pursue their jobs, the great job they do at marketing, at distribution, accounting, cash management, Investor Relations. We all work together here in every part of our business to achieve these results. It's a shared victory and we couldn't be more pleased.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Hank Diamond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Diamond, you may begin", "Henry Diamond", "Good morning. Welcome, and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 ended March 31, 2017. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We've no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Actual operating results may vary significantly from these forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC, including the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form [Audio Gap]", "I'd also like to note that, unless otherwise stated, all numbers we will be discussing today are GAAP, and unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are year-over-year. Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Strauss", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Hank. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, all of us here at Take-Two all around the world want to acknowledge and express our sympathy in the wake of these terrible and tragic attacks in Manchester. It's terribly sad that at an entertainment event, where people went to be pleased and delighted, that this terrible thing occurred, and we're deeply saddened by it, and obviously, puts into context the conversations we're having today.", "So with that said, we'll turn our attention to business. Consumer demand for offerings remained exceedingly strong in the fourth quarter, finishing off another outstanding year for our organization. During fiscal 2017, we delivered bookings that significantly exceeded our expectations, along with revenue growth and margin expansion. These results were driven by the continued extraordinary performance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, a diverse array of titles from 2K and record digitally delivered revenue and bookings, including our highest-ever from recurrent consumer spending.", "Our business performance converted into substantial cash provided by our operating activities, which grew 27% to $331 million. We invested our capital to grow and diversify our business further, including acquiring Social Point, a leading free-to-play mobile game developer. As of March 31, 2017, we had $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our expectations during the fourth quarter as they have in every period since their release. Grand Theft Auto V remains our industry's standard bearer for creative excellence and the highest-rated game of the current console generation, with selling now surpassing 80 million units. The title continues to attract and delight new audiences; especially, the install base of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One expands further. In addition, Grand Theft Auto Online again delivered year-over-year bookings growth in the fourth quarter, substantially exceeding our expectations and was the single largest contributor to recurrent consumer spending. Rockstar Games has driven sustained engagement through the ongoing release of a wide array of three additional content. Most recently, the Cunning Stunts: Special Vehicle Circuit update, followed by the Land Grab and Tiny Racers modes. In total, Rockstar Games released 12 significant updates during fiscal 2017, coupled with a regular weekly schedule of new content offerings and as much more planned going forward. It's a remarkable achievement that recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online has grown every year since its release and reached record levels in fiscal 2017 more than 3 years after its initial launch.", "Our results also benefited from 2K's robust holiday lineup. NBA 2K17 remains the top-rated sports game of the current console generation and is poised to become our highest-selling sports title ever, with selling to date of nearly 8 million units. Engagement with and recurrent consumer spending on our industry-leading basketball series continues to grow, with over 2 billion games of NBA 2K17 played on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, up 16% over NBA 2K16. More than 1.3 billion of these games were multiplayer, a 40% increase, and the average time the consumer spent playing multiplayer games increased by nearly 30%. This remarkably strong engagement helps to drive record recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K, which grew 71% during fiscal 2017. Furthermore, we're thrilled to broaden our industry-leading basketball brand and expand our footprint in the evolving world of competitive gaming, with the upcoming launch of the NBA 2K eSports league, which Karl will discuss in more detail. ", "Mafia III was praised by the media and consumers alike for setting new creative benchmarks through its deep storytelling, diverse characters and authentic period setting. The title's being supported with downloadable content, including a Season Pass that delivers three narrative-focused experiences, which expand the world of New Bordeaux with thrilling new storylines alongside characters, both familiar and new. Mafia III's add-on content also brings fresh new locations to explore gameplay mechanics, weapons, vehicles, outfits and activities. We're proud of Hangar 13's inaugural release, which is now sold in more than 5 million units. ", "WWE 2K17 continued to build on the success of our popular sports entertainment series and is sold in approximately 3 million units today. Developed collaboratively by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, WWE 2K17 is being supported with downloadable add-on content, including a Season Pass. We believe there remains a substantial long-term growth opportunity for the WWE 2K series by further leveraging the development of marketing talent of 2K and Visual Concepts, which are responsible for the tremendous success of NBA 2K. Sid Meier's Civilization received stellar reviews and is the fastest-selling title in the history of the series, with selling to date of nearly 2 million units. The robust post-launch content for Civilization VI includes the Australia Civilization & Scenario Pack and the Persia and Macedon Civilization & Scenario Pack. In addition, 2 more civilization & scenario packs will be added automatically for owners of the Civilization VI - Digital Deluxe edition at no extra cost. ", "We're immensely grateful to Sid and the team at Firaxis Games, who captivated audiences for more than 25 years and continue to raise the bar for this beloved strategy series, which is sold in more than 40 million units worldwide. In addition, a number of other releases within catalog titles contributed to our fiscal 2017 results, including NBA 2K16, BioShock: The Collection and XCOM 2. We continue to benefit from our industry's ongoing transition to digital distribution. In fiscal 2017, we delivered record digitally delivered revenues in bookings, driven by growth in both full-game downloads and recurrent consumer spending. Recurrent consumer spending grew 52% to its highest level ever and accounted for 57% of digitally delivered bookings or nearly 1/3 of total bookings. In addition to record sales of virtual currency for Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings. Starting with the free-to-play category, WWE SuperCard delivered its best year ever, with bookings up more than 70% and total downloads now exceeding 14 million. During fiscal 2017, we released 3 updates for the title that significantly enhanced this popular card game -- card battle game. NBA 2K online, which remains the #1 PC online sports game in China, with approximately 35 million registered users also enjoyed record results, including strong double-digit bookings growth.", "And Social Point, which we acquired in January, already is outperforming our expectations. Bookings from its 2 biggest games, Dragon City and Monster Legends, grew in the fourth quarter, and daily average revenue per user increased nearly 30%. We expect this acquisition to be a significant contributor to recurrent consumer spending in fiscal 2018 and a meaningful growth opportunity over the long term. In the downloadable add-on content category, bookings grew substantially, led by our offerings for Sid Meier's Civilization, WWE 2K and XCOM 2.", "As announced yesterday, Rockstar Games have decided to move the release of Red Dead Redemption through the spring 2018. Red Dead Redemption 2 will be their first game created from the ground up for the latest generational console hardware and some extra time is necessary to ensure the best experience possible. Thus, decisions are not made lightly and are driven by our team's unwavering commitment to unparalleled quality. That said, we still expect fiscal 2018 to be a year of strong earnings and cash provided by our operating activities for Take-Two, despite an unusually light release slate. Our ability to project significant profits with lineup that solely includes new frontline releases of our annual sports entertainment titles reflect the strength of our robust catalog led by Grand Theft Auto and a substantial contribution we now received from recurrent consumer spending. While we still have much opportunity to make our release slate and results more consistent over time, our enterprise has been transformed into a significantly higher margin business than at any time in its history. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we expect to deliver both record net sales and record net cash provided by operating activities led by the launchs of Rockstar Games, Red Dead Redemption 2 and a highly anticipated new title from one of 2K's biggest franchises.", "As the audience for interactive entertainment continues to grow and our industry leverages new technologies, Take-Two is benefiting from these positive trends in numerous ways. Whether a broader canvas on which we can create groundbreaking entertainment or digital distribution channels, new business models and emerging platforms that are expanding the way consumers experience our games, there's never been a more exciting time for our company and our industry. Take-Two is superbly positioned to capitalize on all these opportunities creatively, operationally and financially, and continue to deliver value to our customers and returns for our shareholders over the long term.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff", "Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to begin by congratulating our teams on delivering a very strong fourth quarter and another exceptional year for Take-Two. Our fiscal 2017 results reflect our company's ability to deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences across a variety of genres, platforms and distribution channels. Moreover, we continue to find new and innovative ways to increase our audiences' engagement with our renowned brands. It is our teams' create vision and tireless dedication to excellence that drives our success, and they continue to set new benchmarks for groundbreaking entertainment that captivates players around the world.", "I'll now discuss our recent strategic accomplishment: the formation of the NBA 2K eSports league. The emergence of competitive gaming as a spectator sport represents an incredibly exciting opportunity for both our industry and Take-Two. According to research firm, Newzoo, audience for competitive gaming has grown to over 250 million people, nearly half of which are avid viewers that watch major international events. In addition, the financial opportunity is substantial, as the competitive gaming market is expected to reach 1.1 billion by 2019. While our initial forays into this space were tournaments for NBA 2K16 and 17 that were designed to benefit marketing and the brand, we believe that with a right partner, competitive gaming could be a direct driver of revenues and profits for our company over the long term. To that end, we were thrilled to announce in February an exciting joint venture with the NBA to create and launch the NBA 2K eSports league. This partnership builds upon the success of our NBA 2K brand and relationship with the NBA to bring together the best basketball gamers in the world, marking the first official competitive gaming league that is jointly owned by a U.S. professional of sports league. The NBA 2K eSports league will launch in 2018, and 17 out of the NBA's 30 teams will participate in the inaugural season. Teams will be comprised professional eSports players, who will play NBA 2K as user-generated avatars in a 5-on-5 format. The teams will compete head-to-head throughout a regular season, which will culminate with bracketed playoffs and a championship matchup. We believe that the NBA 2K eSports league has a long-term potential to generate significant revenues and profit through broadcasting rights, ticket sales, pay-per-view events, sponsorships, advertising and merchandise, just like any other professional sports league. We recently announced the appointment of sports industry veteran and NBA executive, Brendan Donohue, as the league Managing Director, and we will have more updates to share about the league's progress in coming months.", "Turning to our fiscal 2018 lineup. 2K and Visual Concepts are hard at work on NBA 2K18, the latest installment of our industry's perennial number 1 rated and number 1 selling basketball series. Earlier this month, 2K announced that 2016 Hall of Famer and 15-time NBA All-Star, Shaquille O'Neal, will be on the cover of this year's Legend Edition and Legend Edition Gold, which will retail for $99 and $149, respectively. NBA 2K18's Legend Editions follow the success of prior special edition and represent the franchise's increased focus on premium consumer offerings, with more virtual currency and digital items bundled together for maximum consumer value. These collections will include special Shaq-themed memorabilia and content, celebrating his legacy as one of the most dominant centers in NBA history. NBA 2K18 will be available on September 19 for PlayStations 4, PlayStations 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch and Windows PC. 2K will have more to share about the title, including announcing the cover athlete for the standard edition in the coming weeks.", "This fall, our popular simulation-based WWE series will return with WWE 2K18, featuring authentic hard-hitting action, fan-favorite game modes, match types, creation capabilities and everything players have come to love from the series. WWE 2K18 looks to bring everyone closer to the in-ring actions than ever before. In addition to our annual sports titles, we will have new downloadable add-on content for our recent frontline releases. Next week, Hangar 13 and 2K will launch Stones Unturned, the second of 3 story-driven add-ons for Mafia III. 2K also will soon reveal more about the third and final expansion Sign of the Times, which is planned to release later this summer. And in the coming months, 2K and Firaxis Games will release 2 additional civilization & scenario packs for Sid Meier's Civilization VI and will introduce 3 new leaders representing civilizations from Africa and Southeast Asia. This content will be available automatically at no extra cost for purchasers of the Civilization VI - Digital Deluxe edition upon their release.", "Social Point is also hard at work on its robust development pipeline and has a number of exciting games planned for launch over the next 2 years. Next month, at E3 in Los Angeles, we'll have a corporate booth on the show floor. We will not be showing any new products, but we will be holding business development, investor relations, media and sales meetings throughout the show. Looking beyond the current fiscal year, we have a strong development pipeline across both of our labels, which include new releases from a popular series, along with groundbreaking new IP. We remain focused on delivering the highest quality titles and supporting them with digitally delivered offerings that provide additional value to consumers as well as drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending. Coupled with our emerging opportunities and competitive gaming, mobile and geographic expansion, our potential for growth over the long term is better than ever.", "I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results and then review our financial outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2018. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and financial outlook are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance. As mentioned by Strauss, our fiscal fourth quarter provided a strong finish to another great year for Take-Two. Sales of our offerings exceeded our expectations due primarily to the continued outperformance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, total bookings growing 14% to $371 million in the fourth quarter. Of this amount, 72% was digitally delivered bookings, which grew 28% to $257 million as we continued to benefit from growth in recurrent consumer spending as well as our industry's ongoing transition to full-game downloads.", "While the performance of our business exceeded our expectations as reflected in our strong bookings and cash flow growth, this outperformance is not reflected in our GAAP results for 2 reasons. First, our bookings outperformance is driven by titles that we have acquired (inaudible), and therefore, our revenues and profits won't benefit from these bookings until future period. And second, because of the better-than-expected performance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, we recorded higher-than-forecasted internal royalties, which are calculated using results that are adjusted to exclude the impact of deferrals and unlike certain other costs of goods sold are not deferred.", "Turning to some details from our fourth quarter income statement. GAAP net revenue grew by 52%, to $572 million, and cost of goods sold increased 50% to $315 million. This growth was driven primarily by the recognition of previously deferred revenues and costs from Mafia III. Operating expenses increased by 18% to $145 million due primarily to higher stock-based compensation, legal and IT expense. And GAAP net income increased by 114% to $99 million, or $0.89 per share. For the full fiscal year, we delivered bookings in cash provided by operating activities that substantially exceeded the original outlook we gave last year. These results were driven primarily by the sustained outperformance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online coupled with better-than-expected sales of NBA 2K and record recurrent consumer spending. Total bookings grew 19% to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by the launches of Mafia III and Sid Meier's Civilization VI, along with growth of bookings from NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online. Of this amount, 55% were digitally delivered bookings, which grew 25% to a new record of $987 million. Our better-than-expected bookings converted into strong net cash provided by operating activities, which grew 27% to $331 million. We spent $21 million in capital expenditures, and we acquired Social Point for $175 million in cash, along with 1.5 million shares of Take-Two common stock. As of March 31, our cash and short-term investments balance was $1.4 billion.", "Turning to some details from our fiscal 2017 income statement. GAAP net revenue and cost of goods sold each grew 26% to $1.78 billion and $1.02 billion, respectively due primarily to the launches of Mafia III and Sid Meier's Civilization VI as well as the recognition of higher revenues and costs from the growth of NBA 2K. Operating expenses increased by 9% to $665 million due primarily to marketing expenses for fiscal 2017 release slate and Red Dead Redemption 2 as well as expense, professional fees and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by the absence of a business reorganization charge recorded in fiscal 2015. And GAAP net income increased to $67 million, or $0.72 per share, up from a net loss of $8 million, or $0.10 per share. As noted in our press release, starting with our financial outlook and results for fiscal first quarter 2018, we are replacing bookings with net sales as an operational metric. The company is making this change in order to increase transparency and to be consistent with the operational metrics provided by our peers. Net sales is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold physically during the period. Unlike bookings, net sales includes licensing fees, merchandise, in-game advertising strategy guides and publisher incentives.", "Now I will review the highlights of our fiscal 2018 financial outlook. Further details are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance. Starting with the fiscal first quarter. We expect net sales to range from $240 million to $290 million. The largest contributors are expected to be Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K17 and WWE 2K17. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $390 million to $440 million and cost of goods sold to range from $147 million to $175 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $160 million to $170 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 4% increase over last year, driven by the acquisition of Social Point. Now we expect GAAP net income to range from $74 million to $85 million, or $0.65 to $0.75 per share.", "Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. We expect net sales to range from $1.42 billion to $1.52 billion. This is expected to be down from fiscal 2017 due to fewer new releases and moderating sales from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, partially offset by growth from our NBA 2K and WWE 2K series as well as the acquisition of Social Point. We expect digital to increase as percentage of net sales and to be down slightly on an absolute dollar basis. A slight decline in digitally delivered net sales is expected to be driven by lower full-game downloads due to a lighter release slate, which is expected to be largely offset by mid-single-digit growth in the recurrent consumer spending. The largest contributors in net sales are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online and WWE 2K18. We expect the net sales breakdown from our labels to be roughly 60% 2K, 34% Rockstar Games and 6% Social Point. And we expect our geographic net sales split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We expect to generate approximately $150 million in net cash provided by operating activities, and we plan to deploy approximately $60 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $671 million to $712 million. GAAP net revenue is expected to increase due to the recognition of previously deferred revenues from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online as well as NBA 2K. GAAP cost of goods sold is expected to decrease primarily due to lower software development costs and lower internal royalty. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $720 million to $740 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 10% increase over the prior year, driven by the acquisition of Social Point. And we expect net income to range from $504 million to $540 million, or $4.35 to $4.55 per share.", "In closing, our ability to deliver consistently, the highest quality interactive entertainment experiences balanced with a disciplined focus on operational excellence enabled to deliver growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 is poised to be another strong year for Take-Two, despite an unusually light release slate. And fiscal 2019 promises to be one of our best years yet, with net sales and net cash provided by operating activities expected to exceed $2.5 billion and $700 million, respectively. Over the long term, our company is better positioned than ever to generate growth and margin expansion for our shareholder. Thank you.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another outstanding year. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.", "Mike Olson", "I don't know what you can say around it, but I'm sure there can be various reasons for a game to be delayed, some good in the sense that you could be adding more content or other features or it could be that there's something mechanically wrong with the game. Can you provide any context around what category this delay would fall into? And then secondly, as you said, recurrent consumer spend for GTA Online has grown every year since launch. Does the fiscal 2018 revenue guidance including that GTA Online specifically grows or declines year-over-year?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Mike, it's Strauss. I think the purpose of the delay for Red Dead Redemption 2 is to make sure that we deliver the most extraordinary experience we're capable of providing. We haven't gone into particular issues. We are building a new game from the ground up for the first time for new generation consoles, and the pressure that we put on ourselves to deliver excellence and to delight consumers is extraordinary. And we want to make sure that the appropriate time is taken to do the very best job we can, and I think that's what consumers expect of Rockstar Games, and that's what Rockstar Games typically delivers. So we support emphatically the label's decision, and we're utterly confident that it'll prove that in time to be wise, first and foremost, creatively and artistically and economically as well. And to your second question, Lainie will take that.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Our guidance assumes that GTA Online will moderate in a non-fiscal year 2018. It did grow significantly in 2017, and we continue to support it. But since it's unlike anything else that we've ever had and we have very little visibility into how long it will continue this trend of growth, we've included it as moderating in this year's guidance.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Tim O'Shea with Jeffrey.", "Tim O'Shea", "I just have 2, one for Strauss and one for Lainie. So Strauss, I was just hoping you could share how anticipation is building ahead of the big Red Dead launch and maybe what kind of signals are your tracking from the community that might help give us confidence around how big of a launch this might be. And then just for Lainie, obviously, you're shifting Red Dead into fiscal '19, but as you think about outlook, I'm just curious if there are any costs embedded in that fiscal '18 outlook around Red Dead maybe for marketing or something like that.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes, Tim, I appreciate it. It's not really my nature or our nature to claim victory before it occurs, more a nature to do the very best we can to delight consumers and then report the results. To say that we're highly confident about Red Dead Redemption 2 is an extraordinary understatement, but I'm not sure that really matters. In the fullness of time, the title will be released and consumers get to vote. There is no doubt that the engagement with the materials that we released was extraordinary, the screenshots are beautiful, the buzz is palpable and growing. But beyond that, Rockstar Games will talk about how the title is progressing and how consumers are responding in the fullness of time. So it does fall into the category of how high is up. It is a highly anticipated title, that's an understatement. But it's our style to say, look, we do the very best we can and the results will speak for themselves.", "Lainie Goldstein", "And we are including marketing for Red Dead Redemption 2 in our fiscal year 2018 guidance. Since it's a spring release, we will certainly see some marketing for the title during the fiscal year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.", "Drew Crum", "So I want to go back to GTA Online. Talk about what Rockstar's plans are for content fiscal '18, if there's any change there given the timing of Red Dead 2. And then separately, on Social Point, can you remind us what the earn-outs are for calendar '17 and '18, what's embedded in guidance? And it looks like there's no new games planned for Social Point, but you follow the same protocol, rely on them to make the game announcements and then expound upon those with earnings calls.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Drew, it's Strauss. On GTA Online, we have said that plenty more content is coming. More announcements will be made by Rockstar Games. The title is absolutely being supported by the label. Consumers love it. It remains an enormous focus of everyone's attention. We remain very excited about it even though our financial results are expected to moderate. In terms of Red Dead Redemption 2 coming, that's unrelated to the GTA Online, as I've said many times before, all entertainment from all enterprises competes with everyone and competes with no one. Entertainment stands on its own. No one ever needs another entertainment property. When there's nothing in the marketplace that excites us, we stay home. When there's plenty in the marketplace that excites us, we buy as much as we can afford. So I don't believe there's any connection between Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Redemption 2. And certainly, here, at our enterprise, we're full steam ahead, supporting all of our successful properties and always trying to make more as we go along.", "Karl Slatoff", "And just to address your question about the earn-out. So the sellers are eligible to receive an earn-out. It's public, you can look it out yourself. It's basically 4.5 times every dollar of EBITDA earned by Social Point, in excess of 32.5 million in 2017 and 38.5 million in 2018. And that amount is capped at 25.9 million. That's how the earn-out works. And what's your other question about Social Point? I missed that one.", "Drew Crum", "So you haven't -- it looks like you've not announced any new games as part of fiscal '18. Is it possible some slip in this year? Or should we not assume anything for fiscal '18?", "Karl Slatoff", "What we have said is that Social Point has got a pipeline of games that are coming out over the next couple of years. We'd not announced timing about when those games are. There are games in various stages of development and testing. It's a little bit of a different process than we thought with our other 2 labels just given the nature of the games themselves. It's more of an iterative development and release strategy. But rest assured, there are games in the pipeline over the next couple of years.", "Drew Crum", "Okay. And Karl, just to go back to the first part of the question, the 32 million and 38 million, respectively of EBITDA. Are you assuming that Social Point hit those thresholds as part of your guidance?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We're not commenting on where it fits.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.", "Eric Handler", "When you look at your full-game digital downloads, where are you right now as you end fiscal '17? Like what percentage of your games are getting the full-game download versus what you are implying with your guidance for fiscal '19 -- fiscal '18 and how you think that trend is progressing? Secondly, with regard to your statement about fiscal '19, the last time you guys generated $700 million of operating cash flow was the launch year for GTA 5 and you did $4.26 that year. I'm just curious, is that sort of like a good baseline to think about for EPS in fiscal '19?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks, Eric, and really appreciate the (inaudible). On full-game downloads, digital distribution is responsible for roughly 25% of our console sales and about 90% of our PC sales. For frontline for catalog, it's obviously greater. We expect that in our numbers to be roughly the same going forward. Strategically, however, over time, we think digital distribution grows as a percentage of total revenue. For fiscal '19, we're not commenting on EPS. I think we've given a good deal of visibility already.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post", "Two questions. First, does the delay of Red Dead impact any of other Rockstar's other projects? And then secondly, could you help us frame the opportunity for NBA eSports relative to the current revenues that the franchise is generating? Like how would you think about the incremental revenue opportunity?", "Strauss Zelnick", "The decision to move the release of Red Dead Redemption 2 will have no impact on any of Rockstar Games' other activities. With regard to our eSports venture, about which we're -- we just couldn't be more excited, actually just met yesterday with Brandan and with the Commissioner in for our standard catch-up meetings, and we're just thrilled with the progress that the venture is making. And there'll be more said about that in the future. However, we're not including that progress in our outlook. And that's not because we're not optimistic. We are. It's just too early to size it. We know that if we get this right, there's an amazing opportunity for the fans, and therefore, an amazing economic opportunity. That's always how we look at the world. However, we have not included it in our outlook.", "Justin Post", "Any way of framing it, like three or five years out, like how you think about it?", "Strauss Zelnick", "It's so tempting to share my views. But it sort of falls in the category of -- I'm an optimist. Couple of the folks sitting on the table with me here are pessimists. But it doesn't matter, and we've proven in the 10 years that we managed this business that our opinions are irrelevant. We show up every day, as do 3,400 of our colleagues. We work super hard to be the most creative, efficient and innovative organization in the entertainment business. Sometimes, we get it wrong, and we take responsibility. More often than not, we get it right, and we see the results. That's what we're trying to do here. I'm really confident that we will get it right. And if we do, I think the economic results for both the venture and for our game related to the venture will be nothing short of astonishing. But that's just what I think. And frankly, I wouldn't put a whole lot of stock in that. We're moving in that direction, and certainly, our goal, and it's our collective goal. And look, we're the first professional sport to launch a competitive gaming league. And the excitement among the fans, among the teams at the NBA and here at 2K and Take-Two is palpable. It's our job now to hunker down and turn that into reality, and the money will follow.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of San Phan with Mizuho.", "San Phan", "Can you tell us how much of the growth in NBA 2K unit sales is coming from the U.S. versus international? And then the second question is something more broad. Does the ongoing success you're seeing in recurrent digital spend change your view in strategy with frontline title releases in any way?", "Strauss Zelnick", "So we don't break out international or domestic sales for NBA. However, international growth has been a big benefit for us. We are focused on it. We focus more on localization. We have local commentators. As the sport grows overseas, so does our game. And there's an anonymous amount of ongoing opportunity. In terms of recurrent consumer spending, yes, we have said that as we look at future releases, all of them are built with an eye towards ongoing engagement. So this business used to be a business where we did our best to create this extraordinary experience, the experience was finished, we launched it into the market, the consumer voted, we went on to the next, and we had a catalog. And because the technology was constantly changing to encapsulate the limited value. ", "All of that has now changed in reverse order. Catalog now has much more value. We have the highest-selling catalog per SKU, frankly, because we have the highest Metacritic scores, and our quality holds up over time. People want to play our games many, many years after the release. And equally, we now can look at a hit game and say, when you have a hit title, people want to stay engaged. So we have to plan ahead and say, are we going to have meaningful ongoing opportunities to engage. Each game is different. So we -- each game looks at those meaningful opportunities through a different lens. It could be the lens of a multiplayer version online. It would have, for example, virtual currency sales. ", "It could be a free-to-play title launched by Social Point, which has in-game purchases. It could be NBA 2K online in China, which in-game purchases. It could be WWE SuperCard, which has in-game purchases. It could be downloadable add-on content, for which one pays. It could be free add-on content. Anything that delights consumers and keeps them engaged with our titles and our brands is good for them, and therefore, good for us. And we find that the monetization follows. We're definitely getting better at the data surrounding this. We're getting better at translating engagement into monetization. But at the risk of being repetitive at this company, first and foremost, we focus on the consumer, and the monetization follows.", "San Phan", "So given that your catalog sales are growing, you're getting more existing engagement in existing, growing engagement in existing titles, could we see possibly maybe releasing bigger titles further apart than we would have in years past?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We stated a strategy not to annualize any titles apart from sports entertainment titles 10 years ago, and the market has moved in our direction, has become more complex to deliver big titles and more difficult and more time-consuming to create A-plus quality, which is what the market demands. Our cadence isn't expected to change. And in certain instances, we hope that the time in between releases will actually decrease. I don't expect that the time length between releases will increase.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research.", "Ray Stochel", "I guess, this is going off of the last subject. But do you have any update on the digital strategy for Red Dead Redemption 2?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We've said that there will be an online component, and we'll leave the rest of that discussion to Rockstar Games.", "Ray Stochel", "Got it. And then quick bigger picture follow up. How are you thinking now about your PC distribution strategy as you grow and increasingly become more relevant in the market? What are the pros and cons of owning your own platform?", "Strauss Zelnick", "We do have our own platform. Consumers can buy directly from our store and that's -- it's a small part of our business. In general, it's our view that consumers want to go to a place where they can buy a multiplicity of titles, and the notion of only being able to buy one company's title isn't really the way entertainment is typically consumed. We're quite happy to share with our distribution partners. It's the nature of the entertainment business. And our strategy as opposed to trying to grab all the margin and distribute directly is try to be a really great and trusted partner of an every possible storefront on earth. We've always taken the view that we want to be wherever the consumer is. And the economics of our physical business include sharing. The economics of our digital business include sharing. We'd love, of course, to increase the percentage that we keep. Who wouldn't. But the most important thing, economically speaking, are the dollars that we generate. And we believe that the widest possible distribution is the way to do that. So we know a couple of our competitors have tried really hard to focus entirely on direct distribution. Certainly, there are elements of the free-to-play mobile business that can look a lot like that, but their sharing -- there's always someone you have to share with there. So again, we focus less on what percent we have to share in order to get distribution and more on the dollars that we generate and the availability and ubiquity of our products.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie.", "Ben Schachter", "I have a few quick modeling questions for Lainie and then one for Stauss. Lainie, can you help us with the change in deferred revenues for FY '19? And also what's the tax rate we should be using for '18 and '19? And then also, in the initial guide for FY '19, what's the relative size of Red Dead versus the 2K game discussed in the press release. And then, Strauss, can you discuss Rockstar's capacity to work on more than 2 franchises at one time? We, obviously, know they're working on Red Dead and continuing on GTA. Do they have enough resources to be working on other titles at the same time?", "Lainie Goldstein", "So for -- on the change in deferred revenue for '19, we haven't given out any additional details on '19 other than what we expect in terms of net sales and the cash from operations. And so our tax rate for '18, we're using 22% for our management reportings. And for '19, again, we're not giving any additional information than what we've given already.", "Strauss Zelnick", "And in terms, Ben, of Rockstar's capacity, yes, Rockstar and 2K, both have the capacity to work on a multiplicity of projects. There's attention, of course, in that as we've shown an ability and a willingness to hire plenty of creative talent, the growth in our headcount over the past 10 years has largely been creative headcount. There is attention in finding the best talent in the business. We've made no bones about that. It's true for our competitors who are only looking for the best and the brightest. That said, both 2K and Rockstar have the ability to work on a multiplicity of projects simultaneously. And the question for both of them is how do you direct your resources on the one hand to supporting something that's working mightily now, and on the other hand, to something that will, we hope, work mightily in the future. And that's a decision that is a challenging and complex one that one makes with limited information at every entertainment enterprise. But resources are our issue and ambition isn't our issue. Probably, and to the extent we have a problem, it's a high class problem. We have 11 extraordinary franchises that have each sold over 5 million units in an individual release. We have something like 55 that have sold at least 2 million in individual release. That's pretty different state of play than just a few years ago with this enterprise. We think we have the best collection of owned intellectual property in the business. And basically, our business is exploding in every area, whether that's sports entertainment, whether that's free-to-play, whether that's mobile, whether that's GTA Online, whether that's a sale of GTA 5 itself, nearing 80 million units, and the list goes on. So the question for us is always, how do we reach a new height? And that's what we're focused on at 2K; that's what we're focused on at Rockstar; and certainly, that's what we're focused on at Social Point; and finally, at Take-Two.", "Ben Schachter", "Stauss, if I can just sneak one more in. Can you remind us how you think about excess cash in terms of onetime dividend, buyback? Just in general, your philosophy on what you do with excess cash.", "Strauss Zelnick", "I guess, it is a natural question when we talked about what fiscal '18 looks like, generating about $150 million of cash flow from operations in fiscal '19 where the initial outlook sitting here today is $700 million of cash flow from operations. So it's a fair question, since we just reported $1.4 billion in cash, and we just spent $0.25 billion on an acquisition a few months ago. I would observe these are high-class problems. We said over time that there are 3 areas in which to deploy capital. The first is to support organic growth. This company story has largely been an organic growth story. And we now have the ability to take measured risk when we believe there's a great opportunity for return. And that's has really worked out very well for us. Second, we've said we are now in a position, seriously, to consider accretive inorganic opportunities, and we're acting accordingly with the acquisition of Social Point. And I think, our view is many more opportunities will present themselves. What's our lens? We're highly disciplined strategically, we're highly disciplined economically, we've said we would do deals when they're accretive. Social Point is immediately accretive to the cash flow from operations, and soon, will be accretive to actually revenues and earnings. And we look through that lens. We're not interested in pie in the sky. We're not interested in talking about strategy and overpaying for something. We're certainly not interested in buying a money losing enterprise. Finally, we've shown a willingness to return capital to our shareholders. We'll do buybacks when we can execute them at deep value in our view and in any scholarly view of merit. That's the only time it ever makes sense for an organization to do a buyback. We've done two, both at deep value and with hindsight. Of course, we didn't have hindsight when we made the decision. And we will contemplate other forms of returning cash to the shareholders. Right now, we still have a convertible bond that we have to take care of. That will clean up our balance sheet and leave us entirely debt-free. And so these are issues that we will continue to contemplate going forward. But that's how we look at the world. Specifically, just for transparency, hard for me to believe that a onetime dividend will make sense.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Stephen Ju of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "ChrisHum", "Chris Hum for Steven. Curious about the launch window for Red Dead. Is there something about this game that you feel would make it better for a summer launch versus launching in the winter? And kind of how your expectations have changed since we last talked?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes. For a title like this, I don't think the launch window really matters. And obviously, Red Dead Redemption went out in May and was an extraordinarily successful title. Consumers are consuming entertainment year round. Now they don't stop in the summer months. And we believe that if you give people an extraordinary experience, they will show up for it.", "Operator", "I will now turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "We just want to thank everyone for joining us today. Obviously, we've a lot going on here. Really pleased to report the results that are meaningfully ahead of our initial expectations. We're looking forward to a fiscal year that, despite a rather light frontline release schedule, looks incredibly sound economically. And naturally, we're all super excited about our upcoming release schedule and what that will bring in fiscal '19 and in the years beyond. Thank you so much for joining us today.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Hank Diamond. Thank you, Mr. Diamond. You may begin.", "Henry A. Diamond - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Good afternoon. Welcome and thank you for joining Take-Two's conference call to discuss its results for the second quarter fiscal year 2018 ended September 30, 2017. Today's call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer. We will be available to answer your questions during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "Before we begin, I'd like to note that as previously announced we've changed the name of our operational metric from net sales to net bookings. Our definition of net bookings is identical to our previous definition of net sales. I'd also like to remind everyone that the statements made during this call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. We've no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.", "Actual operating results may vary significantly from the forward-looking statements based on a variety of factors. These important factors are described in our filings with the SEC including the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the risks summarized in the section entitled Risk Factors.", "I'd also like to note that, all numbers we will be discussing today are GAAP. And unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are year-over-year. Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at www.take2games.com.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Strauss.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Hank. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum continued in the second quarter, enabling Take-Two to deliver another period of better than expected operating results. The extraordinary performance of our business is driven by growth from both Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V along with the successful launch of NBA 2K18.", "Grand Theft Auto Online delivered another record quarter, exceeding our net bookings expectations and remains the single largest contributor to recurrent consumer spending. Rockstar Games has continued to sustain an increased engagement through the ongoing release of a rich array of free additional content. Most recently, the Smuggler's Run update and subsequent themed content drops including the Motor Wars and Stockpile Modes, Transform Races and multiple new vehicles. Rockstar Games will support Grand Theft Auto Online with additional new content going forward.", "The second quarter marked the fourth anniversary of the initial launch of Grand Theft Auto V and net bookings from the game grew during the period, confirming the Grand Theft Auto V remains the must have title especially as the installed base of current generation consoles continues to expand. Grand Theft Auto V is now sold in more than 85 million units and according to The NPD Group, the title has achieved 42 top 10 chart appearances during the 50 months since its release, the most by any single title in reported history.", "Grand Theft Auto V is now the all-time bestselling video game, both in revenues and units, based on combined U.S. digital and physical sales across PC, console and portable. As a result of these titles better than expected performance in the quarter and increased outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect combined net bookings from Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V to grow during fiscal 2018.", "On September 15, Visual Concepts and 2K successfully launched NBA 2K18 cementing further the series dominant position as the premier basketball simulation. NBA 2K18 received positive reviews from influential critics including 91 out of 100 from Forbes, 9 out of 10 from Game Informer, and 4.5 out of 5 from Digital Trends.", "Visual Concepts was lauded for the title's exciting new features including this year's edition of the neighborhood, which for the first time enables gamers to explore and play in an immersive live world NBA environment. Today, NBA 2K18 is sold in over six million units and both sell-in and sell-through of the title have grown more than 20% over the prior year's release, including a significant increase in digitally-delivered sales.", "In addition to versions for X-Box, PlayStation, and PC, NBA 2K18 is our debut offering for the Nintendo Switch. So far, we're very pleased with the title's performance on this new platform and we anticipate continued strong demand across all platforms heading into the holiday season. Along with growth in game sales, our NBA 2K series continues to benefit from increasing engagement and recurrent consumer spending.", "To-date, total users and average daily users of NBA 2K18 on current generation platforms is up nearly 30% over last year's release. And during the second quarter, recurrent consumer spending on NBA 2K grew 57% once again exceeding our expectations. We believe that NBA 2K18 will become our most successful sports title ever both in terms of units sold and recurrent consumer spending. I'd like to congratulate Visual Concepts for their unparalleled skill in delivering consistently the authenticity of the NBA and all of its pop culture influences to our passionate community of fans.", "Our second quarter results also benefited from a number of other titles, including NBA 2K17, Social Point mobile games and downloadable add-on content for and sales of XCOM 2. We continue to drive increased engagement with our games. During the second quarter, net bookings from our current consumer spending, which are almost entirely digitally delivered grew 84% to their highest level ever and accounted for 42% of total net bookings.", "In addition to virtual currency for Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by a variety of other offerings. In the free-to-play category, Social Point continued to outperform our expectations with combined net bookings from its two biggest games, Dragon City and Monster Legends growing both sequentially and year-over-year in the second quarter.", "We view Social Point as an important long-term growth opportunity for Take-Two. WWE SuperCard also continued to grow with net bookings from a current consumer spending on the game up 40%. WWE SuperCard is 2K's highest grossing mobile game and has been downloaded more than 15 million times. And NBA 2K Online remains the number one PC online sports game in China with over 36 million registered users.", "In addition, net bookings from add-on content more than doubled led by XCOM 2: War of the Chosen, the expansion pack for the 2016 award-winning strategy titles from Firaxis Games along with offerings for Mafia III and Sid Meier's Civilization.", "As a result of our stellar second quarter operating results and increased outlook for the balance of the year, we've raised our fiscal 2018 outlook for net bookings and net cash provided by operating activities. We now expect fiscal 2018 to be another year of net bookings growth as well as strong cash flow. And looking ahead, fiscal 2019 promises to be one of our best years ever led by the launches of Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption 2 and a highly anticipated new title from one of 2K's biggest franchises.", "Through the advent of new technologies, platforms and business models, our industry continues to evolve and grow, providing exciting new ways for our teams to create groundbreaking entertainment experiences that captivate and engage audiences throughout the world. Take-Two is better positioned than ever creatively, operationally, and financially to capitalize on our numerous opportunities both in our core business and in emerging areas such as mobile and eSports and to deliver value to customers and returns for shareholders over the long term.", "I'll now turn the call over to Karl.", "Karl Slatoff - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Strauss. Today, I'll discuss our recent releases and then review our lineup for the remainder of this fiscal year. On October 13, 2K successfully launched WWE 2K18, the latest installment in our popular simulation-based WWE series. Co-developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, WWE 2K18 received positive review scores including an 84 out of 100 from COGconnected, and an 8.3 out of 10 from Forbes. Critics are praising the title for its brand new graphics engine, the largest roster of playable superstars in the series' history and a host of gameplay additions and improvements.", "According to Forbes, quote, WWE 2K18 is now the standard bearer in visual excellence in sports-themed video games. WWE 2K18 already is off to a solid start and later this fall 2K will release the title for Nintendo Switch, marking the first time in five years that a WWE game has been available on the Nintendo platform.", "In keeping with our focus on driving engagement and recurrent consumer spending, WWE 2K18 is being supported with a series of post-launch downloadable content, including a Season Pass. The worldwide popularity of WWE is as vibrant as ever and we believe that there remains a substantial long-term opportunity to grow our WWE 2K series by leveraging further the development and marketing expertise of 2K and Visual Concepts.", "On October 19, 2K and Firaxis Games released Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Khmer & Indonesia Civilization Scenario Pack, which introduced two new leaders representing civilizations from Southeast Asia. This concept was made available automatically at no extra cost for purchasers of the Civilization VI Digital Deluxe Edition.", "Turning to the balance of our lineup for fiscal year 2018. On November 14, Rockstar Games will release new versions of their blockbuster detective thriller L.A. Noire for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Following these three new console versions in December comes L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, featuring seven select cases from the original game rebuilt specifically for a virtual reality experience on the HTC VIVE system.", "L.A. Noire takes place in the seedy and violent underbelly of 1940's Los Angeles as decorated veteran and newly minted detective, Cole Phelps, investigates an escalating series of cases inspired by real world crimes. Utilizing unique type of facial capture technology called MotionScan, L.A. Noire breathes unprecedented life into character performances, creating brand new gameplay out of the art of interrogation. Originally released in May, 2011, L.A. Noire received critical acclaim and was the first videogame ever to be featured as an Official Selection of the Tribeca Film Festival.", "To-date the title has sold in over 7.5 million units. With a choice of spectacular virtual reality, stunning 4K or the freedom of portable play, these new enhanced versions of L.A. Noire are a perfect opportunity for players to experience this richly-detailed world in an entirely new way.", "During the fourth quarter our independent development partner Squad will release the Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion for PC, adding exciting new content including the Mission Builder and History Pack, the expansion will enhance our recently acquired physics-based space simulation game.", "Mission Builder enables players to create and edit missions that can be shared with the game's vibrant online community. History Pack challenges players to relive historic missions from humankind's own space program, complete with the unique Kerbal Space Program twist.", "The new Kerbal Space Program has as a new long-term franchise that complements our portfolio of own intellectual property, as we continue to capitalize on opportunities across the independent development landscape. The growing popularity of eSports is an exciting trend in our industry and both our team and NBA are hard at work on preparing for the May, 2018 launch of NBA 2K League.", "Beginning in February, the league will introduce its online qualification system to identify the best NBA 2K players, which will be followed by a draft to fill each team's five player roster. League team members will play the game using newly created avatars and therefore, playing ability will be determined strictly by skill. NBA 2K League players will live in their teams market during the season, which we believe will create deeper and stronger team bonds and dynamics. We are thrilled that the NBA 2K League is taking shape and look forward to expanding our presence in competitive gaming, which is a long-term potential to create deeper engagement with the player community and to be a meaningful driver of profits for our company.", "Social Point is also hard at work and has a number of exciting games planned for launch over the next two years. Looking ahead, we have a robust development pipeline across our labels including new releases from our popular series and groundbreaking original intellectual property. We remain committed to providing our audiences with highest quality entertainment including innovative offerings, designed to drive growth in engagement and recurring consumer spending coupled with our many opportunities for expanding our business through emerging platforms, business models and geographies. There has never been a more exciting time for our company and industry.", "I will now turn the call over Lainie.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Karl. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2018. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and financial outlook are contained in our press release, including the items that our management uses internally to adjust our GAAP financial results in order to evaluate our operating performance.", "I'd also like to note that as we announced last week, we changed the name of our operational metric from net sales to net bookings. We have made this change to avoid confusion with the net sales caption used by some companies in their GAAP financial statements, and to be consistent with operational metrics provided by our peers. The definition of net bookings is identical to our previous definition of net sales.", "As mentioned by Strauss, we had an outstanding second quarter from an operating perspective driven by the continued outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, as well as the stronger than expected launch of NBA 2K18.", "Total net bookings grew 20% to $577 million. Of this amount 62% were digitally-delivered net booking, which grew 52% to $356 million. Our digitally-delivered net bookings were driven by record recurrent consumer spending, along with growth and full game downloads. While the operating performance of our business exceeded our expectation, this outperformance is not fully reflected in our GAAP results for three reasons. First, our better than expected net bookings were driven by titles that we are required to defer and therefore our GAAP revenues and profits will not fully benefit from these sales until future \u2013 period.", "Second, because of the better than expected performance of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, we recorded higher than forecasted internal royalties, which are calculated using results that are adjusted to exclude the impact of deferrals, and unlike certain other costs of goods sold are not deferred. And third, we recorded higher stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the increase in our share price.", "Turning to some details from our second quarter income statement, GAAP net revenue exceeded our outlook and grew by 6% to $444 million. Cost of goods sold increased by 20% to $247 million. Operating expenses increased by 24% to $208 million, due primarily to the inclusion of Social Point as well as higher stock-based compensation, bonus and head count expenses, which were partially offset by lower marketing expense.", "Our GAAP results reflect $12 million tax benefit, which is driven primarily by tax deductions related to stock compensation expense. These additional tax deductions are due to the increase in our stock price from the date that stock was granted to the date that has vested. This benefit had no effect on the management reporting tax rate, which is 22%. And we reported GAAP net loss of $3 million, or $0.03 per share versus net income of $36 million or $0.39 per share in the prior-year period.", "Now, I will review the highlights of our fiscal 2018 financial outlook. Starting with the fiscal third quarter, we expect net bookings to range from $610 million to $660 million. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K18 and WWE 2K18. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $440 million to $490 million and cost of goods sold to range from $262 million to $291 million.", "Operating expenses are expected to range from $220 million to $230 million. At the midpoint, this represents the 16% increase over last year, driven by the inclusion of Social Point as well as the higher R&D and stock compensation expense. We expect GAAP net loss to range from $29 million to $40 million or $0.25 to $0.35 per share.", "Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year. As a result of our better than expected second quarter operating results and improved forecast for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our outlook for net bookings and net cash provided by operating activity.", "We now expect net bookings to range from $1.93 billion to $2.03 billion up from our prior outlook of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion and up from $1.9 billion last year. Net bookings are expected to increase in fiscal 2018 driven by growth from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto, as well as inclusion of our full year net bookings with Social Point, partially offset by our lighter release slate.", "We now expect net bookings from current consumer spending to increase approximately 50%, and we expect digitally-delivered net bookings to grow around 25%. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K and WWE 2K18. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% 2K, 45% Rockstar Games, and 5% Social Point and other. We expect our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States, 40% International. We now expect to generate approximately $300 million in net cash provided by operating activities up from our prior outlook of $200 million and we plan to deploy approximately $60 million to capital expenditures.", "Turning to our income statement, we expect GAAP net revenues to range from $1.74 billion to $1.84 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $893 million to $944 million. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $805 million to $825 million, and the midpoint this represents a 22% increase over the prior year, driven by the inclusion of Social Point, higher R&D expense and higher stock-based compensation expense.", "Although our operating performance is exceeding expectations, we are increasing our fiscal 2018 outlook for net bookings and net cash provided by operating activities. We are reducing our forecast for GAAP net income. This is due to two factors \u2013 first, because of the strong ongoing performance of Grand Theft Auto, we expect to record higher internal royalties, which unlike certain other cost of goods sold are not deferred.", "And second, we now expect higher stock-based compensation due primarily to the increase in our share price. As a result, we now expect GAAP net income to range from $63 million to $91 million or $0.55 to $0.80 per share.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our operating results for the first half of fiscal 2018, which is poised to be another year of net bookings growth and strong cash flow for our organization. However, we believe that fiscal 2019 will be a record year for both net bookings and net cash provided by operating activities, which are expected to exceed $2.5 billion and $700 million respectively. With an industry-leading creative assets, commitment to operational excellence, and strong financial foundation, Take-Two is well-positioned to generate growth and margin expansion over the long term.", "Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another strong quarter for our organization. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you for taking my question. I guess \u2013 I guess two. Strauss, one industry question, there were some concerns about NBA and we hear with other games about maybe too much monetization opportunities for MTX taking away from the game. It clearly doesn't seem to be happening in NBA but just give me your high-level thoughts on that.", "And then second, on Take-Two specifically, you haven't raised your outlook for 2019. Clearly all your digital trends are way above where you thought six months ago when you gave that guidance. How do you think about next year given the strength in digital this year? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks. Thanks, Justin. Look, we take consumer feedback very, very seriously indeed. And you're right. There's been some pushback about monetization in the industry. The good news is the title was reviewed extraordinarily well. People love it. And the other news is, entertainment is a want-to-have business, not a must-have business and people vote ultimately with the usage and the usage on the title is up 30% in terms of average daily users. The title itself, say, unit sales were up 20% year-over-year. So, people clearly are voting that they love NBA 2K18 and the reviews reflect that as well. That said, we are concerned about any perception, any negative feedback. And we're focused on it and we're taking it really seriously. And Lainie will talk about next year.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Sure. For 2019, we are reiterating the guidance that we've given so far on that year. We continue to look at it. We said that we're going to exceed $2.5 billion and exceed $700 million in operating cash flow. So, in terms of giving out more detailed guidance and updating that information, I think we would probably look to do that on our May call with our year-end earnings.", "Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you and good quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim O'Shea of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mr. O'Shea. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.", "Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC", "Yes, hi. So, thank you for taking my question. GTA Online continues to impress. It's another record breaking quarter and as you mentioned, it's the fourth anniversary of GTA V. On prior calls, we've heard a bunch of questions asking when GTA Online would start to tail off. But given the continued record breaking quarters, I'm just curious how many more years of GTA Online, how many more years GTA Online might continue to thrive and how does the upcoming launch of Red Dead influence your thinking here.", "And then just secondly, you're obviously taking up your full-year EPS outlook substantially. I was just hoping you might help us understand what's behind that optimism, how much of this is coming from GTA Online and how much from NBA? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, thank you. Look, GTA Online continues to delight consumers and therefore our results are also excellent. And Rockstar Games have said, they'll continue to support Grand Theft Auto Online with content going forward. Then undoubtedly, it's this ongoing robust content creation that continues to delight consumers. There's clearly a community of people who love Grand Theft Auto Online and once again we're having a record year. We can't say much more than that except that we're so extraordinarily pleased and to look further into the future is impossible at this time.", "With regard to your question on Red Dead, though I have a strong point of view, which is look, entertainment competes with every activity and no activity. And to the extent that we are competitive, we compete with all of our own titles and everyone else's titles too. So, I don't think the launch of any new title specifically has a direct effect on an existing title any more than someone else launching a competitive title would affect for example how one of our titles is doing. If we have something great in the market and we continue to support it with great content, people will continue to show up. That's historically the case and certainly that's our aim. So, we think Red Dead stands alone. Naturally we're incredibly excited. I think the whole market is. And, but it will stand alone and succeed on its own merits.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So, for the full year, when we looked at raising our guidance, we looked at how much we beat the second quarter by and then we also looked at the remainder of the year and it's reflecting higher expectations for Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V as well as NBA 2K18.", "Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC", "Great. Thanks so much and congrats again on the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Yes, two questions. First, I wonder if you'd be willing to dig in on NBA 2K a little bit in terms of for last year's game as you look back the last 12 months, what percentage of revenue was attributable to the full game sale, be it retail and full game downloads, and what percentage of revenue was related to micro transactions?", "And then secondly, wondered if you could talk a little bit about Social Point. It looks like internationally, I don't know if it's beta or what type of test you're running for a game, League of Dragons, and at what point do you think of going global with that launch and sort of how do you think about that progressing over the next year?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "I've got it. Sorry, okay. Hi, Eric. We'll start with Social Point. So, yes, we did actually launch. We had a soft launch of the title called League of Dragons and it was a very limited soft launch, just like a market. That's typically how you do these things before we take a global launch, I think you're familiar with that strategy. Based on what we've seen and the KPIs associated with title, we decided that it didn't make sense to move forward.", "So, that title will not be getting a worldwide release. That being said, the two games that Social Point has right now in the market, Monster Legends and Dragon City are both performing above our expectations and are growing quarter-over-quarter and also year-over-year. So, they're very positive for us and as we said in our opening remarks, Social Point has a number of games that are getting ready for release over the next couple of years. We're very excited about this opportunity. And in terms of the NBA 2K, the percentages of \u2013 that you wanted to hear about, we don't give that kind of detail by title in terms of micro transactions, full games downloads et cetera.", "Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC", "Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Evan Wingren of Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Following up with the NBA a little bit, I was wondering if you could share what percentage of the unit sales that you did disclose came from digital this quarter. And then, secondarily you mentioned the growth in recurrent spending in the NBA and I just wondered if you could break apart the \u2013 whether you're seeing growth in the component \u2013 in all components or if it's just from new players?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Go ahead.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Evan, for full game downloads on new consoles, we're seeing about 35%. We're not giving it specifically by title, but overall that's what we're seeing in Q2 for the business and that's what we would expect to see for the full year.", "Karl Slatoff - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "And in terms of the components on NBA, like we said before, we are seeing growth in our users \u2013 our daily active users and \u2013 so that is up and our unit growth is up in general. We haven't broken it down anymore specifically than that.", "Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher David Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "All right. Great. Thank you. Just a couple questions. First for GTA Online, last quarter, I think you guided to a moderation in the back of the year. Of course, you posted another record quarter in the fiscal 2Q. So, do you continue to expect to see a moderation for that title in the back half or do you expect to see growth?", "Just secondly, Lainie, I know you just mentioned I think 35% was the expectation for digital download for the year. I think last quarter you talked about a 30% expectation, so can you just talk about what sort of changed that? I mean and how if at all, you started to really try to incentivize the gamers to download more? Thank you.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Chris. No, we do not expect moderation in Grand Theft Auto Online in the back half of the year. Looks like it's very strong and as we said, it will be another record year, which is obviously very gratifying. And on the digital download side for full games, we are continuing to see growth in that area, obviously for PC titles it's over 90% and for non-PC titles, surrounding around 35%, as Lainie said across the board.", "Lainie Goldstein - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "And our catalogue is also running at about 50%. And there is a big mix of our catalogue business throughout the remainder of the year.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Right. So, and it's a good thing for us naturally. We do have \u2013 make more dollars per unit sold digitally and we have a higher percentage margin. That said, we are where the consumer is and physical distribution still is the lion's share of our business.", "Christopher David Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Hey, good afternoon. As far as the NBA 2K League, do you have any plans for broadcast, will it be primarily online or could there be also broadcast TV viewing opportunities? And will there be marketing for the league during traditional NBA games or how will you kind of tie those two together? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So, we haven't given that detail yet. There will be a media rights associated with the NBA 2K League and that will be announced in due time. Our crew over there led by Brendan Donahue is doing a phenomenal job. Karl talked a little bit about what's coming in 2018. We're super excited to have teams, have a draft of teams and to have a season with 17 teams participating. More details to come, but obviously there will be media available and not much more detail to give out right now.", "Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ray Stochel of Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Hi guys, thanks for taking the call. With the success of Grand Theft Auto Online, are you thinking about adding any talent to increase the cadence of GTA Online updates over the coming year or two?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "We're always adding talent across the company. Our head count grows but our head count grows only on the side of creating great games and great content and that's everywhere in our business. So, we \u2013 across the board, we are a growth enterprise and we are always looking for the best and brightest talent. Right now we're really happy with the content that we're putting out across the board and we have wonderful people who are responsible for doing that every day.", "Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Got it. That's great. And also a quick follow up on talent. There has been some studio closures in the space, one public and some layoffs at a private competitor today. Longer term, I guess, where are you seeing talent availability? And do you see anything specific regarding domestic or within your current studios or whether that be in international new markets and new studios? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "We, as I said, we're in growth mode on and we're blessed we get to work with the best and the brightest around the world. It's no secret that hiring phenomenal engineering and artistic talent in the United States is exceedingly challenging. And so, we're open-minded about where we may open studios going forward. But we will go where the talent is. This is a worldwide business and we have a worldwide footprint. So, we're \u2013 as I said, we're in growth mode and I suspect we will be broadening our physical presence to make sure that we are where the talent is.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Hey guys, congrats on an awesome quarter. Becoming a habit for you here. I guess, it's always, I think hard for you to add too much color to the Rockstar team, but it looks like the \u2013 as it relates to GTA Online, the marketing efforts from the team there as it relates to incremental content coming in seems to have intensified. Curious if that's true and how impactful you think that's been for the ongoing success of that game? I have a quick follow up.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Sorry, Mike, I'm sorry, I missed the marketing part of that question.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Yeah, that was the question. Just curious the \u2013 it looks like the marketing of additional content for GTA Online is intensified. Just in terms of some of the trailers and maybe the energy put behind it, I'm curious, if that was true, and if that's at all impactful to the success of that game?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Yeah, sorry, it took me \u2013 I'm extremely slow on the uptake today, Mike. The answer is that the marketing is related to the content drops. So, as content drops come out as they're significant and meaningful, it's important that we let people know about them. I think, I think the marketing is informative than entertaining, and certainly, we wouldn't do it, if we didn't think it had a beneficial impact. But what drives consumption and delight is obviously the content itself.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "Yeah. Fair enough. Good. I guess, under the theme of extending your player base, Rockstar is obviously preparing to launch L.A. Noire for the Switch. Curious how you think about the opportunity for other Rockstar content on that platform?", "And then also thinking about China, I think you've obviously been seemingly more optimistic over time in terms of getting content into that region. Curious your thoughts on the potential opportunity of Red Dead being a commercial opportunity in China, especially as that pay-to-play model seems to be working with other games?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Yeah. So, in terms of our other titles for the Switch from Rockstar. Rockstar hasn't made any announcements yet. And of course, as you know, our labels make announcements about what's coming out. We don't intend to do that on these calls. But clearly, the installed base for Switch has grown rapidly and it's potentially an exciting platform. We've already put out a title for basketball. So, we are supportive of the platform corporately.", "And in terms of China, look, this is a massive market, as you know. It's also a market that is constrained in any number of ways. I'm hopeful that over time those constraints will lessen. Intellectual property is a particularly challenging area in China and we think there's great opportunity. We're thrilled to work with local partners. We're working with Tencent for a long time. They're a wonderful partner on NBA 2K Online and we've had phenomenal results. So, we're happy to work with local partners. I do think it is very important that we have reciprocity in markets and our markets are wide open. And I think it's important that foreign markets become open. And America's second biggest export category after aerospace is entertainment. We're not alone in these interests. I will say that we are ready when China is ready and we think that providing the best quality entertainment on earth is always a benefit to a population, but of course we feel that way.", "Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey, guys. A few questions for you. So, what do you think are really the key lessons from GTA that you expect to bring to other titles in the future? And should we expect you to continue to move down the price curve on the full game in order to drive more players to GTA Online?", "And separately on NBA 2K, should we expect any meaningful revenue from the online tryouts this year? And then finally, on mobile beyond Social Point, should we expect intellectual property from other undertake to areas to come to mobile in any meaningful way in FY 2019 and beyond? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Thanks, Ben. Look, I think the key lesson from GTA Online, remember we launched that title four years ago, so we certainly have learned a lot from what we knew four years ago. And one of the things that we learned is, if we create a robust opportunity and a robust world in which people can play delightfully in a bigger and bigger way that they will keep coming back and they will engage and if there is an opportunity to monetize that engagement. And we've announced that there will be an online component to Red Dead.", "And furthermore we've said that we aim to have recurrent consumer spending options for every title that we put out at this company. It may not always be an online model. It may not, probably won't always be a virtual currency model, but there'll be some ability to engage on an ongoing basis with our titles after release across the board.", "And that's a sea change in our business, and recurrent consumer spending is 42% of our net bookings in the quarter. It's been transformative for us and the only reason it's transformative for us is because it's transformative to our consumers. The business that once upon a time was a big chunky opportunity to engage for tens of hours or perhaps 100 hours has turned into ongoing engagement, day-after-day, week-after-week. You fall in love with these titles and they become part of your daily life.", "And that's immensely exciting and it's the beginning of the maturation of interactive entertainment as a part of the audio-visual entertainment industry. I just saw a study, the American media day, average media day is about 22 hours. Obviously, people are sleeping and eating. What it means is they're parallel processing and they're consuming a lot of different kinds of media. But within that 22-hour day, only about an hour-and-a-half is interactive entertainment. There's a lot of room for growth. This is just the beginning.", "In terms of price curve on Grand Theft Auto, we really haven't talked about that but this has been largely a full price business, which is super exciting. In terms of revenues with regard to the NBA 2K League, we're going to let the league's management talk about that when the time comes. We have said that we have not modeled in or guided against revenues or profits coming from the NBA 2K League. That's not what this is about. This is about creating a brand new business, brand new sport, and continuing to grow our footprint in our basketball business and to interact with consumers in that way. Do I think there is a revenue and profit opportunity? Unquestionably. Are we prepared to say more about it at this time? We are not.", "And finally, on mobile and free-to-play, yes, selectively beyond Social Point, there will be opportunities at the rest of our enterprise. As you can see, our success has been driven when we're very selective. We've done very well with the NBA 2K app. We've done phenomenally well with WWE SuperCard. We think there will continue to be opportunities that are driven by existing core intellectual property. So, we think we sort of have the one-two punch now. Standalone new intellectual property brought to you by Social Point, intellectual property that is known and beloved brought to you by the rest of our company and that's super exciting to us.", "Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Excellent. Good luck going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess taking a step back from the quarter for a second, clearly you're on a trajectory for much higher profitability and you have been for quite some time. So, what do you feel has been the biggest difference for Take-Two achieving and then maybe sustaining the margins of your peers' let's call it 30% plus range. And along those lines, what do you see over the next two to three years changing for Take-Two specifically? Does that could get you guys there and more importantly keep you guys in that 30% plus range? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Right. So, let's distinguish gross margins from operating margins. I assume you're referring to operating margins. On the gross margin side we're highly competitive. And our gross margins continue to go up and they're phenomenal. A couple of our competitors account slightly differently. And so, it's not necessarily apples-to-apples. But on an apples-to-apples basis our gross margins are as high as of now, higher than anyone else's.", "On an operating level, you're absolutely right. Our margin \u2013 our operating margins are a bit lower than our two biggest competitors and they need to grow and it's a matter of scale, but obviously you can't gain scale and sacrifice success. You have to have successful scale. We can't improve our margins with loss properties. So, it's not as simple as just doing more. We have to do better and do more and what we're focused on here entirely is, do better and that served us incredibly well.", "The good news is, we're in a growth business. You've seen that with our net bookings this year. Lainie talked about our expectations for next year. We have to continue to grow. We have incredibly ambitious people here both at the corporate level and emphatically at the labor level. Everyone's pulling in the same direction, what will cause us to grow. It's continuing to build our collection of the best intellectual property, continuing to attract, retain and lead the best creative talent and continue to focus first and foremost on making the consumers happy and meeting consumers' needs, all good things will come from that path.", "Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And then maybe just one more follow-up on an earlier question. So when you think about the long-lived success of GTA Online and the high margin recurrent nature of that; has that changed Rockstar's view in any way in terms of when they want to release another product into franchise or in other words do they still believe a standalone release makes sense versus continuing to support GTA Online with extra content? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "We, as you know, we don' speak for labels. We're thrilled to have a set up here where our labels speak to consumers when they're ready. And I think all we can express here is enormous gratitude for the success of Grand Theft Auto Online and a belief in \u2013 enormous belief from Rockstar's ongoing success.", "Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great and congratulations on the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Krasik of Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Hey, everyone. Let me add my congratulations. Two questions. I guess first, can you just remind us what the last L.A. Noire did and if that's a good guide for what's in the guidance for this year. And then I know you don't talk about the GTA Online attach rates or how many people are playing it, but as you've added new users, as \u2013 from GTA 5 what has been the behavior of those, have they transferred at the same rate as is historically? And what's the opportunity for people maybe that you've lost over, over the last three or four years?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "So, I'm sorry maybe somewhat unsatisfying. L.A. Noire is sold in about 7.5 million units over the course of the franchise across \u2013 across the various SKUs, which is terrific. We haven't singled it out going forward from the guidance point of view. We don't typically do that with our titles. And on Grand Theft Auto Online we don't \u2013 we don't have any info \u2013 we don't share information on specific data around users or attach rates. So, we, perhaps at this point pretty much shared the data that we're going to be sharing on Grand Theft Auto Online today.", "Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Well, less looking for data, more about behavior. Have people shifted? Are there opportunities to re-engage people who may have dropped off?", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "There's unquestionably opportunity to re-engage people based on content drops. And when we drop new content, we see results in terms of engagement. And engagement typically does drive revenue.", "Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz of Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yeah, thanks. As Grand Theft Auto Online has inflected higher, can you maybe talk about whether you've been able to do that using the same resource base as you've sort of had working on for the last few years or have you been allocating more resources to it to drive the growth? Thanks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Rockstar is growing, 2K is growing, Social Point is growing to support the existing opportunities and the new opportunities. And, I think, we're having success across all of our label groups. We are definitely in growth mode. I probably am not going to get more granular than that.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "There are no further questions over the audio portion in the conference. I now like to turn the conference back over the Take-Two management for closing remarks.", "Strauss H. Zelnick - Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.", "Well, first of all, I just like to thank everyone for joining us today. I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues across the company, who delivered these phenomenal results. And I want to thank our consumers who support us and are absolutely passionate about what we do and that drives us and excites us and makes us want to come to work every day. On behalf of the company, I'd like to wish all of you a happy and healthy holiday season and a great New Year.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Our digitally delivered net bookings were driven by record recurrent consumer spending, which was partially offset by lower booking downloads due to this year's later holiday release late.", "We generated strong cash provided by operating activities of $203 million and we deployed $50 million for capital expenditures. As a result of favorable market conditions, we were able to spend $110 million to repurchase 1.6 million shares of our stock at an average price of $103.54. As of December 31, we had more than $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.", "Turning to some details from our third quarter income statement, GAAP net revenue exceeded our outlook and grew to $481 million. Cost of goods sold decreased by 14% to $268 dollars. Operating expenses increased by 5% to $204 million, due primarily to the inclusion of social point, as well as our higher stock-based compensation and headcount expenses which are partially offset by lower marketing expenses.", "Operating expenses were lower than our expectations, due primarily to the timing of marketing campaigns. And GAAP net income exceeded our outlook increasing to $25 dollars or $0.21 per share price.", "Our GAAP results reflect the $30 million net tax benefit which is driven primarily by changes in valuation allowance, release of unrecognized tax benefit due to statute expirations and the net effect of changes resulting from the Tax Spreads and Jobs Act. ", "Tax benefit had no effect on our management reporting tax rate which is 22% for fiscal 2018. We\u2019re in the process of evaluating whether the recent tax legislation will reduce our management supporting tax rates in fiscal 2019. We expect to provide more clarity on our fourth quarter earnings call.", "Now I will review the highlights of our fiscal 2015 financial outlook. Starting with the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect net bookings to range from $410 million to $460 million. At the midpoint, this represents 7% growth over the prior year period. The largest contributors to the net bookings outlook are Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K 18 and WWE 2K 18. ", "We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $460 million to $510 million and cost of goods sold to range from $196 million to $225 million. Our operating expenses are forecasted to range from $190 million to $200 million.", "At the midpoint this represents 34% plus an increase over last year, driven by the inclusion of social points as well as higher marketing and R&D expense. And we expect GAAP net income range from $87 million to $99 million or $0.73 to $0.83 cents per share.", "Turning to our outlook for the full fiscal year, as a result of our strong third quarter results and improved forecasts for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our outlook for net bookings. We now forecast net bookings to range from $1.99 billion to $2.04 billion up from our prior outlook of $1.93 billion to $2.03 billion.", "As a midpoint, this represents 6% growth over the prior year. By the lighter release fleet driven primarily by growth in NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto, as well as the inclusion of a full year of net bookings and social points. We continue to expect net bookings from the current consumer spending to increase approximately 50% and digitally deliver net bookings to grow around 25%.", "The largest contributors to our net bookings outlook for Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K and WWE 2K. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 50% 2K, 45% Roaster games and 5% social point and other. And we forecast a geographic net bookings to be about 60% in I-State and 40% international. We continue to expect to generate approximately $300 million net cash provided by operating activity, and we plan to deploy approximately $60 million to capital expenditure.", "Turning to our income statement, we are increasing our outlook for both GAAP net revenue and GAAP net income. We expect GAAP net revenue to grow through a range of $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $905 million to $934 million.", "Total operating expenses are forecasted to range from $776 million to $786 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 17% increase over the prior year, driven by the inclusion of social points, higher R&D expense and higher stock based compensation expense. And we expect GAAP net income to range - increase to range of $170 million to $181 million, $1.50 to $1.60 per share.", "In closing, the continued positive momentum of our business reflects Take Two's ability to see these goals of our firm commitment to creative leadership, innovation and operational excellence. As we near the close of fiscal 2018 which will be another year of net bookings revenue and earnings growth for our organization, we remain focused on our many opportunities to expand our business and increase profit.", "To that end, we expect fiscal 2019 to be a record year for both net bookings and net cash provided by operating activities and the long term future of our company has never been more promising. Thank you.", "Now I will turn the call back to Strauss.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks Karl and Lainie. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering another strong quarter for our organization and to our shareholders I want to express our appreciation for your continued support.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Handler", "Actually two questions for you. Strauss just as you look into fiscal '19 and using your guys words, you have a highly anticipated game from the 2K Studio. One would presume that is again, that's well known either Bioshark or Borderlands - a new Borderlands title. Many people are thinking Borderlands, given that you have decent lead times for these games from a marketing perspective that would seem to suggest, it's a back half of your title. Then it becomes a question of would you want it to compete in the December quarter against Red Dead and assuming probably not, then it becomes a March quarter title?", "And you think about the March quarter versus on October quarter which should be fiscal - December quarter, sorry - which would be fiscal '20. Can you talk about, how you feel about some of these games coming in on March quarter versus coming in the holiday quarter and how you think about that with some of the big 2K Games?", "And then secondly it was good to see capital being turned to shareholders, $100 million in the share buyback. Just curious, why you think that this quarter was a good use of that capital versus prior quarters when those share price was lower.", "Strauss Zelnick", "We've released titles all over the calendar year and the only period of time that we tend to avoid a big frontline release would be dog days of July. And so otherwise you know our release dates are driven by when a title is ready and when a title is ready to us is, when we have -- our studious believe they've optimized the quality of what we can do and that's how we'll continue to look at it going forward.", "More specific information will come from our labels as always. And in terms of the buyback you know we've always said that, we would look to do a buyback a deep value and that is in the eye of the holder. The management team voted by buying back over $100 million of stock at a $103 a share.", "And in terms of why we might have or might not have done it earlier, we have done buybacks earlier. We bought back about little less than $300 million worth of stock in the past several years and admittedly lower prices. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have bought as much as we possibly could buy when the stock was put up naturally we didn't have that benefit prospectively.", "And we're always balancing our perception of the value of the enterprise with the solidity of our balance sheet. And we do have other uses for cash supporting organic growth which has really been the story around here, supporting organic growth and we did a meaningful acquisition last year. And of course, returning capital to shareholders appropriately.", "So I wouldn't say that, we've optimized perfectly. I think that's very hard to do and say that we see ourselves as stock pickers or even stock price pickers even with regard to our own security, now our folks as heads down building this business.", "We do run a very, very disciplined operation particularly on the financial side. Thanks to Lainie and the team. As you know, we do everything we can to mitigate risk and that includes the nature of our balance sheet.", "Eric Handler", "And just a quick follow up to that, you were buying back some stock is that a reflection that all, that there is just not a lot to buy right now in the M&A market?", "Strauss Zelnick", "No, we still think there's plenty of opportunity. We're very selective about those opportunities. We\u2019ve talked about this in the past and I think it will work. We have a terrific corporate development team. We look at everything that's potentially available.", "And one of the things you ask yourself is that as I look back and we've been around here for the better part of 10 years, you know they look back other things I wish, I would have done is price at which they got done. And I suppose there are couple of transactions that would fall into that category, but precious few.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Merwin", "I just had a couple. So, if you could talk a little bit about the growth in reoccur contributor spenders still obviously very impressive number on an absolute basis, but it did slow pretty significantly from fiscal 2Q. So just wondering if you could talk about what the main cause of that, was maybe just like large numbers but any color there would be appreciated?", "And just a second question on the social point. I think you mentioned that asset continue to perform really well, I just was wondering if you could update us on its contribution to total revenue or growth rate there?", "And then just as a related question if you see an opportunity to take any of your IP from Rockstar Take-Two and leverage social point developers to release that on mobile? Thank you.", "Lainie Goldstein", "In terms of consumer spending it is continuing to grow. For us is a big focus for us in all of our game. For instance, GTA Online Q3 was our biggest quarter ever, and it's up significantly over last year. So we're still very focused on it. We think there's a lot more opportunity there. And we\u2019re focused on our NBA game as well as our consumer spending.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Right, changes in between quarters, we're not - it is a very hard to comp quarter to quarter because titles expand and certain times contract even in the context of continued growth. And there is seasonality, little bit of seasonality in our business.", "So, you wouldn't you can't really comp quarter to quarter or same quarter over prior year quarter, those comps just don't make sense. For example, our third quarter was quite different this year for fiscal than the prior fiscal because we did different release schedule.", "On your question about social points, social point and the private division games I think represent around 5% of our revenue. So it's still relatively small percent of our revenue.", "We're excited about the potential growth in that area. In terms of intellectual property, social points mission is to create and build endemic made for mobile properties and those are the properties that tends to do best in the mobile space. Now it is true 2K has done really well with the WWE. SuperCard we've done well with our NBA App and we expect to continue to support titles like that through to 2K division.", "Social point certainly has the ability to work with both internal labels and external labels on licensed properties, but generally speaking we think the best way to go is to make titles that are meant for the business channel, the consumer channel the hand and to own that intellectual property.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ", "Justin Post", "A couple of questions. First looks like your recurrent consumer spending, prepared remarks was better than expected. But you're kind of in the range this quarter versus the last few quarters. So just wondering if anything kind of missed your expectations or was below forecast on packaged goods or other revenue side?", "And then Lainie, I just wanted you know it looks like the balance sheet the convertibles off the balance you just want to confirm that? And what\u2019s a good share count to users, is the 118 non-GAAP reported in the quarter a good fully diluted share count to use? Thank you. ", "Strauss Zelnick", "Yes no, everything is going better than expected. We obviously did much better than expected in the quarter pretty much across the board where it counts. And we were at the very high end of our range, in terms of net bookings and obviously the cash flow provided by operating activity is meaningfully better than expectations and we have guided up for the year.", "So we're excited about how things continue to unfold. NBA 2K is up 25% year-over-year and was the number two selling title in 2017 and Grand Theft Auto V 4 years after its initial release was actually the number three selling title according to the NPD Group in terms of units in 2017. We have more users than ever playing Grand Theft Auto Online in the third quarter. We're expecting another record year for Grand Theft Auto online.", "So everything is going better than expected and we do have pretty high expectations around here and Lainie will talk about the share count. ", "Lainie Goldstein", "So for that covert that\u2019s less on the balance sheet, so we still have data about 13.8 million and it represents about approximately 500,000 shares that are left. So all the shares have been moved into the share count. So for Q4 if you see our press release we have 118.5 million shares in the count and for the full year 119.5 million shares.", "Justin Post", "Thank you.", "Lainie Goldstein", "Sorry, its 118 for the full year.", "Karl Slatoff", "And Justin that's only down in our press release.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. ", "Ryan Gee", "I appreciate the color on GTA Online players. I just wanted to ask about the revenue, did you say in your prepared remarks the GTA Online stand is also a record this quarter?", "And then when you think about it the do\u2019s day highs that obviously launched in late in December. So, could you expect that content to be in an even larger tailwind for RCS as we move into fiscal 4Q and in the fiscal '19 and then I have just one follow up?", "Strauss Zelnick ", "Yes, you're right that things have gone really well for Grand Theft Auto online in the third quarter. It performed better than expected and we think a big part of that performance is Rockstars ongoing content drops which have been nothing short of phenomenal. And Rockstar games were intense Grand Theft Auto online with more content going forward. And we did have a record number of users.", "Lainie Goldstein ", "We had a record quarter in Q3.", "Ryan Gee", "And then is there any new content updates for GTA Online implied into the guidance for fiscal 4Q at all?", "Lainie Goldstein", "In fiscal Q4, we included higher GTA Online revenue over last year, but not as high as Q3 and there was a record quarter for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. ", "Mike Olson", "I had a couple of questions on NBA 2K. I'm wondering if you could talk about what kinds of tactics you're using in NBA 2K 18 to drive the significant growth in recurring consumer spend? And then secondly on eSports, do you view the NBA 2K League as more of a potential revenue driver or more of a marketing halo for increased engagement in the game?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Remember our strategy is always to captivate and engage consumers and you know the revenues are a function of that strategy, it's not the other way around. And however, we can keep consumers excited and make them happier, that's how we do it. And it is true that the fact of doing that has been that we've had really great results.", "Our strategy is driven by the goal of making great entertainment and the world has changed. Used to be that one prime time we put our title people engaged. Now it was over we went after that title.", "Now if you do it right, there is an opportunity to keep people engaged and having an online cohort does exactly that. And basketball has been succeeding mightily with recurrent consumer spending.", "I think 30% year over year. And obviously Grand Theft Auto Online also reflects extraordinary engagement. We know the economic impact as we talked about our economic results, but the most exciting thing is we get a record number of people playing in the third quarter. That's what's really exciting.", "Turning to the NBA 2K league, the goal is to build the first professional sports league that's built on a professional sport. And we know that people love basketball. We know the NBA itself is incredibly successful and we think it's just a natural to build a league around video gaming that in and of itself will be a successful sport, a successful occupation for consumers.", "So we expect it to standalone and to be successful on its own and to be profitable on its own. We do think we do it right and will also help the NBA brand overall and it will help to NBA 2K brand. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Nowak", "The first one on GTA Online, you mentioned the record number of players and the strong monetization. I'd be curious to hear about how you're driving new players to come into the ecosystem? Are you still seeing growth in the number of people who are paying digitally? What do you think is driving that?", "And just talk about, some of the digital mechanics that you've used are going to bring new players into the ecosystem if that is the case? And then just going back to NBA 2K eSports, can do you just walk us through some of the business side signposts that we should look for whether it has the potential to sign streaming rights deals, sign affiliates, understanding the draft is coming, the combine is coming. Talk us through some of the business steps to happen as we get to the launch? Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "I appreciate it. We're focused on players not payers. We're focused on captivation and engagement and we get that right, everything else will follow.", "In a way we get it right, it's continuing to give people what they want which is great free content and that's a strategy of Rockstar Games that done it just remarkably well which is why the game remains so successful and it's such an important part of consumer culture. So the focus is on the players and on the player experience and the modernization will take care of itself if we do that right.", "On the NBA 2K league, some of the business drivers that you will be interested in to hear about naturally are sort of how the draft turns out, where those teams look like? How the first season go? How are the games actually look? How did people feel about the experiences and naturally and purely in the business side what are the media rights look like and what a sponsorship looks like and all of that is you know information to come.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with the Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Ben Schachter", "We've got a few questions, one for Lainie and two Strauss. We are doing modeling for next year, how should we think about the potential of cannibalization of GTA online and Red Dead, anything in particular we should be thinking about?", "And then Strauss two things, one it was reported today that Google! is exploring some type of streaming service. And I understand you guys go actually platform agnostic but how would be entry in misleading platforms in fact how you think about the business? ", "And then secondly, when you think about the scale of the business versus some of your larger competitors, do you think you can optimize margins at your current scale or do you think you need an acquisition or potentially merging someone else? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff", "I'm actually going to take the point on cannibalization because I addressed it before. We think every game and every entertainment experience stands on its own. And entertainment experience competes - internally it competes externally and it competes with unrelated experiences because entertainment is want to have activity not a must to have activity.", "To the extent that there were a competitive threat one would assume that competitive threat is realized by properties outside of our company first and foremost and so far Grand Theft Auto Online is just doing phenomenally well we are having another record year. So we think these titles standalone and Rockstar Games is continuing to support Grand Theft Auto Online and the results reflect that.", "I\u2019m not going to comment on any particular news or potential launch expect to say that our policy is to support broad distribution because we want to be where the consumer is. That said, it is important that everything we support is consistent with our creative approach and with our business model and we\u2019ll look at it through that lens.", "And finally in terms of margins we have seen our margins grow. They grow with success the mortgage we have you noticed of course the higher our margins are if we have pure hits the lower our margins are. And of course as we grow scale as long as we grow that scale and maintain the same profitability levels, you\u2019re going to see our operating profits go up.", "So could gross margins go up, yes they can as we shift more to digital distribution which I think we\u2019re all saying and actually heard our gross margins go up and our operating margins will also go up. Our scale will help us achieve that. We have shown an ability to grow scale meaningfully organically we see it as challenged to continue doing so and we\u2019re balance and determined to meet that challenge equally accretive acquisitions that build scale when that truly act in service of higher operating margins as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Ray Stochel", "Big picture question, how should we be thinking about companion apps within your business for your two major labels and do you view companion Apps as a standalone revenue generator or more as something that is just the way to drive engagement back into the base game? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff", "I think what we\u2019re seeing with WWE SuperCard and with the NBA is that mobile games have standalone has great experiences and that\u2019s how we\u2019re focused on and I think the days of companion Apps for marketing purposes or even engagement purposes perhaps are gone and every offerings of consumer has the standalone powerful offerings.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Hickey", "See if I can ask this correctly, Strauss thinking about the Battle Royale they\u2019re obviously two major incumbents here - Fortnight and you looked similar mode I guess within GTL line that I think has gotten some success. I am just curious how you see the market opportunity to overall for new entrants and also if you feel that sort market offer [indiscernible] to Asia assuming you have PC based here and I have follow up?", "Strauss Zelnick", "I think more detail on game mechanics specifics really comes at the label level but I would just observe that someone else's success is really interesting and we\u2019re obviously informed by what our competitors do. But our goal is to be as innovative as possible and title you don\u2019t really titles that are derivative never seem to do as well as innovations that Ron expected.", "So when we came out with the first Red Dead Redemption the conventional wisdom was that Western\u2019s don\u2019t work and have been awfully long time since our Western theme video game had come out and Rockstar took a massive creative risk and the result was extraordinary.", "So I don\u2019t see our labels being super excited about being derivative. That said of course, we play in the world and we're informed by what's going on. And it is our job to bring consumers what they want.", "And because you are eluded to Asia, Asia remains an enormous area of focus. We've built a great business in Asia and we continue to be very interested in growing our business in and outside of China.", "Mike Hickey", "The last question, obviously you have -- it appears to be a strong working relationship with WWE also appears to some mutual respect there, for what it's worth.", "But when I am sure saw when Vince announced the relaunch I guess of the XFL, there appear to be certain eSports being and it was my impression on the watching the video stream and of course you guys have history long time ago now I guess history of making a very respected football game.", "So I'm just curious how you think about the possibilities of creating a football team, new sports angled into the launch of XFL?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, we have an enormous respect for the entire WWE Organization. We're thrilled to be in business with them. And you know if Mr. McMahon is going to pursue a new venture, we're rooting for his success enthusiastically, whether we\u2019d be fortunate enough to gain an opportunity from that remains very much to be seen.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Evan Wingren with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.", "Evan Wingren", "Just two quick ones, just to clarify on the buyback, reviewing that is more opportunistic or is that something that we should assume, as more of a regular contributor in terms of the go forward, given the visibility you have into next year?", "And the second question just with the additional time for Red Dead, does that potentially change your perspective in the near term about potentially porting the game to additional platforms or was the move perhaps not related to that at all? Thank you.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Well, we we've said that there are three potential uses for our cash balance supporting organic growth which is really our bread and butter, supporting organic growth which has been necessary lately as we acquired Social point and we are interested in potentially broadening the enterprise in that way and returning capital to shareholders which obviously we've just done with a meaningful buyback.", "We'll continue to pursue all three buys and when they make sense. So there's no change in our strategy. And in terms of Red Dead, any announcements about platforms for it will probably come from Rockstar Games.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Tim O'Shea", "Yes, thank you for taking my question and congrats on another great quarter. So on Red Dead, can you walk us through the decision to delay Red Dead for a second time?", "Is this a case of wanting to add some final polish to the game or are you reworking game play just love to hear your thoughts? And what\u2019s the level of confidence in the October 26 release date?", "And then, just curious how the holiday launch window compares to spring, how you think about the competitive environment or holiday spending? Love to hear your thoughts guys. Thanks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "We've said repeatedly, we've put our money where it matters and the entire focus of this organization is on delivering high quality entertainment experiences of any kind. And more often than not we feel proud that we're able to do that.", "All of our labels are focused on releasing the title when they reach that apex of effort and perfection. And in this instance, Rockstar Games thought more polish was required and naturally we\u2019re in favor of that decision. The date of October 26 is set, and I'm confident that will be the release date and incredibly excited about it. ", "We release titles all over the calendar. The only time we tend not to would be when it's super hot in July, but otherwise we've been in every other quarter.", "Heading into the holiday season can be a particularly powerful time and I had observe that even though there are some competitive releases it\u2019s a lot more open field today than it was say 10 years ago. There is plenty of opportunity to go around, so we\u2019re really excited about both the launch and the timing related to the launch.", "Tim O'Shea", "And then just one more if I may. You guys have now raised you full year outlook every quarter or year you\u2019re guiding to over 2 billion of revenue, $3.23 of EPS at the midpoint. And my question is just at high level how much of this is truly recurring I mean how much might we expect to get back next year and I know you previously said and you reiterated in this release that the fiscal 2019 revenue could exceed $2.5 billion but we\u2019re already at 2 billion this year with a very light release play and next year we have two major game launch just it were in this year\u2019s plan. So just love to hear your thoughts on how much you think is truly recurring? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff", "It\u2019s a great question. We haven\u2019t given any color on fiscal 2019 apart from what we said already naturally in the coming months we will do so and we\u2019ll get a bit more granular about it. You\u2019re absolutely right that we use the phrase for current consumer spending but nothing is forever where typically nothing is forever.", "And we have to show up and create new content for consumers for every experience that we offer them and not everything always goes perfectly. We are having a great year we had a great number of years we are mentally grateful for that that is all driven by the creative quality of the work done by our labels.", "And while we hope that will continue and so far we have been very fortunate you\u2019re absolutely right to imply this is not recurring in the way say interest payments on the AAA rate of municipal bonds are good recurring.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Doug Creutz", "It looks like you lowered your operating expense guidance for the year by a few tens and millions of dollars. I was just wondering if how much of that might have been due to the Red Dead 2 delay and potentially lesser marketing campaign for that in this fiscal year? Thanks.", "Lainie Goldstein", "The majority of these lowering of the OpEx is due to the timing of the marketing campaigns and it is for Red Dead Redemption but also some of our other title.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.", "Drew Crum", "So Karl just want a point of clarification, did you say the NBA E league will launch in May and if so my understanding was this was originally suppose to start in the fall so if that\u2019s true why the change. And then separately L.A. Noire is test case on the Switch can you talk about the prospects or opportunities with other games on the Switch such as Grand Theft Auto you\u2019ve got a 90 million base of players at this point? Thanks.", "Karl Slatoff", "So yes, we\u2019ll take the NBA league. It was never intended for launch there was no change May is our launch date and that\u2019s when we plan to do it. So that actually just to clarify that was not a change, and start to bring other titles to Switch. Obviously we\u2019ve done a few titles already we done NBA, WWE, L.A. Noire and we look at this like any other platform opportunity to extent that we look our development cost this again right for the platform what is audience look like what is the install base.", "So when we do believe that there is an opportunity to do something on Switch then you\u2019ll hear from the labels and we are impressed with the growth. We are impressed with the units that have been sold into the market so far. So we\u2019re very sanguine at this point but we have nothing more to announce specifically at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.", "Brandon Ross", "Two questions, first on GTA Online how should we think of the pacing of content releases this year should we expect it to be similar to what it was last year and will that at all be affected by the coming release of Red Dead. And how if all you\u2019ve intend to use that GTA Online funnel to drive Red Dead Cells and players in Red Dead Online.", "And then another Fortnight-related question, Fortnight has been pretty successful with a free to play strategy, especially with return consumer spending being what it is. Do you see a big opportunity in free to play on console, thanks?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks. We don't really talk about paid single content and I'm not even sure we really think about it that way. We create great entertainment experiences and when they're ready, we deliver them to consumers and so we don't have any kind of metronome quality till the creation of any of our entertainment experiences here.", "Rockstar Games has the intent to continue to support Grand Theft Auto Online and that supportive Grand Theft Auto Online has nothing to do with the launch of Red Dead Redemption II. These are different projects and they stand independent of one another.", "In terms of my own views on free to play console, I think there are potentially opportunities there. We have a free to play experience in China, NBA 2K online in China. It's a PC experience. Certainly it could be a console experience and naturally when people are involved with our online games, in many ways, those look like free to play experiences, yet you have to purchase titles, but if you are involved years later, it's hard to imagine that there is much difference between the emotional caliber of that experience and free to play experience.", "If your question is whether the business model moves in that direction, I would say it probably can't because in a free to play environment 10%-ish of your consumers maximum are paying you and that's not going to support the very significant investment that a AAA title requires here and in our competitor's shops.", "And we think consumers understand that and I think to the extent people want to continue to have big AAA experiences and they do, there are prepared to pay what ultimately is very little price given the massive number of hours that one can spend enjoying the titles.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.", "Andrew Uerkwitz", "I just have two quick ones here. Strauss, when you look back at GTA, I doubt that anybody internally through it had quite the success it's having now. It's been a record quarters now four years later.", "Is there one or two things that you guys look at as you put money more in quarterback, that you think has been the difference that's made this title what it is and then if so, how do you guys think about translating that to future titles across the portfolio?", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thank you for the last question today. It's hard particularly like ending on a high note. I don't think there's much of a magical answer to the question. Of course we ask ourselves that. It's just further recognition that the best quality wins and in the case Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online I have to hold myself back from over-promoting because it's not our style.", "But I do think that the title became standard there for not just the generation, but in many ways for the modern video game business and in other past iterations of the franchise I think there were potentially couple of other extraordinary titles that cost around competitively.", "And that hasn\u2019t seem to have been the case here with 90 million units sold and record result for Grand Theft Auto Online four years after its release. Is there a secret sauce? Yeah, the secret sauce it's a really ordinary experience that people love and was created and delivered and now supported by a label that never ever rest of the past and is utterly focused on innovation and breaking barriers with an eye towards an amazing entertainment experience.", "And that's easy for me to say those words exceedingly hard to do and I would argue impossible for others to replicate, but what we mostly feel around here is a sense of enormous gratitude to our colleagues at Rockstar Games for creating and supporting and delivering this experience or not with these very many years.", "And I suppose it is bad experience to please us to be so enthusiastic about the future when your strategy is guided by a true genuine appreciation for our mission which is to entertain people. And a genuine not financially driven commitments quality comes first it just comes first and then thankfully we run what we believe is a highly rationale exceedingly disciplined business environment which gives people who are creative a very safe place to do their very best work. Anyway that\u2019s our goal and we think that\u2019s why things are going pretty well.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.", "Strauss Zelnick", "Thanks so much for joining us today. We\u2019re really thrilled with the results of the quarter and incredibly pleased for the outlook for the remainder of the year and the early outlook for fiscal 2019. I want to thank you for joining us today and for your continued support.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
