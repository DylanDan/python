The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found either in the investors section of our website under webcasts and presentations or in the slides for this presentation.", "I will now turn the call over to SCANA\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Marsh.", "Kevin Marsh", "Good afternoon to everyone. I know many of you are joining us on the call today not only to hear our financial results for 2016 but also to learn more about the status of Westinghouse and the impact of Toshiba\u2019s financial challenges on our new nuclear construction project. Obviously we have been following the updates from Toshiba very closely and we will have comments for you on today's call. However before we get into that discussion, Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will provide you with an overview of our financial results for 2016 followed by Steve Byrne, SCE&G's Chief Operating Officer with an update on the construction of our new nuclear units. I will then conclude our prepared remarks with an update on Westinghouse and Toshiba before we move into our Q&A session.", "I now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks Kevin and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $0.87 per share compared to $0.69 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and favorable weather compared to the same quarter of last year. Results also improved due to increased gas margins primarily attributable to the implementation of rate increases at PSNC and SCE&G. These increases were partially offset by higher O&M and CapEx related items including depreciation, interest and property taxes. At the bottom of the slide you will note that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting in a positive $0.06 per share impact to earnings quarter over quarter. Slide 4 shows earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $4.16 per share compared to $5.22 per share for 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of two subsidiaries in 2015. During 2016, electric margins were higher due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and weather.", "Gas margins were also higher due to customer growth and rate increases. These increases were partially offset by higher O&M and CapEx-related items including depreciation, interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins in both years accounting for $0.19 per share in 2016 and $0.08 per share in 2015 resulting in a favorable $0.11 per share impact to earnings year over year. Now on Slide 5, I\u2019d like to briefly review the earnings results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G grew significantly for the quarter and the year due primarily to increasing electric margins from continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, weather and customer growth. PSNC also saw increases for the quarter and the year due principally to customer growth and a rate increase in November of 2016. SCANA Energy\u2019s earnings grew due to more favorable weather in 2016 versus 2015. Ignoring the impact of the net of tax gains on the sales of two subsidiaries in 2015 and their respective foregone earnings, SCANA\u2019s corporate and other results were consistent with the prior year.", "I would now like to touch on the economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. In 2016 companies announced plans to invest approximately $1.8 billion with the expectation of creating over 7,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Carolinas continued to be seen as a favorable business environment and we are pleased about the continuous growth in our service areas. At the bottom of this slide, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as December of 2016 and 2015. Over the course of 2016, South Carolina's unemployment rate has dropped a remarkable 1.2% from its level at the end of 2015 and it's currently at 4.3%. December of 2016 marked an all-time high for the number of South Carolinians employed and the number in the labor force. Additionally, the absolute number of unemployed is the lowest it's been since April of 2001. Of particular interest and attesting to our state strong economic growth, almost 70,000 or 3.3% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. The expansion of the labor force is evident of the confidence of some of the workforce to re-enter the market and the deposit migration to the state of South Carolina.", "The other states in which we have service territories, North Carolina and Georgia continued to see stable unemployment rates of 5.1% and 5.4% respectively. At depicted on Slide 7, United Van Lines recently released its annual Mover Study for 2016 which tracks migration patterns state to state. For the fifth consecutive year, South Carolina was a Top Five state for inbound moving. According to the study approximately 40% of these moves were related to jobs. Additionally, North Carolina has been listed in the Top Ten for the last five years. This study corroborates the customer growth which we have been seeing in our service territories over the past few years. On Slide 8 we present customer growth and electric sales statistics. The top half of the slide shows the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina each added customers at a rate of 2.9%. As you can see the rates trended fairly consistently throughout the year. The bottom table outlines are actual and weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to retail customers for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016. Overall, weather normalized total retail sales were relatively flat on a 12-month ended basis as we had expected when we provided our 2016 guidance.", "Now please look at - to Slide 9 which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $11 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The adjusted earned return for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016 in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 8% or higher. This mitigates the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition included a revision of disallowed ROE down to 10.5% for prospective request for revised rates which applied to the request that went into effect at the end of November 2016.", "Under the terms of our most recent order, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective request for revised rates. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on our gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE we failed to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act. As you will recall, in mid 2016, we received approval for an annual $4.1 million revenue increase that was affective in November of 2016. As you were also aware we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for an annual $19 million revenue increase at PSNC Energy. That increase was effective on November 1, 2016. Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect the company's CapEx projections through 2019. This forecast also reflects the estimate of new nuclear spending as derived using the construction milestone payment schedule approved by the dispute resolution board in December 2016. Although this information is the best available at this time it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.", "As you are aware, earlier this week, Westinghouse shared revised in-service states with us of April 2020 and December 2020 for units two and three respectively. Westinghouse has told us that it would provide the complete integrated project schedule supporting these dates to us for review. The CapEx forecast on Slide 10 has not been updated to reflect the impact of this revised project schedule. We will update the financial community on these changes after our review and evaluation have been completed. Now please look to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2019. This plan has been updated to reflect the estimated timing of expenditures inherent in the construction milestone payments schedule as well as the expected impact of the Section 174 income tax deductions which we discussed on the previous call. The expected cash flows related to Section 174 are presented in the table is top of the slide. These amounts reflect the total amount of state and federal taxes that would have been paid absent the 174 deduction treatment. As a reminder, since early 2015 we have used open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill the needs of our 401-K and drip plans.", "We currently estimate that will not have incremental equity needs until 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these debt and equity issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they are subject to changing in our funding needs for the plan project expenses and may change based upon the actual achievement of construction milestones and after consideration of the new schedule information that we will be receiving from Westinghouse. I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance and related assumptions on Slide 12. Our 2017 GAAP adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance range is $4.15 to $4.35 per share and our internal target is $4.25 per share. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 35% of this amount in the first quarter due to the demand in our gas and electric businesses, approximately 15% in the second quarter and the remaining 50% being roughly split between the third and fourth quarters. In developing this status, we have included the impact of electric rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA, the recent gas rate increases at SCE&G and PSNC. The impact of the 174 income tax deductions and the related estimated decrement rider as well as our current views regarding electric average use and the economy. This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier, but does not incorporate the new schedule information that we will be receiving from Westinghouse.", "We forecast electric customer growth to be approximately 1.5% offsetting our assumption that customer average use of electricity will be lower in 2017. Therefore we anticipate overall weather normalized retail electric sales growth for 2017 to be relatively flat. We expect consolidated operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 4% higher in 2017 compared to 2016 actuals. However, due to an integrity management rider approved in the 2016 PSNC rate case and a pension expense rider at SCE&G only about 1% of this amount will not be offset by incremental margins when compared to 2016 total O&M. amount. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx related cost of property taxes, depreciation and interest. Additionally, we project an effective tax rate of approximately 31% for 2017. In addition to providing this 2017 guidance we also resetting the base year for our long-term GAAP adjusted weather-normalized annual growth guidance to 2016\u2019s GAAP adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.97 per share. So our new long-term GAAP adjusted weather-normalized annual growth guidance target is to deliver 4% to 6% growth over the next three to five years using this base 2016 GAAP adjusted weather-normal EPS of $3.97 per share. Hopefully this will provide you with a line of sight into our view of 2017 and beyond as you update your models.", "Now please turn to Slide 13. Earlier today we announced an increase of $0.15 in our annual dividend rate for 2017 to $2.45 per share, a 6.5% increase which is consistent with our prior commitment to grow dividends generally consistently with long-term earnings growth. Our Board of Directors also approved an increase in the upper band of our payout ratio from 60% to 65%. We continue to anticipate growing dividends fairly consistently with earnings.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks Jimmy. At first like to know that Westinghouse no longer has any modules either structural or mechanical left at the CB&I Lake Charles facility. Everything has either been completed, moved to another fabricator or is being completed at the VC summer site. On a non- construction note, we now have 22 operators for the new units who have passed all portions of their Nuclear Regulatory Commission license exam, a process that takes several years. We anticipate having over 40 licensed operators prior to fuel load. Moving on to some activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the construction tabletop from December of 2016. I've labeled both units two and three as well as many other areas of the construction site to give you a general layout of the area. If you look closely in front of the Module Assembly Building which is labeled MAB you can see structural module CA01 attached to the heavy lift derrick or HLD. At the time of the photo we were preparing to place it in the unit three containment vessel.", "Slide 15 presents a schematic view of the five large structural or CA modules that are located inside the containment vessel. We have placed all of the major CA modules for unit two. We have previously placed CA04. 05 for unit three and more recently placed CA01. We'll discuss that more shortly. I'm pleased to say that all sub-modules for the remaining unit three structural modules are on site. Slide 16 shows an aerial view of the unit two Nuclear Island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and most of the previously mentioned structural modules as well as the steam generator which was placed in January. Outside of the containment vessel, you can see exhilarating building module CA20 and the shield building which surrounds the containment vessel. At the top left of the slide, you can see the containment vessel ring 2 before it was placed on top of the first ring section last weekend.", "Slide 17 shows pictures of placement of the first of two steam generators for unit two which took place last month. The steam generator weighs approximately 1.5 million pounds, measures 20 feet in diameter and that's more than eighty feet long. Steam generators transfer heat from the reactor to convert water into steam needed to spin the turbine. Slide 18 shows pictures of the placement of the containment vessel ring two for unit two which as I previously mentioned was placed this past Saturday. This component was fabricated on site and is approximately 50 foot tall, 130 foot in diameter and weighs over 2 million pounds. There's one more ring section to be placed for the containment vessel before capping it off with the upper bowl. Slide 19 shows some aerial view of the unit three Nuclear Island. You can see that the CA01 one CA05 and CA20 structural modules, CA04 also has been placed but it\u2019s not visible in his picture.", "Slide 20 shows the placement of the aforementioned unit three CA01. This super module was placed in the Nuclear Island in December of 2016 and will house the steam generators and pressurizer as well as form the refueling canal inside of the containment vessel. Slide 21 is a photo of the unit 2 Nuclear Island where you can see the shield building panels being placed. We\u2019re currently working on the fifth course of analysts and have 143 of the 167 panels needed to complete the unit 2 shield building. Slide 22 shows the placement of the first shield building course for unit 3. A panel for this course have been welded together and have been filled with concrete. We currently have 78 of 167 panels for the unit 3 shield building. Slide 23 presents the unit 3 module CA02. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the in containment refueling water storage tank. All of the sub-modules have been up ended and welding is complete for this model. Slide 24 is a photo of the unit 3 CA03, this is west wall of the in containment room refueling water storage tank. Ten of the 17 needed sub models have been up ended fabrication in the community and the remaining seven sub-modules are onsite.", "Slide 25 shows one of the accumulator tanks for unit 2 that was set inside of the Nuclear Island in December of 2016. There are two accumulator tanks for each unit and both of these tanks for unit 2 have been set in place. They're used to inject buried water in order to rapidly reestablish core cooling and are part of the path of safety systems. Slide 26 shows pictures of the unit three comparing December of 2015 to last month. As you can see we've made significant progress in just under 14 months. Slide 27 is the unit 2 turbine building where good progress is being made. Visible the top middle is the yellow overhead bridge crane which was recently placed. And we're now setting roof trusts. Slide 28 is the lower half outer shell for one of the low pressure turbans. There are six of these for unit and all six of them place for unit 2. Slide 29 shows a picture of the Sanmen plant in China. We have had our personnel involved in hot functional testing at Sanmen unit 1. And we've gained valuable experience. Additionally, we have recently participated in start up readiness inspections at the high on unit 1. We anticipate start up and operation of both of these units this year.", "This completes my update on construction, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin to discuss the situation with Toshiba.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks Steve. I would like to direct your attention to Slide 30. We continue to monitor Toshiba's financial situation and their proposed recovery plans. Although ideally Toshiba would be without the stresses we still anticipate completing two new nuclear units which will enable us to provide our customers with safe reliable energy for decades to come. As previously mentioned in our press release Westinghouse officials told us earlier this week that they along with the Toshiba remain committed to completing the construction of these units. As Jimmy mentioned earlier we also received new in service dates from Westinghouse and we will be reviewing the corresponding integrated project schedule supporting these dates once they provide it to us. After our review and once we've completed our evaluation, we will make you aware of any changes or implications information may have. This would most likely take place during our first quarter 2017 earnings call.", "While we are pleased that Westinghouse and Toshiba have reaffirmed their commitment to completing the project, we continue to look for ways to mitigate project risk for our customers and shareholders. If for any reason Westinghouse exits the project. We will evaluate the facts and circumstances at that time to determine the most prudent action for our company and customers. However we have already initiated steps as identified in our original EPC contract to assist in the only transition to a new construction team and assist in the continuation of construction activities. If necessary, in December of 2015, Toshiba\u2019s credit ratings slipped into speculative grade which triggered a provision in our contract requiring Westinghouse to establish a surety bond in the form of a letter of credit which can range up to $100 million. Additional, we initiated a contractual process to escrow intellectual property and software for the AP 1000 design. Should it become necessary having access to the AP 1000 design and software and the ability to call on the letter of credit would assist with a transition to a new construction team. Under this scenario we could evaluate options of serving as a general contractor, entering into a new EPC contract for the remainder of construction or entering into a procurement and construction contract and supply the engineering support our sales or through a third-party engineering firm.", "As to the end of 2016, all major equipment has been procured, received onsite or is in fabrication. Additionally, our amended EPC contract requires Westinghouse to begin paying liquidated damages to SCE&G and our project partner Santee Cooper to cap out at $676 million based if the construction goes beyond August 2019 and August 2020, guaranteed substantial completion date for the new units and our current EPC agreement. As you can see from Steve\u2019s update, we are making substantial progress on these new plants and remain focused on continued progress toward their completion. Again, we will continue to monitor this situation closely and will alert you if we are made aware of any changes.", "That concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] First question comes today from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "So I wanted to just follow up a little bit a lot of - I imagine a lot of questions her around it, but first just a little bit of an update of worker productivity to the extent which you have a sense. Given the new timelines released obviously recently what's your level of confidence against these timelines particularly given some of the risks around further delay on the second unit. Do you have any sense of that?", "Steve Byrne", "This is Steve, when you say that the second unit, you\u2019re talking about the second new unit or you\u2019re talking about unit two which is\u2026", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "The second new unit and the 2020 deadline.", "Steve Byrne", "So what we\u2019ve seen so far is that the efficiency factors have increased significantly unit 3, our second new unit. In some cases it's a matter of hours, in other cases it's double or triple the efficiency factor for the second unit. So we're learning the lessons from the first unit and applying them to the second unit and it's going much, much more smoothly. So I have a reasonable confidence in the efficiency gains for the second new unit. What we're doing with the schedule now is we're taking the assumptions that Westinghouse took in their schedule that they gave to us when they gave us the new dates on Tuesday. And we\u2019re evaluating what those assumptions are and what kind of efficiency numbers are in there. We do think that they have to increase their performance while increase the efficiency factors and they've got some plans laid out to do that. So we're going to be very interested to see it, as Kevin pointed out we're going to be going through that schedule over the next month or so and we got to be able to report out our level of confidence in that probably the next quarterly call.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "And to be clear about what we should expect at the time of the next quarterly call relative to what you've reflected today, largely the increase as far as your concern is a capital cost increase. Correct? Related to capitalizing interest. ", "Steve Byrne", "When you say increase which increase are you discussing?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Simply the delay in the project itself should have some capitalized interest in equity cost that you would bake into the project cost I would imagine. And maybe actually to be very clear about this, I think previously you guys have to talked about a $10 million a month I think perhaps per unit of cost.", "Steve Byrne", "Julien, I think you\u2019re talking about what we would call the owners cost which we're not necessarily carrying cost what we're talking about is the amount of staff and the expenses that we have to accrue each month things like increased, NRC fees that kind of thing. But the bulk of it is going to be carrying the staff that we have to carry. So if what we're talking about is the short delays that we announced, I think it was Tuesday or yesterday relative to the schedule information that we got from Westinghouse, we're looking at numbers along the lines on one 100% basis about 12.5 million. In what we would call our ongoing onerous costs and of course those would be offset by liquidated damages which would start to accrue when they don't hit the existing guaranteed substantial completion dates of August of \u201919 and August if \u201820. So at a macro scale we think that as long as they can complete them in the timeframe that they've laid out, our incremental onerous cost should be more or less offset by the liquidated damages.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "So barring a change in how Westinghouse and Toshiba decide to move forward, but actually really isn\u2019t effective had changed for consumers as far as their realized rates are concerned.", "Steve Byrne", "We see very little change there.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Excellent. Thank you, I\u2019ll let someone else ask.", "Kevin Marsh", "And Julien just to be clear I think that 10 million a month that you were talking about earlier that we previously referenced was more unlikely our 55% share of the costs going back probably a year ago. So the costs have increased a little bit and what I gave recently was the 1100% cost numbers.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Travis Miller", "Got one non-nuclear question and one nuclear one. I\u2019ll start with a non-nuclear one, what electric customer usage growth. Do you guys have to hit over the next two years call it 2017, 2018 to hit that 9% earned ROE that you guys are targeting?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes specifically, this is Jimmy, specifically for \u201817 it's basically a wash in our plan between the addition of new customers as well as kind of the loss of margin from all customers just due to efficiency working through the system. I don't have a specific target in there for \u201818 but generally at that same level.", "Travis Miller", "[indiscernible] net zero type growth.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. It\u2019s not precisely zero but it\u2019s very close to as relatively flat.", "Travis Miller", "So that would be investing about at a maintenance type level ex-nuclear?", "Jimmy Addison", "Ask that again let me make sure I\u2019m following that part.", "Travis Miller", "So that would be investing at essentially a maintenance type level non-nuclear, so that rate base stays very similar.", "Jimmy Addison", "You see in our CapEx plans we got and SCE&G business which includes SCE&G Gas, we've got about 400 million a year, 466 at the peak in \u201919 and generally that is going - in electric side is going to be matched against the DNA that's occurring on the book basis, so no significant change in rate base.", "Travis Miller", "And then walk me through what a worst case scenario on the nuclear side might look like if you were to get to some kind of stranded cost type situation.", "Kevin Marsh", "Hi Travis, this is Kevin, let me take a stab at that. First of all it\u2019s difficult to speculate on exactly what the status construction would look like if they were to - if Westinghouse where the exit the house. If that were to happen, I would expect that SCE&G along with our partner Santee Cooper would go through thorough assessment of the facts and circumstances that time and make some decisions around what options we thought might be appropriate and then certainly engage the Office of Regulatory Staff and the Commission to determine the most prudent path forward. But in terms of what that construction could look like, first of all we've begun escrowing the 81,000 intellectual property and software to make sure we got access to design if we were going to be responsible for continue with the project. We've got to surety bond in the form of standby letters of credit in place to make sure we've got some liquidity to help us make an orderly transition to a new construction team.", "But with the construction team specifically, we could make a decision to serve as a general contractor, we could look at entering into a new EPC contract or we could look to find someone just to do the procurement and construction. So we would certainly consider all those kind of look at the last case option the abandonment provisions under the BLRA that's not something that's high on our list, we would certainly like to finish these projects, they are critical to us over the long-term and meeting customers\u2019 needs and the growth we expect to see in the state of South Carolina over the long term and even though Mr. Trump has talked about changing some of the rules that might be in effect on clean air regulation. I believe people will continue to be focused on clean air and as much carbon free emissions as we can. So we're sticking with our strategy and these plants are critical to do that. So we have to evaluate the circumstances very carefully and then figure the most prudent path forward.", "Travis Miller", "And then the abandonment clause in the BLRA, you feel confident that given this type of situation that's happened, it would still be valid? Is that right?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well I mean certainly it's never been exercised. The Base Load Review Act has been implemented for the first time with the construction of our projects. But the intent when that was written by the parties that drafted and approved it was to make sure if something happened that was outside of the ordinary course of business or some unusual circumstance would arise that investors would not be restrained in that investment. But what it assumes is there is a very thorough evaluation done and that our company along with the Commission and Office of Regulatory Staff would deem that to be the most prudent course of action. We're not advocating that, we're not saying we're at that point but it is one of the items that is on the list. If you go through the evaluation should Westinghouse decide to exit the project. But what we know at this point is Westinghouse and Toshiba have reaffirmed their commitment to finish the project. I think the presentations that Toshiba has made indicate that if they recognize that\u2019s their obligation and they are taking steps to try to shore up their balance sheet to be able to fulfill that. They were clear in their discussions with us earlier this week that they intent to finish the project. They are in the process of reviewing that schedule with us now, so they're taking the steps to indicate they're going to back up their commitment. So we are banking on that but certainly we're going to watch the developments very carefully as we go forward.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Byrd", "Wanted to discuss the abandonment provision of the BLRA. If the issues with the budget and the cost overruns are really driven by nothing changing to the license reactor design, but rather more ordinary course scheduling issues overruns, and also the fact that Toshiba may not be able to meet its financial obligations, is that under the abandonment provision? Is that a cause for being able to get recovery for the money spent to date?", "Kevin Marsh", "The provision is not specific as to exactly what it would cover. There was not an effort to make a listing of the types of items it would qualify. It's more specifically focused on what would be deemed prudent at the time that decision was made and that clearly means in the regulatory space that they would have to be a meeting of demands and in serious evaluation of where the project is, where it might cost to complete and then jointly make that decision is to the most prudent action. It would be extremely difficult not knowing all the facts and circumstances to try to list what would or would not qualify under that provision. And generally prudency is the rule that commission banks on at the end of the day.", "Stephen Byrd", "Okay, understood. And Toshiba had laid out, I think, a little over $6 billion charge. Do you have a sense for where the budget is at the moment for the project overall? I know from your perspective you have protection on your EPC contract, but do you have a sense for where the budget estimate is based on your conversations with Toshiba and Westinghouse?", "Steve Byrne", "This is Steve, I'm not sure that we have a handle yet on what the budget estimate, of course we are focused on them performing now under a construction milestone payments schedule. So they had a milestone than they get paid. What we don't have is some of the details around what kind of contingencies that they have and the impairment that they announced. So that's something that we would not have direct line of sight over. So I couldn't give you an exact budget if you\u2019re talking about the Westinghouse portion of the budget. You might have to ask them but you know from our perspective we're focused on the construction milestone payment schedule. And then from June of 2015 we had about 6.082 billion to go.", "Jimmy Addison", "Stephen, this is Jimmy. Just to supplement they have represented to us obviously that covers all of their US projects ours and those in Georgia and they have represented to us as Steve alluded to that it does include contingencies and reserves we're just not sure of the levels of those et cetera.", "Stephen Byrd", "Okay, understood. And lastly, quickly on Sanmen, you laid out the status update here. I think the prior update was that Sanmen was going to be operational in 2016. Do you have a sense for the cause for the delay into 2017?", "Steve Byrne", "I'm not sure I have a direct line of sight on all of the causes and now when they went through hot functional testing they discovered a few things. So they've got a couple of equipment issues that they have to rectify. But I don't see those as large holdups. And for example we made available some bolts that they needed for one barrel that they asked for us this month. So this is something we don't need till 2017 for our trailing units. So we're glad - sorry to 2018 for trailing units, we're glad to give it to them. But we fully anticipate that they'll load fuel shortly they'll start up this year.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Kamal Patel", "I had two questions. One regarding the progress on summer. Where do you stand? Do you still stand in a position where you've made advances? Or are you where you aren't making advances anymore?", "Kevin Marsh", "On the construction milestone payments schedule, are you talking about Kamal?", "Kamal Patel", "Yes.", "Kevin Marsh", "We received an order from the Dispute Resolution Board late last year and as of December we are now making payments strictly under that construction milestone payments schedule. So we don't have any catch up payments to make if that's what you asked.", "Kamal Patel", "Okay. And there's no reverse catch-up work that Westinghouse owes to you under that payment schedule?", "Kevin Marsh", "No.", "Kamal Patel", "Second question, there's plenty of other what-ifs on the Summer, but with regard to the dividend increase, it's above what you did last year. I'm wondering what the premise was behind bumping it up above what we saw last year, given the headlines we're seeing around the project itself.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes. It's really being consistent and transparent with what we've said before, which is we're committed at this point to growing it fairly consistent with earnings. And you've seen an increase in earnings projected for \u201917 that's actually slightly above the dividend increase. So that was the consideration.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides", "Yeah. Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess one question for Kevin, you talked a little bit about the letters of credit, but can you quantify just how much has been set aside and did I hear correctly that the max or the maximum is around $100 million dollars or the letters of credit and the postings that you\u2019ve vesting out, could that be a bigger number to help do the bridge in case there's a switch in contractors?", "Kevin Marsh", "Under the contract, there is a form that we go through based on previous month's construction totals and we have in place now the 45 million, the max end of that form is around 100 million. So that is formulae in the contract we have in place today and don\u2019t have any expected changes in that as of today.", "Michael Lapides", "Got you. Okay. And the other thing is, what is the timeline. When do you need to get the projects put in service and we saw the detail in the BLRA filing earlier this week about the potential change in schedule. When do you have to get them in service to ensure you qualify both for the production tax credits and for bonus depreciation and does that date differ from either of those?", "Steve Byrne", "Michael, this is Steve. For the production tax credit basis, we have to have them operating by 2021.", "Jimmy Addison", "And generally, it's the same for bonus, but recall that with the 174 strategy that really neutralizes as a great deal of the bonus advantage, so that's booking even in advance of --", "Michael Lapides", "Okay. So in the situation, there are already pushing unit three out, assuming the schedule they submitted holds and what's in the BLRA filing. Assuming Unit 3 is December of 2020, if that pushes out another couple of months, sometime between now and then, it's conceivable that unit wouldn't qualify for PTCs", "Steve Byrne", "That possibility exists. There are a couple things. There are yet undefined relative to or untested relative to qualification for production tax credits. One is, what is the definition of in service, because certainly we\u2019ll be making some power from those units prior to declaring it in service. So if making power qualifies them, we\u2019ll be ahead of those dates. So that just gives us a little bit more room probably on the older two months. And the other thing that we're looking forward to is the opportunity to see if we can get an extension on the dates for the production tax credit qualification because all of the basic tenants around the establishment of what those production tax credits are there do still exist for both our project and for the southern company project.", "Kevin Marsh", "And Michael, this is Kevin. I'll add one piece to that. I certainly can't speak for Westinghouse and Toshiba, but I am comfortable repeating what we saw in the translation of their Q&A after they did their preliminary release the other day. And in their comments, they were asked about the loss and how that attributed to the efficiency of the schedule worked, it was structural work that was being done at the plant site and what they said in that release in my words was that PWC was very conservative and looking at that schedule calculation and that they would not allow them to include in that, any projected improvements in productivity. ", "So I would assume from that that the schedule they've got is based on current productivity rates which we know from discussions we've had in the past have not been ideal. That's been a primary area of focus for them. Fluor has been on site for a year now and I believe they've identified opportunities for improvement. So to the extent they can find those improvements and I would expect that to improve their overall schedule and possibly give us more comfort around those dates, certainly that December date for 2020 is pushing up against the deadline, but I just wanted to pass those comments on from the Toshiba executives\u2019 feedback to those questions in Japan earlier this week.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. And one final, just actually on the core business on the gas side. Should we expect you come in to the regulators and ask for incremental gas revenue increases at SCE&G over the next year, year-and-a-half or so, just given the earned ROE levels and do you anticipate kind of every other year or so rate case filing on the PSNC side?", "Steve Byrne", "Michael on South Carolina, we don't have a litigated hearing. We've got a process that just measures that at the end of March of each year and if we're over 150 basis points, there's an adjustment. Those are usually very small, we have one this initiative that\u2019s about 1%. So we don't have anything in our plan right now for one this coming fall and November of \u201917 but really the results at the end of the heating season will help determine that. And on. PSNC, I think we're generally in the three or so year, three to four year timeframe for rate cases in that environment with the rapid expansion that's there now. And if you'll note, our CapEx forecast over the next three years compared to the current rate base, we're looking at CapEx additions of about 75% percent of the existing rate base in that business over the next three years. However, about half of that is covered in new revenues either through the integrity management rider or through direct industrial contracts. So that helps mitigate the need for frequency of general rating for instance in North Carolina.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Andy Levi", "Hey, guys. How are you? Thank you for taking my call. I really appreciate it. Just to understand just a few nuclear questions. Just on the fixed cost contract, is it focused more on productivity. Is that -- as far as what covers you? Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?", "Jimmy Addison", "Sorry, Andy, the fixed price option, we looked at productivity when we were renegotiating the contract and really wanted to take that out of the equation. So, the fixed price option really affords us the protections and gives us what the prices going forward almost regardless of the productivity, such that if they don't improve the productivity numbers, then they're hurting themselves. And I think we talked about a little bit earlier that the real downside liability for us might be our owner's costs should there be an extension of the schedule and as of right now, we think that the liquidated damages would about offset what those owner\u2019s costs are anticipated to be. But the fixed price option really was from June of 2015 when we started the discussions or when we had the last good information, when we started the discussions. From that point to the end of the project, they gave us a fixed price which was $6.082 billion. That was the to go price. Really, that was the price regardless of the efficiencies. Now, we're very interested in seeing them make improvements in the efficiencies. Certainly Fluor has done a number of things to improve the efficiencies. But they've certainly got plans to improve it even more going forward.", "Andy Levi", "Now, if there are design issues that the NRC has concerns with. Is that covered under this fixed price contract or not?", "Kevin Marsh", "In the fixed price contract, it's a change in regulation. They would then be entitled to submit a change order. One of the things we worked very hard at was ironing out the definition of change in regulation. So it now has to be a written change in the law or the regulation. So it can't be anything about interpretational things, but if it's a basic tenant of the design that the NRC just doesn't think they're living up to, that on would not qualify for a change order.", "Andy Levi", "So, just as an example, there was an article on Monday. I'm sure you've read it about the neutron shield block. And I guess is there design issues. I don't know if I'm saying it right, but that there were some hearings I guess going on at the NRC, that\u2019s one example. What would that fall under, if there was an increased cost or there was, it had to be much smart enough, but not redesigned, but you understand what I'm saying. ", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah. So that's an issue where there has been no change in the law or the regulation. So Westinghouse would be obligated to make the changes to conform that shield block without passing along any increased cost to us. So that's a thing that they found during the functional testing at Sandman. And it's an issue of neutron shield block there, the material that was made of was getting too hot under the ambient conditions. So what they had to do was they just had to redesign it to use a different material which they've already done. So that one really is not as big a deal as it has been made out in the press I don\u2019t believe.", "Andy Levi", "Okay. So basically if the design is -- wasn't constructed properly, they're on the hook for, it's only if there needs to be some change in design because there's some regulatory change and thinking I guess for no better way to put, is that \u2013", "Kevin Marsh", "Not just the change in thinking, Andy. It has to be a written change in the law.", "Andy Levi", "Written change. Are there other hearings going on at the NRC. As far as other design issues going on currently?", "Kevin Marsh", "There are meetings on design issues going on at the NRC all the time. I'm not aware currently of anything that is looking like a change in law or the regulation that would force a change that we would be responsible to pay for.", "Andy Levi", "Okay. And just two more quick questions. I know like with Southern Company, their letter of credit expires every year and then it has to be renewed and administered provisions around what happens if the banks decide to pull that letter of credit, is that similar as your letter, again it\u2019s much smaller your letter of credit, but is it similar with you guys?", "Kevin Marsh", "It's an annual letter, but it has an auto renewal that runs through late 2020.", "Andy Levi", "Okay. And whose choice is it to terminate that letter of credit every year, yours or is it the banks or both?", "Kevin Marsh", "The banks could choose to do it, but they've got to give 60 days' notice and we have the right to draw on it immediately at that time.", "Andy Levi", "Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s an interesting provisions. And then my last question is, in a bankruptcy situation for Toshiba, do you just become another creditor or do you have some type of status?", "Kevin Marsh", "I'm not a lawyer. This is Kevin. But through our investigation, there are just a lot of different scenarios under which that can take place and it's difficult for us to speculate without knowing all those individual facts and circumstances but we continue to watch that closely and I we had a belief they were headed in that direction, we would take whatever steps we felt were appropriate to protect our project and our customers.", "Andy Levi", "And then I guess in that scenario of Westinghouse would default or not be able to complete the project, you'd have to find not only another contractor, but another engineer, right, because that's really what Westinghouse is doing or you would do the engineering yourself.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah. Andy, there are options there. Certainly, we couldn\u2019t do the engineering ourselves. We could go out and another EPC contractor. E in EPC is engineering. The other options are similar to what we did when we did this December, Unit no 1, we acted as a general contractor, had one company do the construction and we actually brought in another company to do the engineering. So there are a variety of options out there. There are different models in the marketplace and all of them have worked.", "Andy Levi", "Okay. That's great. And then I assume the NRC takes part in that too and kind of gives you a blessing on that?", "Kevin Marsh", "NRC is not necessarily in a position or responsible for giving us a blessing on who is the constructor. Obviously, the NRC holds us accountable for the construction and the quality.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Ashar Khan of Visium. Please go ahead.", "Ashar Khan", "Hi. Good afternoon. How are you guys doing? Can I just ask you one thing that came out if you can help me a little bit because you could probably understand the slide [indiscernible] put out two days ago? So they said, the biggest change came from labor. And they said, it was actually -- what they had concluded in labor versus now what they believe the labor cost are, it\u2019s humongous number. You probably saw that slides to your team. Could you just tell me what went wrong from your point of view in terms of their calculation of those labor costs, which were exponentially higher than what they thought plan to be? And I just wanted to get, I don't know, if you can provide some color from -- on that component of it?", "Steve Byrne", "Ashar, this is Steve. We don't know exactly what is in all of their numbers and sometimes in the presentation from Toshiba, they kind of lump things a couple of broad categories. So there may be some bleed over in different categories, but I can tell you what they have informed us about at the Westinghouse level on the labor piece. One, they are going to have to hire more people to do the work. And then secondly, where they have made some assumptions around what they would call unit rates or how many hours it takes for people to perform a specific task, those unit rates are increasing. So for example, they would say it'll take 5 hours to pour a cubic yard of concrete, what they're finding is maybe it takes 7 hours to pour a cubic yard of concrete So for every cubic yard of concrete and there is a lot of concrete, it takes two more hours than you're getting a significant number of hours increase, which from their perspective is increase in cost. ", "The other impact is what they've communicated is that when they acquired Stone & Webster, they made some assumptions about improving efficiency to the tune of about 30% improvement. And what we heard Toshiba say publicly during their call was that they have not seen those improvements. And as Kevin pointed out, Toshiba went on further to say that the scheduling information, the cost information that they put out, they have assumed no further improvements in that although they're pursuing improvements. So maybe it may have been an issue with the auditor, but they're not putting in the bank upon improvements in the cost numbers that they put out.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. So then can I just ask the process? So they will come in and give you some new backup to the new dates that they\u2019ve given, right. I'm assuming that backup, you will study with Fluor or Fluor has already blessed that thing or what? So I was trying to see the decision making process, who will it be involved, but is it going to be your, the SCANA to say, hey, this is right, not right or who's going to be part of that decision making process to whether that schedule is correct or not correct?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes. So the schedule information that we received so far has come from Westinghouse. They\u2019ve built that schedule with inputs from Fluor. So what we would look to do is we would look to do just to look at both aspects, we would look at the assumptions that Fluor made around things like unit rates, labor hours, labor cost. We would also then look at how Westinghouse has integrated all that information into the schedule. And the last piece is they've been performing density studies. And with a plant, even a big plant like we're building, there are limitations on how many people you can get into a specific area. So it's not as simple as understanding that a task now takes 100 hours if I put 100 people in there, I should get it done in an hour. If the room won't fit 100 people, then you cannot assume an hour. So we're going to be looking at all of those factors, we\u2019ll be looking at it in conjunction with Westinghouse and Fluor and we will have our folks doing it and then we'll more likely bring in some outside or independent help and we'll be looking at it in conjunction with our partner Santee Cooper.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. So you will bring some outside help. Okay. I just wanted to kind of. Okay. And then if I can change tact a little bit, Jimmy and this is on the financial results and I don't know if these slides that you provided us in terms of flip and spending, okay, this is the best information that we know right now, of course. Let's hope it comes up pretty close to what it is. Of course, your earnings are very formulaic, because of the BLRA mechanism. You go in, you get something accepted. It falls into place. You start collecting revenues. It's a very formulaic kind of earnings. You put in the number and earnings split out. So based on the incremental quip that you have produced in today\u2019s slides, doesn\u2019t the earnings and the math provide for earnings growth, which would exceed the 4% to 6% range in the next couple of years, just from the math of the quip that you have provided. I mean that's what the math tells me. I just want to find out whether I'm thinking to that correctly or there is some big hole in the whole assumption?", "Jimmy Addison", "Our view of the long-term guidance is that it's a view of the CAGR over a three to five year period. Any one period might fall outside of that range, I mean on the surface of the math for \u201917, you have done the math, you can tell that it\u2019s slightly above that range, but we're not -- we're giving you separate guidance for 2017 of $4.25 with a $0.10 ban on each side. We're giving a three to five year CAGR that we believe falls within that band.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. So you can have years, but it can exceed it, right? I\u2019m more talking about \u201918 and onwards, right? So what you're saying is, you want to keep the CAGR on a long-term basis but there could be years where the earnings growth could be higher than what is implied in the CAGR. Am I correct?", "Jimmy Addison", "You are correct.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from [indiscernible] with Wellington Management. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi. Could you tell me specifically what measures Fluor and Westinghouse can take in order to improve efficiency and your view on their ability to execute on that? Thank you.", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah, Chris. This is Steve. Work packages is one thing. They have been working for some time on improving work packages to make sure that folks that go to the field have what they need and they don't have to stop every time they run into a roadblock. So almost since Fluor took over, they've been working on improving the work packages. Secondly is, we\u2019ve had a lot of folks in the last year, I think Fluor has brought in 1200, 1300 incremental over the beginning of the year, but what we're focusing on now is ensuring that we bring in the right resources. So if I need welders, it doesn't do me any good to bring in fitters for example. So that's another thing that they're doing. We're looking at the possibility of changing the requirements on the secondary side of the plant or the Turbine Island side of the plant as opposed to the Nuclear Island or the nuclear side of the plant. So if I have requirements that are quality requirements that are nuclear grade, I don't necessarily have to apply those same standards to the Turbine Island or Turbine building side. ", "And to date, we really -- the contractors have been applying same standards across the site. So one of the things that they can do is they can change what the standards will be. So there's no reason for me to build a nuclear grade turbine building for example. I need a faster grade turbine building, because it's the same. And then lastly, one of the things I can do to improve efficiencies is increase their nuclear expertise and the leadership team, particularly where the critical path runs and right now, for both units, that's on the Nuclear Island side. So Westinghouse is going to focus on increasing their leadership team, their nuclear background, particularly on the Nuclear Island. So that's the containment vessel or the Shield building, Annex building, Auxiliary building and heretofore, we've had a lot of folks with a lot of good construction experience, but a little light on nuclear experience. So those changes are taking place now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. It doesn't sound like any of the stuff is insurmountable. It sounds like blocking exactly, so am I correct in assuming that you guys feel like efficiency improvements are readily achievable?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. I think the improvements that they've laid out to us are certainly achievable. Now, they've got to go out and get the expertise that they're talking about. They're at it right now. They're looking at all kinds of options and we are encouraging to include all kinds of options, including the possibility that we'll have Toshiba resources on the site. So perhaps folks from Japan that are actually doing work in the field, particularly on the trailing unit, so we're welcoming all of those changes.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins", "Hi. Good afternoon. So going back to the critical path, I noticed on your release on page 7 of the latest quarterly report, you laid out what the current critical path items are. So I was wondering if you could go through this like what the timeframe is for those items, like the -- are those -- what's the day for those items to be completed?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. Dan, for each unit, we run generally a primary, a secondary and a tertiary critical path. It's a series of activities that will culminate in finishing the unit. And as an example, when we were talking a year ago, probably even six months ago, the critical path for the first unit, unit two was the Shield building activity. So that was all of the activities, procurement, shield building, panels, delivery, installing them, filling with concrete and then moving incrementally up in the shield building. Shield building has now moved off critical path and that now runs through activities inside of the containment building. So the focus is really shifting more towards what we think it ought to be. So when we say the focus for Unit 2 has shifted into the containment vessel of building, we're talking about as things like setting up steam generators, reactor vessel, reactor coolant piping, the pressurizer, all the things that you would say form the heart and soul of a nuclear plant. So that's what we mean when we say that critical path has shifted to containment.", "With regard to specific activities coming up and completing, I think you probably saw that we recently completed setting of the reactor vessel. We set the steam generator, one of two steam generators for Unit 2, we\u2019ve set the second ring section for Unit 2. We should set the third ring section for Unit 2. We think in early second quarter, a number of activities mostly focused on Unit 2, but the next steam generator for Unit 2, so there's two per unit. We\u2019ve set one, we should set the other one in the second quarter and the pressurizer should go in in the third quarter. So there are a lot of big picture activities taking place this year and the next couple of quarters, particularly around unit number 2.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. So a lot of key items coming up in -- before mid-year it sounds like then?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes.", "Dan Jenkins", "Going back to your financing plan, I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on the timing you expect for 2017 for the financing.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. Dan, this is Jimmy. So we've got, estimated around 800 million there at SCE&G in debt to do this year and I would expect that probably more than half of that, we would do before the middle of the year. So sometime in late Q1 or Q2, we would probably do 500 or so of that 800 in the balance over late in the year.", "Operator", "The next question will come from [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, good afternoon. A couple of things. One, under the BLRA structure and everything like that. I know you guys are sensitive obviously to the rate of revenue increases and things of that nature. If it were mutually desirable for some reason, is it permissible to have deferrals underneath that and then like we\u2019re carrying charges and then recoup it post operational types of things and can those types of structures work in South Carolina, you will have these stuff like that?", "Jimmy Addison", "I would say, I don\u2019t know if you're familiar with our 174 tax strategy and the proposed decrement rider, but essentially that is the way we propose flowing that benefit back to the customer is to help offset some of these rate increases the next couple of years during the peak nuclear construction. So while we don't see any deferral or lowering of the BLRA amount itself, we intend to protect that process and let it operate as it should annually. We do anticipate that this tax strategy is going to allow us to offset the real impact on the customer\u2019s bill on a real time basis as we implement those increases.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And secondarily, you mentioned in your opening comments about having the ability to possibly engage another EPC entity or whatever. Can you give a sense as to given where the project is today, how large a universe of companies or vendors you have to evaluate or whatever, so we can think about it in terms of who you feel is capable of stepping in if need be?", "Steve Byrne", "This is Steve. I think the universe is relatively small. Obviously, the folks who would be in the driver\u2019s seat there would be Fluor. Fluor is a company now that\u2019s been onsite for about a year, so they\u2019ve probably got most of the new nuclear construction experience certainly in this country. There are other companies in the US that could do it, [indiscernible] and probably one or two others and then around the world, there are a number of companies that have recent nuclear construction experience, AREVA is another company that would come to mind, a French company, but certainly they have operations here in the United States and have a US wing, so they can actually do some of this construction. So, there are a variety of options available to us, a number in this country but worldwide, it's a much bigger field.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And also I think in an earlier question, you were talking about the various critical path activities that you have coming up here over the first half of this year and going forward. At what point, how close are you guys to getting to a point where the construction project is like now becomes a more traditional construction project. And if -- nuclear in and of itself is no longer like the defining factor in terms of getting from here to there.", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. I think we're actually pretty close to that. When you go through any major construction project, you do side press, excavation, we\u2019re through all of those. You discover things about the site that perhaps you can back where we're through all of that. One of our bigger challenges was the procurement as the nuclear supply chain went dormant for many years. We've had to stimulate that again. But the majority of the manger equipment is actually on our site, stored and the remainder of as has been fabricated and some of it's actually on the high seas as we speak. So I think by the end of the quarter, we'll probably have ninety plus percent of the major equipment on the site. We're actually starting to accumulate most of the valves, for example, we've got 5500. 5600 valves that go into this plant and I think we've got 5400 of them at the site. So from an equipment perspective, we're getting our handle on that. One of our bigger issues was the initial fabrication facility for structural modules. That was in Lake Charles, Louisiana. ", "That facility was problematic for us for a long period of time. We have divested ourselves from the facility, so Westinghouse no longer has any modules, structural or otherwise for Lake Charles facility. We have spun off other fabricators to handle modules and all those other fabricators seem to be doing a much, much better job of it. And Westinghouse is set to become accustomed to what it meant to build one of these plants under the combined construction and operating license framework that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has and we would call that a part 52 license. So you really have to construct it as it was designed. So that experience has been painful for the contractor and for us, but that experiences has been learned. I don't think that we're going to see quantum leap in productivity for unit 3, our second new unit. If we finish with the first one, we put the experience into our data bank and then we apply it to the second unit, unit 3. So most of those unique nuclear activities I think are getting behind us. ", "Now, we've got to focus on staffing the plant to the appropriate level with the right resources and bringing in leadership that understands what it takes to build a nuclear project and what the differences are between I\u2019d say traditional construction and nuclear construction. So when Westinghouse discusses bringing in additional nuclear savvy resources on the Nuclear Island, what they're really talking about functionally is a bifurcation of the site such that we acquired the non-nuclear standards to the non-nuclear portion of the plant and certainly Fluor has been very good at that. Even for us, Fluor has built non-nuclear turbines for us. They\u2019ve built gas plants and coal plants and other things for us. So with regard to your question a long winded answer, but I think we're getting to that point very rapidly, where the unique nuclear aspects and the unique aspects of this new regulatory framework are getting behind us. We've had challenges that you probably don't see in construction, even in things like getting our operator\u2019s license which is one reason I highlighted it in my comments upfront. But I would have to say that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is, they've been learning some things, but they are working with us very well to make sure that we have those licensed operators when we need them to load fuel.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I guess one last thing, it\u2019s probably for Jimmy. Have you had any discussions with the agencies in terms of how perhaps a more elongated and elevated construction budget and that type of thing might affect our ratings or might affect your financing approach going forward?", "Jimmy Addison", "We've had timely discussions with all three in the last week or so and really an elongated schedule doesn't really have an impact per se, because of the aforementioned tax regime. I discussed it's really, our ratios are in pretty good shape and all of them were fairly comfortable with that. The real issue that they are continuing to watch like we all are is just to make sure that Westinghouse is able to deliver on what they've said they will deliver on this week. The concern that the agencies have is the same ones that we have, which is that if they were to not honor those contracts, what would the potential impact be? So I would say that's the only issue not really on elongated schedule.", "Operator", "The next question is from Claire Tse with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi. Sorry. This is David. Sorry to sneak in a question at the end here, but just in your long term growth rate, are you assuming that the ROE on the nuclear project is reset to whatever the prevailing ROE is at that time?", "Jimmy Addison", "David, you might think of it as vintages, so whatever's out there today will stay at the rate that it is. So the vast majority that's in in rate base today is at 11%, the most recent increment was at 10.5, the increase, it was just effective a few months ago. And then those prospective being the first one would be the one we would file in \u201817 would be at the 10.25 and the ones thereafter would be 10.25, but there is no resetting of the prior.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So if I understand that then, it looks just hypothetically speaking 2021, both units are fully in service. The ROEs are -- are at more in pieces, not getting whatever the prevailing SCE&G ROE is in 2021?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right. So in the interim period, what I described is what's happened -- what happens at the end, it all goes into general rate base. There is no nuclear and non-nuclear rate base at the end. So it all goes into one rate base pot, you view that as, you see what the overall rate is and you would of course compare that to what the allowed is at that point and would give consideration to whatever the current market conditions are.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I understand. So really some rate case post 2021 assuming everything's in service. That's when you have just one ROE, allowed ROE for your entire SCE&G rate base, including the nuclear units?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's right.", "Operator", "The next question will be from Mitchell Moss of Lord Abbett. Please go ahead.", "Mitchell Moss", "Hey, guys. Just wanted to get a little clarification. On the slide 30, you mentioned in-service dates and in prior presentations, you've mentioned guaranteed substantial completion dates. Are those the same? In other words, is the guaranteed substantial completion date now April 2020 and December 2020?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. This is Steve, Mitchell. No, the days are not the same. The guaranteed substantial completion date is our contractual day and those are used to start the calculation for liquidated damages. So if the plants are not in service by the guaranteed substantial completion dates, which are not changed, then liquidity damages would start to accrue. The Westinghouse numbers that we've put out for the in-service dates, that's when Westinghouse has told us now they expect the plants to be in service.", "Mitchell Moss", "So in other words, if it goes sort of as planned from August of \u201919 for Unit 2 for instance, from August of \u201919 through April of 2020, liquidated damages will accrue?", "Steve Byrne", "Correct.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay. And for the purposes of the regulatory approval of the, I guess, the final regulatory approval beyond Westinghouse\u2019s in-service dates, is there additional testing or timing, anything else before the regulators will give its final approval I guess on this?", "Kevin Marsh", "Are you speaking of NRC or state?", "Mitchell Moss", "State. Yeah. Under the BLRA I guess, just to say that this project's effect would be completed. ", "Kevin Marsh", "The state regulation, the BLRA, when they grant us the venues in the first day up front, it includes the right to construct it and operate the plant. So we don't have to have another hearing at the conclusion to have it put in to service. We filed an estimate of the O&M cost, the depreciation, ex cetera that goes in and the last be already proceeding, but that's not a litigated proceeding.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay. But there doesn\u2019t need to be any type of an operating performance test for some of the amount of time post the in-service dates, anything like that?", "Kevin Marsh", "I\u2019m going to hand that back to Steve to talk about operator in our sleeve perspective, et cetera.", "Steve Byrne", "Yes. So contractually, as we put the plants in service, that means that they have to have passed a performance test. So yeah, they will not only have completed the plant, we will have loaded a few, we will have done our startup testing, but the plants have to be operating at or near 100% for a period of time where they can guarantee -- where they can prove to us that the output guarantee has also been met. So yeah, the plants will be up and operating by the time they claim substantial completion.", "Mitchell Moss", "Do you have an estimate of about what the period of time is?", "Steve Byrne", "From fuel load to substantial completion, there's about six months. And when Westinghouse is giving us their in-service states, that's a substantial completion date.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay. And then operating at 100% time, is that after substantial completion now?", "Steve Byrne", "No. The substantial completion, they have to demonstrate that the units are performing as they have told us they will perform. So then you don't have to actually have been at 100% and they have to run a test to verify that the megawatt output is what they guarantee that would be at 100%.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Marsh for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thank you. 2016, although not without its various challenges, marked another successful year for our company. We are very pleased with our underlying economic growth, the operation of our businesses and our financial results. We look forward to 2017 and continue to focus on the nuclear construction project as well as on operating all businesses in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 30, 2015. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Susan Wright", "Thank you, and welcome to our Analyst Call. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2015. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.", "During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and related matters, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other Investor Relations information directly to our Web site at scana.com. On SCANA's home page, there is a yellow box containing links to the new nuclear development and other Investor information section of the Web site. It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time to time may be deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. You can sign up for e-mail alerts under the investor relations section of scana.com to notify you when there is a new posting in the nuclear development and or other investor information section of the Web site.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. The required Reg G information can be found in the investor relations section of our Web site under Web casts and presentations. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Susan. And thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the first quarter are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, and higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. Also O&M presented a favorable variance, which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for one month.", "These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather, lower gas margins and expected increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes, and share dilution. Note that even though weather had a negative impact on earnings year over year, it was still abnormally cold and earnings increased by $0.05 per share in the first quarter 2015 compared to $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2014.", "Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $1.34 per share compared to $1.27 per share in the same quarter of 2014. This excludes the impact of abnormal weather and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI in the first quarter of 2015 of $1.41 per share.", "Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's first-quarter 2015 earnings were relatively flat when compared to the same quarter of 2014. However, exclusive of the previously mentioned impacts of weather, earnings per share were up $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 over the first quarter of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth, and a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses. ", "These items were offset by a decrease in gas margins, as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. PSNC Energy's earnings were $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2015, consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy, our retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed an increase in first quarter earnings of $0.03 per share in 2015 over last year. This improvement was primarily attributable to increased margins. On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $1.48 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.08 per share in the prior year. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted EPS was down $0.01 over the prior year. This is mainly attributable to lower interest expense at the Holding Company being more than offset by the foregone earnings contribution from the subsidiaries that were sold. I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory, on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over $600 million with the expectation of creating over 1,600 jobs in our Carolinas territories. Most significantly, Mercedes Benz announced plans last month to invest about $500 million to build a new commercial van assembly plant in Charleston, creating approximately 1,300 jobs. South Carolina continues to be seen as a favorable place to start and/or expand existing businesses. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G Electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.7% and the rate in SCE&G's Electric territory, is estimated at 5.6%.", "While the South Carolina unemployment rate has slightly increased over the past few quarters, March marked the 64th consecutive month of employment growth and the 14th consecutive month of labor force expansion, as the number of people entering the workforce is at an all-time high. Approximately 50,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slides are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Of particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated over rates a year ago. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were flat on a 12 month ended basis. We continue to see slightly lower weather normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies, which are offset by increases in industrial demand.", "Now please turn to Slide 8 which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.", "In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31 in the base electric business is approximately 9.6%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business we're allowed an 11% return on equity. Last year the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $561 million to our rate base, and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November. As Steve will discuss shortly, we will be filing our new revised request for rates in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns.", "Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the petition filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12, 2015. At the bottom of the slide we recapped the new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30, to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. As a reminder, in January we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning the plans off to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017 and currently expect we could satisfy future needs without follow-on offerings. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented, as they are subject to changes in funding needs for the planned project expenses. And we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Finally, on slide 11, we are reaffirming our GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next three to five years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to slide 12. I'd like to begin by discussing the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12. The petition is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the two new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2, and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost schedule includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contestant costs. As previously noted, negotiations continue with the Consortium and neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and or delay-associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved.", "I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 13 presents an aerial photo of the site from last December. Here, you can see the layout of the site.", "I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up the construction table top. The site changes daily, and for those of you that have been tracking the project for some time, you can see that progress continues to take place.", "On Slide 14, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture you can see module CA20 along with containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. Also visible in this photo are the personnel and equipment hatches which are located in the first ring section. Work continues on the containment vessel prepared for placement of CA01, which we will discuss shortly. Progress continues on achieving what we term elevation 100, as auxiliary building walls are being built up. Once elevation 100 has been reached, work will begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for the plant, as well as placing of the shield building panels.", "Slide 15 presents a schematic of the large structural modules that will be located inside the containment vessel. And here, you can see the locations of modules CA01, 02, 03, and 05, which we will further discuss shortly.", "Slide 16 is another schematic view of the modules inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA01 through 05 gives you a better feel of how they fit spatially inside said containment vessel.", "Slide 17 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA01. CA01 houses the steam generators, the", "pressurizer, and forms a refueling canal inside of the containment vessel. On the right-hand side of the photo you can see an arc flash from the automatic process that's seam welding the sub-modules together. This seam welding on all sub-modules in preparation for lifting has been completed in the module assembly building or MAB. Once support concrete has been placed and", "cured, the CA01 module will be moved outside of the MAB, rigged to the heavy lift derrick and set in the Unit 2 containment vessel. After the placement of CA01 for Unit 2, the next module to be placed will be module CA02. ", "Slide 18 shows a picture of CA02 as it is currently being fabricated. We now have all five sub-modules on site with three standing upright for assembly in the MAB. Module CA02 has a wall section that forms part of the in containment refueling water storage tank located inside that containment vessel.", "Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the auxiliary building walls continue to take form. On the left side of slide 20, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building. And I've added an arrow showing where the construction is taking place for the turbine pedestal. On the right, you can see a picture from the top of the turbine building of the turbine pedestal. The turbine pedestal will be concrete 10 feet thick, and will support the Unit 2 turbine when completed.", "Slide 21 shows some of the shield building panels that have arrived on site for Unit 2. The shield building surrounds the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together and concrete will be poured inside of the panels to create the shield building. On the left, you can see one of these panels up close. On the right, you can see the lay-down yard where we have been receiving these panels. We currently have received about 60 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that were manufactured by Newport News Industries.", "On Slide 22, you can see where we have begun assembly of the shield building panels. Once joined and welded together, panel sections will be placed starting at elevation 100. ", "On Slide 23, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of the construction. This chart reflects our company's current, actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020; reflecting petition filed March 12 with the Public Service Commission. As you can see, the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA, and is associated with the right hand axis. Please now turn to slide 24. We have two BLRA filings coming up in May. In mid May we will file our quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And as mentioned earlier, on May 29 we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. ", "Finally, please turn to slide 25 to briefly discuss our solar initiative in South Carolina. Our customers and other South Carolina stakeholders have expressed a desire for solar energy, and we've been looking for ways to economically integrate additional solar into our generation portfolio. As a part of the Distributed Energy Resource Program, which was filed with the Public Service Commission in February, SCE&G plans to add approximately 95 megawatts of renewable energy by the end of 2020. In 2015, we plan to install approximately 10 megawatts of solar generation to our system. As you can see from the slide, the first two solar farms will be a 3.8-megawatt solar farm in Cayce, South Carolina, adjacent to our corporate headquarters, and a 500-kilowatt solar farm that will be constructed in North Charleston, South Carolina. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction] The first question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar.", "Travis Miller", "Good afternoon, thank you. I'm going back to the previous CapEx estimate for the 2015, 2017 from the previous quarter. Looks like the delta there is about a $250 million or so on the new nuclear?", "Jimmy Addison ", "Right.", "Travis Miller", "Is that part of that $698 million such that the balance of the $698 million would be post 2017? Am I getting that timing right there?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's correct.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. And then how much cash did you get from the CGT and SCI sales that could go into offsetting that equity?", "Jimmy Addison ", "It was a little over $425 million, Travis.", "Travis Miller", "And now, like you said, you plan to use as an equity investment to fund the CapEx?", "Jimmy Addison ", "Right, over time. It will take us the next couple of years to fully utilize that through displacing otherwise planned equity.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Weinstein of UBS.", "Michael Weinstein", "Just wondering if you could give us any update or color on how the negotiations are going with the Consortium?", "Steve Byrne ", "Michael, this is Steve. I think the only color I can put around it is they are ongoing. The positive aspects are they haven't completely broken down yet. And we always would reserve the right or the opportunity for other dispute resolutions down the road, whether that be arbitration or litigation. But as of right now, we're still in the discussion phase with the Consortium. Obviously arranging schedules with our executives has been challenging, but we haven't given up on the negotiation discussions. And we feel that there's an opportunity for a settlement in the future.", "Michael Weinstein", "If there is no settlement, what is the other alternative? Is it litigation?", "Steve Byrne ", "The contract has in it a variety of dispute resolution provisions. Arbitration is one of those, but litigation would be the ultimate one.", "Michael Weinstein", "Okay. I was wondering if you could go over a little bit more about your strategic plan for solar. How much rate base potential is there going forward? Are there new initiatives, new legislative initiatives, that might expand that even further? Are you going to be going outside of the state at all, expand beyond your borders?", "Steve Byrne ", "Michael, this is Steve again. As of right now, the legislation in South Carolina is through Act 236 and that will be restricted to the state. Our current plans do not take us outside of the state borders. As of right now what we're looking at is -- it works out to be like 2% of peak load, and so that works out to somewhere in the 50-megawatt range of industrial-scale solar. And roughly 50 megawatts of nonindustrial or residential commercial scale solar. So that's what our goals are from between now and about 2020. What we've outlined here are the first of the projects that we have planned. Now, whether we own those up front or not will be a question, and right now we're not thinking that we will own those necessarily up front. Other entities can take advantage of things like tax credits that we are not able to take advantage of. I think eventually we will probably own them. We also have about 300 or so customers on our system right now with solar, all relatively small commercial and residential scale, in addition to about a 2.3-megawatt facility we have down at Boeing . Now we do anticipate that we'll end up with somewhere in the range of 5,000 commercial and residential customers after 2020 through this state-approved program.", "Michael Weinstein ", "And when you say that eventually you think you'll own them, you mean after the five-year period after the ITC?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, I think so. We'll have to see how the tax legislation plays out, but that's our current thinking anyway.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jim von Riesemann from Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hello, Jim.", "Jim von Riesemann", "How are you?", "Jimmy Addison", "Great, how are you?", "Jim von Riesemann", "I'm okay. I've got three questions, if you don't mind, so one question three parts. First one is, your trailing 12-month earnings on a weather-normalized basis of $3.62. How do you get to the midpoint of your range of $3.60 to $3.70, so you guys hit your $3.70 target?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, $3.60 to $3.80 with a $3.70 target, right. So the way we get there is through customer growth and through the growth in rate base, which is driving the BLRA increases. So those are the two main contributors.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Can you explain it's okay thank you. Second question is can you explain why the nuclear rate base has stayed flat for the last three consecutive quarters at $2.667 billion? I'm looking at your pie chart on page 8.", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I can't off the cuff, Jim. That doesn't sound rational. I'll have to check on that and follow-up.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. And then my last question is, with this petition that you're supposed to put in later this month and at the end of the month, will you ask specifically for the special petition and then normal the BLRA filing to be consolidated? Or is that something that the regulators will have to do? And part B of that question, is that a function of the status in negotiations?", "Steve Byrne ", "Jim, this is Steve. The two proceedings before the Commission will stay separate. Remember that what we file for in May is a trailing 12-month, so it's what we've actually spent and really does not have anything to do with what we're proposing going forward. In large measure, what we're asking for with the update petition, and again we expect a hearing in the July time frame and an order in the September time frame, will be on forward-looking. So that's money we", "haven't yet spent. But it's our best projection to date as to what we will end up spending on the project. So those two will stay distinct and separate.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. And then I guess the last question is related to PTCs and what you might think might happen with nuclear PTCs. I know you're coming up against the time clock and I noticed today that DTE press release was a little bit skittish, but they're putting in for a new nuclear plant. Is that part of the PTCs network? Would that take away from the PTCs that you guys have applied for?", "Jimmy Addison", "I think DTE applied for a combined operating license for another nuclear facility some time ago. And I think the press release today is around successful culmination of that process for them.", "They will not qualify for production tax credits, because you had to have your license issued by a date certain. We're past that date certain, so that will not change the production tax credit basis for us. We believe that, I think it was outlined in our filings, that we will actually be qualifying for more production tax credits than we had originally anticipated in our original filing. So that's a positive aspect. We fully anticipate that the Consortium will be able to bring the plants in by June of 2019, and June of 2020 for the second unit. So the production tax credits, you qualify for them by having the plan in service before the end of 2020. So while I'm not satisfied with only having about six months' margin, we do believe that there are some opportunities, particularly on that trailing unit, or Unit 3 for us, to bring that in a little bit earlier.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides", "Hey guys, congrats on a good quarter. A couple of nuts and bolts questions. Jimmy, can you give a little more clarity about what happened year over year in O&M? Was it at one of the utilities? Or was it just losing the O&M related to the businesses you sold?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, well there's a little fluctuation in all of the business. There have been pay increases earlier in the year for the employee base across all of the businesses, et cetera, some minor inflationary increases with outside vendors. But the most significant change would be the two months of CGT O&M not being in there. That's the most significant one.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. And also, when you look at O&M for the year relative to last year at both SCE&G and", "PSCNC, what are you expecting in terms of growth or kind of growth rates?", "Jimmy Addison", "If you look at it on the face of the financials with the GAAP O&M as reported last year to include the two businesses we've sold, we would expect them to be down for the face of the financials of 2015 compared to 2014, in the 1% to 2% range, because you don't have the O&M for those two businesses for the majority of 2015. If you strip those out from the prior year related to those two small businesses, then we would expect it to be up maybe 1%, something like that, but fairly close to flat. Apples to apples.", "Michael Lapides ", "Got it. So traditional utility O&M, flat to up 1%?", "Jimmy Addison ", "Yes, that's our expectation.", "Michael Weinstein", "Understood. Last question, just real quick. When do you think -- I know you're trying to avoid it -- when do you think you'll have to come in on either the SCE&G gas or electric side? Maybe looking more a little bit at the gas side, given the earned ROE there is a little lower than what it is on the electric?", "Jimmy Addison ", "On the electric side, our strategy continues to be to do everything we can possibly do to stay out of a base rate increase, other than the BLRA increases each year, during these peak nuclear construction years. So that hasn't changed, and we've defined our internal goal of staying above a 9% return to be able to achieve that. On the gas side, we've got the Rate Stabilization Act in South Carolina which measures it each year, so at the end of the heating season, at the end of the first quarter. And of course the numbers we disclosed there for the gas business were at 12/31. But once they settle out that and make the pro forma adjustments, the Office of Regulatory Staff will review it. And if it's more than 50 basis points either way off of the 10.25% allowed return, there will be a recommendation to the Public Service Commission that rates be adjusted. For example, last year, we were above the allowed return by more than 50 basis points, so there was a small rate decrease of ballpark $3 million. And that same measurement will happen this year.", "Michael Weinstein", "Got it. One other item, real quick. SCANA Energy. Anything unusual on the positive side in the quarter? Or is this more of a return to normal and last year was a bit of abnormal?", "Jimmy Addison ", "Well, the main difference is in 2014 we worked very hard to work on the costs of our storage gas that's there. With the weather that had been there the last few years and the embedded price of that, we weren't able to use a lot of that storage to fully respond to the current market price. And we were able to move through a lot of that higher-cost gas in 2014. That's put us in a better position to use that storage to be able to compete in 2015. So we're in a much better position now.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Mitchell Moss of Lord, Abbett.", "Mitchell Moss ", "Hey, guys. I just wanted to get your views on the importance of being investment-grade at all three rating agencies for your Holding Company, for SCANA Hold Co. And particularly having an investment grade rating at Moody's.", "Jimmy Addison ", "Well, it's critically important at the Operating Company, where we expect to issue a substantial amount of debt the next few years. Most of the organizations have a linking methodology, so that they are going to ratchet down the HoldCo slightly less. It's clear that, especially with the extended period of construction for the new nuclear plants, that it's going to be difficult on some of the metrics to maintain some of the current ratings at the Operating Companies. And that's likely going to put more pressure on those. If those were to change, then by methodology it's probable that the HoldCo ratings could change as well. So it's possible those could slip slightly below investment-grade at the HoldCo, but we expect that the OpCo would be able to maintain the investment-grade ratings.", "Mitchell Moss ", "So in other words, you don't see any need to be investment-grade at the Holding Company?", "Jimmy Addison", "I wouldn't say we don't see any need to. It's a matter of juggling everything we have to juggle, and running the Operating Company at reasonable equity levels that the regulators will endorse. There's only so much we can do with that. The real strain on the metrics is the longer -- although the BLRA is a very effective mechanism, all it allows us to do is to recover the financing costs during the construction period. We're not recovering the actual construction cost of the plants until they start depreciation. That's when we get the recovery of the actual cost of the plants. So the longer that period is drawn out with increased cost of the plants, it's going to put more pressure on the cash flow ratio. So I wouldn't say we don't think it's important. It just may be very, very difficult to do with juggling all of the factors we have to juggle.", "Mitchell Moss ", "So in other words, when Moody's has discussed that FFO to debt needs to improve above 13%, and RCF needs to improve above 8% or 9%, you don't see that likely happening over the next two years, based on how the BLRA recoveries are designed. Is that effectively what you're saying?", "Jimmy Addison ", "It's going to be a challenge, that's fair.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Andy Levi from Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Andy Levi", "Hi, good afternoon. I actually wasn't going to ask a question, but just interesting, the last question, so back to the question for me. Just to understand because SCANA Corp's BBB. So obviously you wouldn't defend that BBB rating, is that what you're saying if need be?", "Jimmy Addison", "I don't understand what.", "Andy Levi ", "I don't mean defend it verbally, I mean defend it financially. So if the BBB rating at SCANA Corp was in jeopardy, you wouldn't issue equity or come up with some equity to defend that BBB?", "Jimmy Addison", "We would have to look at the situation as we get there. But in the short run here, we've strengthened the balance sheet a great deal in one quarter with the $400 million-plus of cash we brought in. So it's significantly stronger today than it was 90 days ago. What we've got to do is move through the project, see how these negotiations go, see what the schedule looks like, and respond dynamically during the situation. But I can't say that in every case, we would issue additional equity just to keep that bond rating at investment-grade at the HoldCo.", "Andy Levi", "Okay. And just to understand, because I guess I had a different impression. Maybe I'm just misinterpreting, but the sale of the pipe, was that to defend the rating? Or was that done because it made the most economic sense? Or a combination of the two?", "Jimmy Addison", "It was actually done for strategic focus on our retail businesses. The by-product was what I was", "mentioning earlier, in the short run here has strengthened the balance sheet substantially. But it was really about focusing on retail business, which is core at what we do. So everything that's left in the portfolio is about being focused on those retail businesses in these three states.", "Andy Levi", "Okay I'll discuss it with you next time I meet with you. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tim Winter of Gabelli & Company. please go ahead.", "Tim Winter", "Good afternoon, guys. I was wondering if you could update us on the development of the Sanmen units over in China. What the target completion dates are there and if there's any issues that we should be aware of as it relates to summer.", "Steve Byrne", "Tim, this is Steve again. I can only give you what our understanding is of the schedule at Sanmen. I can't speak for Sanmen, either the utility, the construction company or even Westinghouse. But our understanding is that they have made good progress, the plant physically looks like a complete plant. They would plan to go into production or be operational at the end of 2016. So they continue to be about two and a half years ahead of us and they are making good progress. The latest holdups for them, the reactor coolant pumps are probably two-thirds to three-quarters of the way through an extended engineering and endurance run, with no problems noted to date. So with that behind them, that should allow them to get into high drilling the primary side or the reactor cooling system side, which they hope to get to late this year. But I believe they've made very good progress there. I know they've been into flushing the secondary side of the plant, or the turbine building side. I think they've started the flush of the primary side of the plant, or the reactor side. We're heartened by good progress there. And our team will be making another trip to China, I guess in next week. So we'll be visiting China next week with a team that includes some members of SCE&G and Santee Cooper.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dan Jenkins of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins", "I just wanted to make sure that I understand correctly. I'm looking at your Exhibit 1 that you filed in March, related to the construction schedule at the nuclear plant, along with your slide 16. Just want to make sure I understand kind of the order here. So CA04 is already set, right? And then is the next thing going to be CA03 followed by CA01 and CA02? Am I looking at that properly?", "Steve Byrne", "We have set CA04. We've also set CA05. And then not inside of the containment vessel itself, but just outside forming most of the auxiliary building, is a module called CA20, which we set.", "So the CA01 is actually being fabricated. The weld-out is finished to the point where we could lift it. So we're just waiting for some concrete to be prepped and poured and cured inside of that containment vessel to set CA01. And then after 01, I think it's 02. So 03 is actually one of the later ones to set.", "Dan Jenkins", "So CA01, CA02 and then CA03?", "Steve Byrne", "Right, 04 and 05 are already set.", "Dan Jenkins", "Right. And then are those critical paths so that 02 can't go in until after 01 has been set? And 03 can't go in until after 01 and 02? Is that true or not?", "Steve Byrne ", "Yes, Dan, there is a definite sequence to it and 01 has to be next.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay.", "Steve Byrne ", "One is also constraining the lift of the second containment vessel ring section, just because of the height of that module.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay, that's the only question I had, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Paz from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. ", "David Paz ", "A question, is the settlement with the ORS and other parties in your pending new nuclear petition, possible absent a resolution with the Consortium on the costs and schedule?", "Jimmy Addison ", "Dave, I think we're certainly going to pursue that option, because right now we don't know when the negotiations might be concluded with the Consortium. We are going to pursue that with the Office of Regulatory Staff and other interveners to be settled, as in enter into a settlement agreement prior to the conclusion of the negotiations. Now, if the negotiations take a very positive turn and they're concluded, obviously that will impact how we proceed. But as of right now we're proceeding assuming that we will not have a settlement of the negotiations. And we'll be pursuing a settlement agreement with the Office of Regulatory Staff.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up from Jim von Riesemann from Mizuho.", "Jim von Riesemann ", "Hi there again, sorry about this. I'm just listening to the call. I'm getting a little confused, maybe you can help me out. So what's more important for SCE&G, is my question. Is it fixing the variable component, cost component of the contract? Or is it having the plants come online ahead of the construction timeline that the Consortium has proposed?", "Steve Byrne ", "Jim, I'm not sure that I would say either is necessarily more important than the other. We believe that getting the costs right is very important, but it's also critical to us to have the plants come online no later than when the Consortium says they can deliver them to us, which, from our perspective, is already late. So I don't know that I would say one is necessarily more important than the other.", "Jim von Riesemann ", "Okay, I'll follow-up off-line with you, thank you.", "Steve Byrne ", "Thanks.", "Jimmy Addison ", "Jim, let me follow-up on your earlier question that I did not know the answer to at the time, about why the $2.667 billion on the chart number eight hasn't changed. That chart reflects the amount of NND CapEx that's included in rates, in cash rates. So as we don't get new rates except once a year, the additional CWIP that's been incurred since the middle of 2014 that's earning AFUDC is not included in that chart.", "Jim von Riesemann ", "That's right, I should have known that. Sorry for asking that question.", "Jimmy Addison ", "I should have known too, sorry.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides ", "Hey, guys. Heard all of the commentary regarding the Holding Company credit rating. Just want to make sure, and I may have missed this. Have you guys either gotten commentary from the rating agencies but been put on some kind of watch? Have they made any proactive steps that would result in a downward change to the rating? And can you talk about if any covenant issues that would create or any cross entity-related issues something like that would create? Or even if it would have a material impact on your cost to borrow it?", "Jimmy Addison ", "Yes, Michael, at the HoldCo, we've had negative outlook with S&P and Fitch at BBB and BBB+. So there's room for a notch or two, respectively, in both of those and still remain investment-grade, obviously. And we're currently stable at Moody's. The only thing I was mentioning is that some of them, and frankly I don't remember which one right now, have -- and maybe most all of them even -- have these methodologies so that if the OpCo moves, the", "HoldCo has to move by methodology, by definition. We don't have anything other than that.", "I think they're all watching the outcome for the HoldCo just like they are on the OpCo of this very, very important filing before the PSC and BLRA update. So I think that is the key issue. Not aware of any covenant issue or anything like that would cause any additional concerns.", "Michael Lapides ", "But what about cost to borrow? Meaning, how do you think about what it does to either short-term debt or borrowing costs in general? You've got a lot of capital to spend. You've got a lot of debt coming to help fund that capital.", "Jimmy Addison ", "We do, and this whole conversation has been about the HoldCo debt. We don't have any additional new debt that we plan to issue at the HoldCo. I think there's maybe $500 million that would need to be refinanced at some point out 2019, 2020. That's well beyond the critical period where these ratios are going to be stressed. So we don't expect any incremental impact on borrowing costs at the HoldCo because, frankly, we don't plan to do anything for the next four to five years there.", "Michael Lapides ", "Got it. Thank you, Jimmy, much appreciated.", "Jimmy Addison ", "You're welcome. I appreciate the clarifying question.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison, Executive Vice President and CFO, for any closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison ", "Thank you, Andrew. The first quarter of 2015 has certainly been an eventful one from the successful closings of the sales of the two subsidiaries, to the petition filed with the PSC seeking approval of schedule and cost changes to our new nuclear project. We're very pleased with the results for the quarter, and we look forward to another successful year.

Thank you for standing by. My name is Maria and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Friday, February 15, 2008. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Betty Best, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Betty Best - Investor Relations", "Thank you Maria and good morning. I would like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. Earlier today, we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, 2007. In just a minute, Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review those results and respond to questions. The earnings press release that we will refer to in this conference call is available on our website at scana.com.", "I would like to remind everyone that certain statements that may be made during today's call, which are not statements of historical fact, are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed in the company's SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Betty, and good morning. I would also like to welcome each of you to our call. Earlier today, SCANA reported 2007 GAAP earnings of $2.74 per share, compared to $2.68 per share in 2006.", "GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations in 2007 were also $2.74 per share, compared to $2.59 per share in 2006. The 2007 GAAP adjusted earnings per share represent a 5.8% increase, compared to 2006 and we're in line with our guidance. A reconciliation of reported earnings to GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations, as well as earnings' variance explanations for the quarter and full year periods are included in our press release.", "$0.15 per share improvement in GAAP adjusted net earnings per share from operations, was due primarily to higher margins on sales of electricity and natural gas in 2007 and to charges in 2006 related to the FERC settlement. These positive factors more than offset higher operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes, and the lower synthetic few royalties related to the company's former subsidiary, Primesouth. The higher electric margin was attributable to increased kilowatt hour sales of electricity, driven by solid customer growth of 2.6%. The increase in consolidated natural gas margin was primarily due to customer growth of approximately 2% and rate increases at SCE&G and PSNC. As a reminder, we recorded charges in 2006 totaling $0.08 per share, $0.02 in the third quarter and $0.06 in the fourth, related to a settlement agreement with FERC.", "Reported earnings in fourth quarter of 2007 were $0.75 per share, up from $0.57 per share in the same quarter of 2006. The $0.18 per share increase in our earnings was due in part to higher margins on sales of electricity driven by customer growth and increased wholesale sales.", "In addition, earnings were higher compared to 2006 due to the sale of a bankruptcy claim related to a long-term pipeline capacity contract at Carolina Gas Transmission, and the 2006 fourth quarter charge related to the FERC settlement. These factors more than offset high depreciation property taxes and lower syn-fuel royalties in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Contrary to recent media reports, SCE&G has not suspended plans to submit a joint application with Santee Cooper to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission later this year for a combined construction and operating license. While we originally had plan to submit an application to the NRC by the end of 2007, we must continue to give due consideration to the rising estimated costs associated with nuclear plant construction, before moving forward with the supported decision.", "Our decision to delay submittal of our COL application should not impact the overall construction schedule if we go forward. We would still expect to bring the plant on line in the 2016 timeframe. This intentional delay in the application timing has allowed our nuclear team and the vendors to focus on furthering the negotiations on engineering, procure and construct contract. It is also allowing us the opportunity to revise our application based on feedback from the first few COL application submittals.", "I would now like to review our new three-year capital expenditure and cash flow projections, which are provided along with our earnings press release on the Investor Relations section of our website. SCANA's budget for capital expenditures totals approximately $3 billion for the period 2008 through 2010. Approximately 85% of that total or about $2.6 billion is for South Carolina Electric and Gas company's operations. Approximately $246 million is for PSNC Energy, principally for enhancements to and expansion of its natural gas system in North Carolina to meet projected demand growth. The balance of $202 million is spread across our other businesses.", "Looking at SCE&G's capital costs for the forecast period, $402 million is being projected to meet environmental requirements, including the installation of scrubbers at Wateree and Williams plants and notch reduction equipment in our coal plant. Another $857 million of capital was allocated to the new generating capacity, including $98 million for natural gas for our peaking capacity in 2011 and approximately $759 million, which represents SCE&G's share of a proposed new nuclear plant which if approved should begin construction in 2010.", "The balance of SCE&G's three-year capital budget of about $1.3 billion is directed primarily toward normal expenditures that will be required to meet the core-system growth we expect to see in the company's electric and natural gas delivery and support systems over the next three years. While SCANA's current CapEx forecast for the three-year period represents an increase of approximately $800 million from the prior forecast, a vast majority of this new investment is allocated to our proposed new nuclear generation, which will be included in additions to our rate base and subject to timely recovery under the Base Load Review Act.", "This strategy of growth through investment continues to be one of the key drivers of long-term earnings growth for the company, coupled with and reflective of the underlying core customer growth in our service territories. As mentioned earlier, the major unresolved component of this CapEx forecast is whether we build nuclear generation and at what cost. While we have included in the estimate of CapEx, we are still negotiating to ensure that our nuclear option will be economically viable. What we have included is our projection of free construction costs and some long lead time purchases. Once this issue is resolved, we will update you on the impact to our forecast.", "And now I would like to update you on our regulatory matters. In 2008, PSNC plans to file an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission for a base rate increase and to obtain approval of our customer utilization tracker for the company's residential and commercial rate schedules. Legislation enacted last year by the North Carolina General Assembly authorized the Commission to adopt this type of tracking mechanism in a general rate case proceeding.", "PSNC's test year for this case will be the 2007 calendar year. If approved, this utilization tracker will provide the company margin protection against declining average use per customer, should that trend continue. It would also retain weather protection for both the customers and the company, as the average consumption factor is based upon normal weather.", "In June of 2007, SCE&G filed an application with the South Carolina Public Service Commission requesting a 6.75% increase in retail electric base rates. That proposed increase was based on 11.75% return on common equity and would have produced approximately $118 million in additional annual revenues.", "In December, SCE&G received approval from the Commission for an overall increase in retail electric revenues of approximately $77 million or 4.4%. The company was allowed an 11% ROE. The increase... requested increased was presented to the Commission in October, as part of a settlement agreement reached among SCE&G, the South Carolina Office & Regulatory Staff and all other parties of record. The new rates were effective January 1, 2008.", "Since under our current law, the synthetic fuel tax credit program expired at the end of 2007. This is likely the last time, I will provide you with an update on our SCE&G's synthetic fuel tax credits. As you know, these credits have been implied to offset accelerated depreciation related to Lake Murray backup dam.", "Based on our analysis of actual and projected oil prices at the end of 2007, we have increased our estimated phase down of synthetic fuel tax credits for 2007 to approximately 67%. This is an increase from our third quarter phase down and is a reflection of the record high oil prices we saw during the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.", "Based on this phase down, we have recorded approximately $8 million in accelerated depreciation this year, leaving about $68 million of unrecovered investment. We will continue to accrue a carrying charge on this unrecovered balance, as authorized by the Commission and we will ultimately propose an alternative for the recovery of this investment, probably as part of the general rate proceeding.", "And now, I would like to update our earnings guidance for 2008. Consistent with our earlier statements, we currently expect that earnings per share in 2008 will be in the range of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. This guidance assumes normal weather in our electric and natural gas service areas and among other things, the full year impact of the electric rate increase, continued core growth in all our regulated jurisdictions, and effective tax rate of approximately 35%, reflecting the expiration of syn-fuel credits.", "Looking out over next the three to five years, we continue to target a long-term earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% annually. We obviously expect 2008 to yield earnings growth at the top and/or even slightly above this range. It's important to remember that this is an average annual earnings growth target, which means that in some years earnings may come in above the range, and in some year below. Our management team has always taken a long-term perspective on earnings growth. So our strategic planning process is focused on generating annual earnings growth that on average, will fall within our targeted range.", "Key earnings drivers for our company over the next five years will be additions to rate base in our regulated businesses, driven primarily by capital expenditures for environmental facilities and new generating capacity, and system expansion. Other factors that will impact our future earnings growth include a supportive regulatory environment, maintaining historical levels of customer growth in each of our businesses and maintaining appropriate control over the growth and operation and maintenance expenses.", "In closing, 2007 was a successful year for our company in many respects. From an operational perspective, we continued to experience consistent customer growth in our electric and natural gas utility businesses. Our generating plants performed safely, reliably and efficiently, especially during a time of record electricity demand by customers during the late summer.", "In our natural gas operations, SCANA Energy maintained its position as the second largest marketer in Georgia, and was selected once again by the Georgia Public Service Commission to serve another two-year term as the State's regulated provider.", "In our regulatory arena, we continued to receive reasonable and timely support in each of our utility jurisdictions. In South Carolina, we worked very hard with the Office of Regulatory Staff and other interveners to reach settlement agreements in several cases pending before the State Public Service Commission, including the increases in electric base rates. We also saw important legislation passed in South Carolina, with the Base Load Review Act, which allows for annual revised rate adjustments for CWIP associated with the nuclear construction.", "We created additional value for our shareholders by growing GAAP adjusted EPS by nearly 6% and increasing the cash dividend on our common stock by 4.5%. Continuing a pattern that has seen us raise the dividend rate by an average over 6% annually for the past five years. That concludes my prepared remarks. And, I'll now be glad to respond to any questions you may have.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Micheal Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hey Jimmy, congratulations on a good quarter and a great year for the company. Want to just touch on rate case timing. I want to make sure I got everything down that you mentioned in the call. So, SCE&G had its case in 07 that goes into effect in '08. When do you think you would file the next case for SCE&G. That's kind of the first question. Then on PSNC; your filling in 08, does that case go into effect by first quarter 2009?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Michael, thanks for your compliments there. On SCE&G's electric case, it goes into effect January 1 of this year. We've typically been on a two to three-year cycle and I don't see any real need for that to change as far as base rates here. So, I would expect something to fall within that range of two to three years. Obviously that's all needs to be considered within the context of what we do with new generation and how that coordinates with the Base Load Review Act fillings and we will try to coordinate those that make sense for our customers, for the commission, for shareholders et cetera. So, we will try to consider that in addition to it.", "At SCE&G gas, you didn't specifically ask for hourly based SCE&G. Recall, we have the Right Stabilization Act that essentially takes a snapshot each year after the winter heating season at the end of March, and takes a new snapshot of your rate base comparison to your earnings during the year and makes any necessary adjustments to bring us back to our allowed ROE of 10.25, if we are outside that range from more than 50 basis points. And with the growth we have here in the South, we are typically seeing that each year since the procedure was in enacted a few years ago.", "There is a smaller increase from that each year that's effective November 1 in the beginning of the heating season. Finally, at PSNC, we would expect to file the case about the end of the first quarter here this year and in accordance with the statute, we would have it effective before the begin of the heating season this fall in November 1.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. Thank you Jimmy, much appreciate it.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Your next comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch", "Quick question on your CapEx disclosures and any initial thoughts on what the recent court ruling on mercury and the EPA rule, could mean as it relates to how you plan to address the coal plants?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, as you can tell from our CapEx forecast, we have got what we think we need to have in place now to meet all existing legislation. We are not planning to build any new coal generation. So, our leaning is certainly towards nuclear. We have got a very enthusiastic state year, probably one of the strongest in the country if not the strongest, supporting nuclear. So, that's where our intentions are. We make it economically viable, but we are not aware of any direct impact on our company from the recent discussions.", "Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch", "So, your disclosures that you could meet the requirements with your existing plants, you still hold even if there is no cap in trade, I guess that's why, on mercury, specifically?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I'll tell you, what I have got Steve Byrne with me who heads our generation unit. Let me let Steve respond to your question.", "Stephen A. Byrne - Senior Vice President - Generation, Nuclear and Fossil Hydro-SCE&G", "I think the simplest way to answer question is that until we know what the rules are and what the regulations are, we are not going to know whether or not we can meet those rules or regulations. The rules that were proposed under the Mercury Rule in 2005, we felt pretty confident that we would able to easily meet those with the existing scrubbers that we are going to place on some of our largest coal units. That being basically struck, we don't know where we are going with it. So, we will figure out what additional components we might need to add to some of our clients, whom we find on what those rules are.", "Jonathan Arnold - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleischman with Catapult. Please proceed.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Partners", "Yes, hi. Couple of questions. First, what was the size of the bankruptcy claim gained in the fourth quarter? Was that about $0.04 because it's typically what you have -- typically on $0.02 in the gas transmission?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's right Steve, it's about $0.04 to $0.045 and that was two components. It was an interest component for the... since the time of the claim and it was also a couple of years of amortization and what we have done is we have taken that claim and are going to amortize it over the original life of the contract. So, we picked up I'll say two to three years work through the end of 2007 and the balance of that flow through prospectively.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Partners", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And amortization which will be slightly above $0.01 a share for the next 12 plus years. So, of course we got all the cash upfront.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Partners", "Okay. Did that mean you... just to clarify, do you have $0.01 benefit for year going forward?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's right.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Partners", "Okay, got you. And then, secondly any better sense of timing now on when we'll know on the nuclear filing?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You know that's a difficult question to answer, because it's like building a house when you think you're not 90% complete. But you don't really know until you are finished. It's a serious cooperative negotiations process. My best answer for you today Steve is, I would certainly hope it would be by midyear. And I am hopeful that will be even before that. But we are only one side of that discussion. And so, I really can't be sure about that.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Partners", "Okay. And then finally on PSNC. What did that entity earn on equity in 2007?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I believe it was around 8.5%. Just a minute, I've got it here Steve. Yes, it was about 8.8%", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Partners", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glen Rock Associates. Please proceed.", "Paul Patterson - Glen Rock Associates", "Hi. How are you doing?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good Paul. Hope you are.", "Paul Patterson - Glen Rock Associates", "All right. I wanted to just follow-up on the PSNC. What was the equity level that you guys have in it right now?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't have that with me Paul, but it would generally be in the... around the 50% range. But I don't know the precise number.", "Paul Patterson - Glen Rock Associates", "Okay. And then on the nuclear side, what are we looking at in terms of... could you give us a little bit more flavor as to how much the cost have risen?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, it depends on when you start from. They have... from our initial theoretical discussions, they've probably doubled. But that was really early in the process, before there was the lot of substance to it at all. And I guess what's really important is how do they compare today versus alternatives. And that's what's critical. The comparison against coal is obviously not just a financial comparison; it's an environmental comparison of public relations et cetera comparison. But we tend to model it most frequently against a combined cycle gas plant. And that's what's most critical to us is how does it compare today.", "Paul Patterson - Glen Rock Associates", "Okay. But could you give us sort of a flavor as to price per KW that we are now looking at?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, really in the spirit of the negotiations and that kind of protection of that Paul, I prefer to keep that to ourselves, until we can come out with the full plan for you.", "Paul Patterson - Glen Rock Associates", "Okay. But... then in terms of the CapEx projections that you got for 2008 through 2010, what kind of number are we... what was... what is that based on I guess, in terms of you said most of that's associated with the new nuke. What is the amount of the cost associated with that, that's embedded in that, I guess?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, qualitatively I'll tell you that a lot of it has to do obviously with the licensing, with construction, planning, engineering and designing. And then the initial parts of commitments for long lead-time equipments, if we were to sign a contract, site development work, and staffing, training things of that nature. But I really prefer not to get into any specific estimates of dollar per KW, that kind of thing at this point till we can bring back a package to you.", "Paul Patterson - Glen Rock Associates", "Okay, fair enough. But it's safe to assume that this CapEx number through 2010 has little to do with the actual cost of the actual plant. It's more to do with the preparation of the plant is that?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I would not say that Paul. If you look especially in the third year out. If you look on that schedule we have posted on the web there, in 2010 you see a significant uptick from the $120 million to $180 million range to two prior years up to $450 million. So we are starting this see some commitments there for long lead-time materials especially.", "Paul Patterson - Glen Rock Associates", "Okay. Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks a lot guys.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I wish, I could give you more on that and hopefully, we will be able to in the near future.", "Paul Patterson - Glen Rock Associates", "Excellent. Thanks.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Raymond Neuwalt [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Couple of questions on, given that you have a you've got to fairly sizeable CapEx budget, as well as looking at your short-term debt balance and that's pretty high rate now. And that should be attributed partly to working capital for gas. But can you go through a little bit your financing plans, your covered shortfall of your future CapEx budgets? And how does hybrid and equity plays into any debt financing?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, glad to. First of all, the short-term was up pretty good at year end, but within the first couple of weeks of January we did $250 million first mortgage bond deal at SCE&G to pull that short-term down substantially. We also have plans this year to do a medium term note deal at SCANA to basically refinance a couple of maturities that are out there. We got maturities that are in excess of $200 million. We'll likely round it up to about $250 million. That's essentially a re-fi deal there.", "And then, for the balance of the year our current plans are to do financings at... additional financings at SCE&G and at South Carolina Generating Company, mainly to finance the ongoing construction costs of the scrubbers, we've disclosed earlier and have been in our CapEx program.", "As to hybrids, we don't have any current plans for hybrids, but we will certainly keep our options open as we look at the development of the CapEx program down the road. And to really talk about equity, we've got to have more certainty to this whole nuclear issue. We've got to have that plan come together to determine if we need equity and if so, at what time.", "You can see that the Nuclear CapEx forecast is not substantial this year, the $121 million creeps on up to 180 next year. But the big hump is at in 2010. So when we come back to you with our full plan on nuclear, we expect to really be able to make some sense of the financing plan at that point beyond what I've told you earlier, which is fairly firm related to SCANA and the pollution control facilities at the SCE&G and GENCO plants.", "Unidentified Analyst", "All right, okay. And what's the timing of that nuclear plant? Again, I am sorry.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, my estimate is we'd like to be do by middle of the year, hopefully even before then. But it's a very involved negotiations process and we only control one side of that. So we'll be back to you hopefully in that timeframe.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right, thank you very much.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with SAC Capital. Please proceed.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Hi, Jimmy. One thing you mentioned is that at some point the nuclear might not become economically viable. Could you a little bit elaborate on that comment, what is it that that will make it economically unviable? At what level?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, there are at least two moving parts to that. And as I said earlier, our most frequent comparison in our models is compared to a combined cycled gas plant. So that's what we would model most often. But if both sides of that are moving at any one point in time based on your assumptions. What are your assumptions for carbon tax potential in the future? What are your assumptions for the cost of gas? Those kind of things make the... make the competition challenging. So it's really a moving target compared to your other alternatives.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "So, what do you think a combined cycle costs you right now? Can I ask you? In your models.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Roughly a $1000 of KW.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "So, of course nuclear is going to be more than that. So where does it become economically unviable, four times, five times or at what level?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I wish it were as simple as isolating it to the capital cost. But its not. You've got to try to assume what the cost of gases operate combined cycle plant. You've got to make some assumption around the carbon tax. You've got a lot of moving parts to that. So, it's not as simple as saying it's a 3X or 4X or 5X. And then of course you got to compare the lower cost of potential for nuclear fuel in the future. So, it's a very complex-modeling process.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Okay. So, can we say right now that, as you sit right now it is economically viable depending upon the final results that you'll get in the next three or four months. Is that the way you are progressing?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well we hope it is. I would say that the delay over the last few months has been over that very delicate balance.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Okay, okay. And then, if I can just end up going from 07 to 08, I guess should we take like this gain which Steve mentioned as being a one-time of at least 3% because you said $0.01 of it is repeating... going to be repeating for the next 12 years. So, like $0.03, $0.035 of it is I guess not repeating. Is that the way to look at it?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's right.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Okay. And then going from 07 to 08 to achieve the guidance. Is all the... majority of the earnings growth coming out the electric company, driven by the rate case? Is that where all the growth is?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Substantial amount is in the electric company. Of course, we had a down year in Georgia due to volumes, with a mild winter at the beginning of '07, a mild winter at the end '07. So everything else being equal in that market. And it's a dynamic market, but everything else being equal we would expect some growth over actual results in Georgia as well.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Georgia as well.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "And the gas company you said earns of course in SCANA. But PSNC, the impact of the rate case should be minimal right, because you said it's going to start in November right?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's right. For 2008 it should be minimal. Although November, December are a couple of the stronger months. But we would expect no more than a penny or two impact '08.", "Ashar Khan - SAC Capital", "Okay. I appreciate it.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please proceed.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Hi, good morning.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Actually Paul started to ask my questions on nuclear, but I'll follow-up real quick with an additional one. Can you give us a good idea of where you are seeing the biggest cost increase in the nuclear construction, seeing in materials, in components and labor, the biggest coming from?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Let me let Steve respond to that.", "Stephen A. Byrne - Senior Vice President - Generation, Nuclear and Fossil Hydro-SCE&G", "Good morning. The biggest increases that we are seeing would impact any form of new generation of that we would look to cite. They are basically commodity driven. Things like concrete, steel, copper; we are seeing significant increases in last few years and on the price of those. Those would impact any form of generation.", "But we are also seeing some increase in the labor market and what our vendors are anticipating are the potential for attracting labor to these projects and what do we take to keep that labor on the project.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Okay, so in your forecast through 2010, are those costs that you are forecasting, are those the ones that are volatile at all. It sounds like some of the costs that you are saying are most volatile are the ones in maybe 2011, 2012.", "Stephen A. Byrne - Senior Vice President - Generation, Nuclear and Fossil Hydro-SCE&G", "That's correct. The ones that we are forecasting for the next couple of years, really are fairly well nailed down. We just need to... if you want to get a plant cited out in the online in 2016ish timeframe you really need to order a long lead materials now. So, a lot of the costs that we have got for those long lead materials and are placing orders for the long lead materials. So, you get your place in line with the forgers.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Okay, what are some of those long lead materials?", "Stephen A. Byrne - Senior Vice President - Generation, Nuclear and Fossil Hydro-SCE&G", "Things like reactor vessels, steam generators.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Okay. Great, thanks a lot.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, just thinking about the electric side at SCE&G. Even though you've got the rate increase, it appears that in 08 you will have slightly higher O&M costs. You will have higher financing costs as you fund your CapEx program. Are you concerned about your ability to actually earn your allowed levels of returns and how much is AFUDC as a component of the total expected earnings out of SCE&G in 2008?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, Michael. Well, first of all AFUDC in 2007 was about $20 million. If you'd include in that definition, the carrying cost that we earn on the un-recovered balance in the dam. I don't have the number for 2008 in front of me, but I believe it is up in the upper 20s. So, there is some growth in that as well. When you are fortunate enough to be in the territories like we are in the... with our regulated business in Carolina, where we continue to see great growth of 2% up to 3.5% to 4% in the different territories, it is very difficult to ever hit your allowed ROEs, because as soon as you put them into effect with the historical test here, that we have in all of our jurisdictions, with attrition you are already putting new steel in the ground or above the ground in wires et cetera and you are rarely going to hit those allowed returns", "The key to our business is to maintain the strong growth in our territories, including the economic development and to get timely, reasonable recovery from the regulators. And that's what we have been able to demonstrate, we think over the last several years. So, you might be right at it, but the only time you are really going to exceed it is if you have something abnormal in weather.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Thank you guys.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call over Mr. Jimmy Addison for final remarks.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, thank you. I want to thank everyone for your interest today and that we have a lot going on, there is a lot we hope to update you on soon with generation. In summary, we think we had a good 2007 coming off at disappointing 2006 and are poised for a very growth in 2008. We look forward to your continued interest.

My name is Lacy and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome every one to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions].

Any one who does not consent to the taping may drop the line -- may drop off the line at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Betty Best, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Betty Best - Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations", "Thanks Lacy and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call including those who are joining us on the webcast. Yesterday we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2008. In just a minute Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review those results and respond to questions.", "The earnings press release that we will refer to in this conference call is available on our website at scana.com. I would like to remind everyone that certain statements that may be made during today's call which are not statements of historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Including the risks and uncertainties discussed in the company's SEC fillings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Betty, and good morning. I would also like to welcome each of you to our call.", "SCANA reported first quarter earnings on a GAAP basis of $109 million or $0.94 per share compared to $86 million or $0.73 per share in the first quarter of 2007. The $0.21 per share increase in earnings was due to several factors, including sustained customer growth in both Carolinas, improved industrial and wholesale sales and the impact of the retail electric rate increase in South Carolina. We also had improved earnings in our non regulated retail, natural gas marketing business in Georgia. We are very pleased with these first quarter results, and although it is only one quarter it positions us well to archive our 2008 financial goals, as these three months represent nearly one-third of our annual forecast.", "As we look ahead to the rest of 2008, we are confident that the underlying strength of our service territories and the continued implementation of our growth through investments strategic plan will position us to meet shareholders expectations.", "Based on these first quarter results, we are reaffirming our 2008 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. This guidance assumes normal weather in our electric and natural gas service areas for the remainder of the year and excludes any potential impact from changes in accounting principles and certain gains or losses from investing activities, litigation and sales of assets. Other factors that may impact future earnings are discussed in our SEC fillings.", "We continue to target a long term average annual earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%. However as is obvious from our guidance we expect 2008 to yield earnings growth above this range. It's important to remember that this is an average annual target and accordingly in some years earnings may be above the range and some below.", "Our management team takes a long-term perspective on earnings growth, so our strategic planning process is focused on generating earnings growth that, on average, will fall within our targeted range.", "We were very pleased that our Board of Directors earlier this year approved a 4.5% increase in our common stock dividend to $1.84 per share, effective with the dividend that was paid on April 1st. SCANA has now raised the dividend on its common stock for nine consecutive years and in 54 of the last 56.", "Our policy is to increase the annual dividend at a rate that is aligned with the growth in the company's earnings while maintaining a pay out ratio of approximately 55% to 60%. And now I would like to provide an update on several other important items.", "As most of you already know, SCE&G and Santee Cooper, the state owned utility in South Carolina submitted a joint application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on March 31st for a combined construction and operating license or COL. If approved the COL would authorize the companies to build and operate up to two new nuclear units at our existing nuclear site.", "Since this filing, SCE&G has also announced that an agreement has been reached with a consortium of Westinghouse Electric and the Shaw Group authorizing the purchase of long lead-time materials related to the construction of the Westinghouse AP1000 design.", "While a final EPC contract has not yet been completed, it was important to initiate the purchase of these long lead-time materials to keep us on schedule for our 2016 service date.", "Specific financial details of these purchases were not disclosed, however, we will provide you with our comprehension financing strategy for the new nuclear plant as soon as the EPC contract is finalized, which we anticipate by the end of the second quarter.", "Our intention continues to be to gain authorization from the NRC and local regulators for two plants. We also plan to maintain our position on the schedule for long lead materials for two plants. However we will maintain flexibility as to the number of plants to build through contractual off ramps up until the actual final notice to proceed when construction is granted which we anticipate will be in 2011.", "On a related note, on April 1st, SCE&G officially advised the South Carolina PSC and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff that the company plans to file a combined application under the Base Load Review Act. The application will document the need for new generation as well as provide regulators with information they need to determine up front if the company's plan to construct the plant including the projected cost, schedule and signing decisions are prudent. While we have not set a specific date for filing the combined application, filing can be no sooner than May 1st or thirty days after the notification. From the application date the PFC would have 9 months to review and rule on the prudency of the decision to build.", "If the decision is found to be prudent, that finding will be binding on all future proceedings so long as the project is constructed in accordance with the schedules, estimates and projections set forth in the commission's order. For those of you who may not be familiar with the Base Load Review Act or BRLA, this law is intended to allow for the recovery of prudently incurred capital an operating costs associated with new nuclear generating facilities.", "After receiving a Base Load Review Order, the utility would be allowed to file revised rates with the commission for the annual recovery of financing cost related to CWIP.", "In-service expenses such as plant, O&M, depreciation and property taxes will be recovered through rates once the plant goes it to commercial operation. Requested rate adjustments will be based on the utilities updated cost of debt and capital structures.", "As for ROE, the utility can chose to file for a project specific return on equity or simply use the ROE from its most recent rates proceeding. SCE&G's current allowed ROE is 11%.", "While we anticipate our initial filing, we will have a minimal impact on revenues due to the limited expenditures to date. It will establish the critical decision of prudence and the plan for future annual rate adjustments. We will certainly keep you updated on the status of both the Base Load Review application and the EPC contract process as work continues.", "As to timing, I continue to anticipate that we would be able to fully communicate our plan by the end of second quarter. We are pleased that we have completed two significant financing in the first quarter of 2008 with the SCE&G first mortgage bond issue in January and the SCANA medium term notes in March. In aggregate these two financing reduced our short-term indebtedness by $500 million. While we will have additional financings issue related to the pollution control facilities we are installing on two fossil plants and for our new nuclear investments. It was important we accomplish these two transactions early in the year, to provide more flexibility as to when we execute the additional transactions.", "Additionally we are planning to fulfill our needs for shares, for our 401K and Investor Plus plans through new shares issues effective July 1. This will provide an estimated $45 million of additional equity during 2008 and about twice that amount annually for 2009 and forward.", "We anticipate keeping this strategy in place for the foreseeable future due to the anticipated construction. The minimally dilutive effect of these shares has been considered in our earnings guidance.", "Turning now to our recent regulatory filing in North Carolina, on March 31, PSNC Energy filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an increase in the company's retail and natural gas base rates of approximately $20 million or 2.99%. Since its last rate case filling in the 2006, PSNC has spent more then $188 million to upgrade and extend its gas delivery system.", "Company has installed more then 900 miles of transmission and distribution mains and added nearly 32,000 customers to its system. Also in the application, PSNC Energy is requesting to implement a customer usage tracker also called a CUT, which is a rate decoupling mechanism that breaks the link between revenues and the amount of natural gas sold. If approved the CUT would apply to residential and commercial customers and would allow the company to periodically adjust its base rates, based on changes in customer consumption.", "Hearings on the company's requests are expected to be held this fall, if approved the requested rates will go into effect in November of this year.", "And finally, I would like to remind everyone, we will be meeting in analysts in New York on May 15. The meeting will be held at approximately 8:15 AM at the Michelangelo Hotel. During that meeting members of our senior management team lead by CEO, Bill Timmerman will discuss our business strategies, review the company's recent operating and financial performance and respond to questions.", "An invitation to the meetings has been sent to each person on our financial community mailing list. If you have not already confirmed your attendance, please contact our Invertors Relations office. For those who are not able to attend, the company's presentation will be webcast both live and as a replay on our website.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll now be glad to respond to any question you might have.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Good morning.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "I wanted to ask you, what was the ROE at PSNC Energy for the last twelve months?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The return through December 31st, Paul, which is the test year we were using was down slightly below 9%.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And of course the last case from a couple of years ago, we actually had black box settlement, so there's not a specifically disclosed return, but it's generally in the range of our other regulated businesses.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "What did you file for on 31st?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We filed for a 12% requested return.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. The second question I have is, what was the weather impact for the quarter, was there one?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Compared to last year, it was flat and it was slightly below plan, about $0.03 per shares, $0.025 to $0.03 per share below normal as computed over 15 years.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay and then the wholesale electric sales?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "What's driving that?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well primarily, it is a reflection of last year being abnormally low, we had a couple of plants out for maintenance last year including one out for a fire that occurred in a plant, one of our major fossil plants and it was offline several weeks. So -- other plants ran very well this year in the first quarter and was something close to normal whether we were able to sell that energy off system.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "And the industrial sales. Sounds like good news there, kind of a -- just a little more flavor on what you are seeing there, is that export driven? What's going on there?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah Paul it's really an interesting pleasant surprise, we have looked at that a good deal over the last few days and its really spread across the board, the good news is it's not in any one major customer or plant expansion or things of that nature, we have had some of those but, for example, if you look at our top 20 industrial customers, two thirds of them used more energy this year then they did a year ago. And if you look at the customers below the top 20, their percentage increase is actually larger then the top twenty. So, it's kind of contradictory to everything we've been reading, but those are the facts of what's going on here in the quarter-over-quarter in South Carolina.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "And why do you think that is?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't really have a solid answer to that, but it's not isolated into any one area, which is really why we dug in to it. I thought I would find it was due to a unique expansion here or there, but it's more across the board and it's kind of contradictory to what we have been seeing. The unemployment rates are have ticked up slightly here in the state like they have nationally, but nothing outrageous.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Great. Okay, thanks a lot.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Good morning.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning Dan.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Kind of following up on the questions, the industrial gas sales were also a big percent. Was that due to a particular customer or what was going on there?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, nothing in particular that we noted Dan.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, just was it a bit colder than normal or?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, it was really -- and of course that would normally not affect industrials very much, with a minor amount of space heating, but nothing in particular and it was not a factor of weather.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And you talked about ROE and PSNC, what was of that South Carolina Electric?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In South Carolina, of course we have new rates that were affective January 1. So the return was for the year at 12/31, it's the latest date I have, it was down you know probably in the 8% or so range, but the new rates effective January 1 on a pro forma basis returned that up in the upper ten and three quarter range. On a pro formal basis assuming you had those revenues for the full year.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Right, right. You know you mentioned that the wholesale was lower than normal last year, so would you expect kind of the level you saw in the first quarter to you continue throughout the year then?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, of course, that's cyclical based upon the cyclical nature of the weather hear the south. I mean I think that's typical for a first quarter and of course the second quarter I would doubt it would be at that level just because it's a period of shoulder months here at the south, but it's also a period of a lot of the maintenance going on, so we will just have to wait and see.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Of your wholesale sales, are most of those interchanged sales or do you have like some contracts with co-ops or you know what's that the composition of those sales?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's a combination of the two, we have some longer-term contracts with municipalities, three or four municipalities here in this state that we sell to and then we sell also just opportunity sales, spot sales, as the weather and the different systems of the utility around dictate.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay and then, last thing I was wondering about is you know you talked a little bit about your nuclear construction plants. Are you ready yet, have you laid out yet kind of when you would hope to start construction or is it too early for that and what point would you -- your ready to start actually onsite work?", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Yeah Dan, it may be a little early for that but I tell you I have got Kevin Marsh here with me, the President SCE&G, who has been integrally involved with it and I think I'll let Kevin respond to your questions.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay.", "Kevin Marsh - President and Chief Operating Officer-South Carolina Electric and GasCo", "Hey Dan. As Jimmy mentioned, we filed the combined operating license with NRC and that process is going to take probably some were between 36 and 42 months to give them time to review that application. There's not a significant amount of major plant construction that can take place during that time, they might authorize some pre-construction expenditures, but the majority of what we will be doing will be of course any payments that are due on the long-lead time items, we'll make those payments, but we will be doing side prep work to make sure when we do get the license from the commission we are ready to start work. And that will involve clearing the land and any railroad spurs that need to be in to make sure we can move equipment in an out as necessary, all that will began to take place, but there will be no actual point of concrete or a hard dollar construction till we get that license from the commission.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Eric Beaumont with Copia Capital. Please proceed.", "Eric Beaumont - Copia Capital", "Good morning, congratulations on the quarter.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Eric Beaumont - Copia Capital", "Couple of quick questions, one; obviously the rate relief was important. Can you characterize how much of the additional margin in the first quarter was driven by the rate relief?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Eric at SCE&G, I think -- let me make sure, I think that number were about $0.16 in totals at the increase in SCE&G and about half of that was due to the rate increase and the balance, the other half was due to just customer growth on the system. Half of the other half or a quarter of the increase, if you will, was due to growth on the system and the other portion would be due to the wholesale, industrial sales up.", "Eric Beaumont - Copia Capital", "Okay. And if we think about how the rate relief is going to flow through the course of the year, is it more proportional to expected sales through the quarter or how it was it role in, it will?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it will be, very much trend our cyclical sales.", "Eric Beaumont - Copia Capital", "Okay, I guess next -- obviously the depreciation and amortization down, now you are not taking accelerated anymore for the backup at Murray Lake, what should we key in on where the depreciation and amortization was this quarter, is this kind of a benchmark going forward for the other quarters?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's a very good proxy for the balance of the year.", "Eric Beaumont - Copia Capital", "Okay, great and I think that's it, thank you guys.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Reeder with Wachovia. Please proceed.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Good morning gentlemen, can you talk a little bit on the Energy SCANA Energy, Georgia, what kind of drove the margins there, was it favorable hedging strategy on the gas side or what was it?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, Jon, I'll be glad too, really it was -- compared to the Carolinas, I mentioned earlier that weather was slightly below normal, the weather patterns in Georgia were just about normal. It's kind of odd between -- the difference between the states here that are obviously just next to each other, but that help us some, because last year's first quarter was a little below normal in Georgia, so we had volumes up as well as the market -- the pricing in the market just allowed for slightly wider margins during the 2008 year. Now that contribute a significant amount and of course when sales are up, we have commensurate level of reserves that we establish for bad debts that offset that slightly, but its about a 4:1 ratio of growth in margins compared to the additional reserves we established from the bad debt.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Okay so, it was largely just a return to normal weather kind of in Georgia that has accounted for that $0.03", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It was you know plus the ability to price somewhat better for the margins. A combination of volume and price.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. Did wholesale from the electric business, did that benefited all from the drought? Were you able to sell it all over to some of the surrounding states that were may be short to little power?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah I don't think that really impacted this first quarter we had thankfully a great deal of rain in the South East in the first quarter throughout Georgia and North Carolina which were both impact in much more severely than South Carolina. So I am not probably sure that impacted any. May have been more related to plant maintenance and other had down, things to that measure.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Okay and then lastly just a clarification issue, the synfuel royalties? Thing that you had identified in the corporate and other that was way to reversed, is that included in the $0.73 of was the ongoing number for Q1 '07 was at really $0.71?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The number was $0.73 for Q1 '07, and included $0.02 benefit from the royalties projected at that point and of course later in '07, as the price of oil rose we reversed those crude royalties that we had estimated in the first quarter. So the point, when you get at the end '08 that variances there quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter will not exist because we were first lighter in '07.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. So $0.73 was the actual end of the year including the -- or excluding the synfuel royalty, is that right?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "$0.73 was the first quarter's actual earnings including $0.02 of royalties.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Okay, I got it, thank you gentlemen.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please proceed.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "I have a question about the nuclear spend and the build out. How much of that is going to be accounted for as O&M especially in this early stage and how much of that will be capitalized through I'd say the next couple of years at least until you get that NRC approval?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It will all be capital up until the point we got the plan online.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Okay, does that include the application the cost?", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Okay, thank you.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And at this time we have no questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Jimmy Addision for closing remark.", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, I want to again thank every one for your attention and questions today on the call we appreciate your interest in our company. We've had a good start here to the first quarter and we are off to what we think will be a healthy 2008.

(NYSE:SCG) Q4 2008 Earnings Call February 12, 2009  9:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Betty Best - Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Kevin B. Marsh - President and Chief Operating Officer, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company", "Analysts", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Operator", "Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. My name is Lacy, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to SCANA Corporations Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, February 12, 2009. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Betty Best, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Betty Best", "Thanks Lacy, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast.", "Earlier today, we announced results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2008. In just a minute, Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review those results, give updates on certain operational issues, as well as our new nuclear program and respond to questions. The earnings press release that we will refer to in this conference call is available on our website at scana.com.", "I would like to remind everyone that certain statements that maybe made during today's call which are not statements of historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Among those risks and uncertainties are those discussed in the company's SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks Betty, and good morning. I would also like to welcome each of you to our call. This morning we reported 2008 full year earnings of $2.95 per share compared to $2.74 per share in 2007. The growth in 2008 earnings per share represents a 7.7% increase over 2007 and met our guidance.", "For the fourth quarter of 2008 we reported earnings of $0.73 per share, down slightly from $0.75 per share in the same quarter of 2007. Table summarizing earnings variances and sales metrics for the quarter and full year are provided in the earnings press release.", "The $0.21 per share increase in earnings for the year was driven primarily by the retail electric rate increase and the favorable impact of continued customer growth in both Carolinas, which offset increased expenses for operations and maintenance, interest and property taxes. The $0.02 per share erosion in the fourth quarter was primarily a result of the impact of slightly higher OEM expense and reduced electric usage, which more than offset improved electric margins driven by the retail electric rate increase and the favorable impact of continued customer growth.", "We are very pleased to have delivered strong financial results and great value for our shareholders despite the economic challenges and temperate weather we experienced, especially during the fourth quarter.", "Concerning customer growth, we're seeing a reduction in growth, but still growth in most of our business. In our electric service area SCE&G's annual customer growth declined from 2.6% or about 16,000 customers in 2007 to 1.6% or about 10,000 customers in 2008.", "In our regulated gas businesses, SCE&G's customer growth declined from 1.8% or 5,300 customers in 2007 to 1.5% or 4,600 customers in 2008. While PSNC's customer growth declined from 3.6% or about 16,000 customers in 2007 to 2.3% or about 11,000 customers in 2008.", "Looking at our non-regulated gas businesses, SCANA Energy, a Georgia natural gas marketer experienced a 5% customer decline or about 25,000 customers in 2008 due to more intense competition. However, we've implemented an aggressive marketing campaign over the last several months and have attracted the majority of market switches during that period.", "Our customer growth remained a positive contributor to earnings of $0.09 per share, weather normalized usage for our residential electric customers was down between 1 and 2% from 2007, for an estimated earnings impact of about $0.05 per share. We are closely monitoring inactive accounts and are pleased that we have seen the material increase in those numbers as some others have reported.", "For our long-term wholesale and our off-system customers, energy sales were down $0.03 per share for 2008 due to the overall market demand for electricity. Also, the demand for electricity has decreased so has the price of natural gas. Natural Gas is now at a price that combines cycle generation is competitive with most company's base load coal units.", "We estimate that weather negatively impacted earnings $0.06 per share in 2008 compared to normal. In 2007, we estimate weather was $0.09 below normal, so the year-over-year impact was $0.03 per share improvement.", "Turning now to the economy. Like most other regions, the southeast has not been immune to the current recession. Businesses scrambling to cut calls are taking a painful toll on our original labor market. December preliminary unemployment numbers for our service territories range from 8.1% in Georgia to 9.5% in South Carolina.", "Early in 2008, we began efforts to adapt and respond to what originally was expected to be an economic slowdown. As the year unfolded we took progressively more stringent steps as the financial markets and the residential construction sector both collapsed and the unemployment in the manufacturing sector began to decline. These actions have enabled us to offset some of the negative impacts from the slower economy in milder weather.", "We recognized that we must continued to use our resources wisely while meeting our customers' energy requirement safely, reliably and at the lowest cost possible over the long term.", "As you may be aware, yesterday the South Carolina PSC approved our nuclear application. I've asked Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G, to join me on the call today and will turn it over to him in a few minutes for more details on this matter as well as our update on where we stand with the NRC at the federal level. But before I leave nuclear, I would like to give you an update on our DOE loan guarantee applications.", "On September 26th, SCE&G filed a Part I application for the loan guarantee under the Energy Policy Act 2005 to support the construction of the two new nuclear units. On October the 2nd, the DOE announced it had received 19 Part I applications from 17 electric power companies. After reviewing the Part I submissions, the DOE assigned initial rankings of the projects based on the factors summarized in each solicitation. We received notification in late November that SCE&G has been initially ranked second.", "The DOE identified several factors that had a significant impact on our assessment. First, SCE&G's strong financial commitment in history of three decades of joint operations with our proposed partners Santee Cooper, back in our clear commitment to the project and to nuclear power as a low cost alternative.", "Third, state and regulatory authorities are supportive of nuclear power and a few willing to provide CWIP in rate base. Fourth, demand in our region is strong and growing; and fifth, we have assigned EPC contract. We filed the Part II submission of the application on December 19th. The next step is an oral presentation which is scheduled for later this month.", "Moving now to sources of capital. The challenging conditions during 2008 tested utilities, liquidity and their ability to access short-term funding sources. We are pleased that all of the banks and our revolving credit facility is fully funded our request withdrawals. As of December 31st, we have drawn approximately $450 million from our $1.1 billion facility. We have approximately $80 million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding and approximately $250 million in cash and temporary investments.", "We regularly monitored the commercial paper and short-term credit markets to optimize the timing repayment of the outstanding balance on withdrawals while maintaining the appropriate levels of liquidity for the company.", "At December 31st, we had net availability liquidity of approximately $800 million and our revolving credit facilities are in place until December 2011. We also successfully issued $300 million of first mortgage bonds in September at a rate of 6.5% during a difficult period of time. Our overall debt portfolio has weighted average maturity of over 13 years and there is an average of 5.62%.", "All of our long-term debt other than our facility withdrawals bears fixed interest rates. We continued to believe that it's most prudent for our costumers to finance our long-term assets with long-term fixed rate instruments.", "To further preserve our liquidity we have vigorously reviewed our CapEx and operating costs for 2009, and have adjusted where we can without impacting safety, reliability and core costumer service. I'll speak a bit more about CapEx and 2009 expectations in a few minutes.", "Another source of cash I mentioned during our last quarterly call relates to the conversion of our stock plans to original issue. Since July 1 of 2008, shares of the company stock purchased on behalf of participants in our investor plus and 401(k) plans are being acquired through original issue shares rather than on the open market. This provided over $40 million of additional cash equity during 2008, and is expected to provide about twice that amount annually for 2009 and forward, due primarily to new nuclear construction plans we anticipate keeping this strategy in place for the foreseeable future.", "The minimally dilutive effect of these shares was considered in preparing our 2009 earnings guidance and our future nuclear revised rate filings will provide for the periodic update of our capital structure to help mitigate future dilution and to incorporate additional debt issuances.", "In late December, it was announced that SCANA was selected to replace Merrill Lynch in the S&P 500 Index effective December 31st. Inclusion in this Index is attributed to the hard work of our employees and speaks to the strength of our strategic business model and the execution of the long-term fundamentals that we build on company all. In quick response to this action by S&P, the company issued 2.875 million shares, raising over $100 million with no noticeable pressure on our stocks' market value.", "In fact, our stock increased approximately 5% from the period of eagerly prior to the S&P announcement to the pricing of the deal.", "We previously indicated our intend to finance capital expenditures for our new nuclear units to a roughly equal combination of debt and equity financing and we had expected to conduct an equity offering during the second quarter of 2009. However, due to the minimal period of additional months outstanding and the more efficient execution in this type transaction, company decided to sell its common stock sooner than previously contemplated.", "With the reduction of Cap Expense plan for 2009 and planned operating cost reductions, this transaction makes it unlikely that we will need to raise additional equity in 2009 beyond that issue through our investor plus and 401(k) plans.", "As we look forward to 2009, our focus continues to be very cautious and conservative in both operations and finance, while maintaining our standards for customer service, reliability and safety.", "In preparing our guidance for 2009, we considered the operating results of the latter months of 2008, projected production of our largest industrial customers, known changes in property taxes, governmental fees, healthcare costs, pension costs and other major expense categories.", "We are issuing preliminary guidance for 2009 earnings of $2.65 to $2.95 per common share. This guidance assumes normal weather in our electric and natural gas service areas for the balance of 2009, with the minimal call growth in the regulated jurisdictions and an effective tax rate of approximately 35%.", "Core to our assumptions, our electric customer growth and usage at the residential and commercial level and loss of industrial base. Specifically we have assumed our overall electric margin for 2009 is about $10 million or $0.05 per share less than 2008. Components of this decrease are: first, we assume no residential and commercial growth even though we continued to add customers over the last few months. Second, we've assumed all industrial reductions announced to-date are in place for the entire year.", "Third, we've assumed that our wholesale contract for approximately 190 megawatts of capacity expires on April 30th. Our guidance 2009 assumes revenue stream for the last eight months of the year, and assumes we do not resale the capacity otherwise. We estimate the impact to be about $0.06 per share. Any placement of this capacity and related energy elsewhere would mitigate the impact. And fourth, we assumed only growth in margins comes from the base load review back increases in late March and the first revise rate adjustment, November 1st of approximately 2.8%. In aggregate we estimate these two increases will contribute $0.07 per share to 2009 earnings.", "Other key drivers for 2009 include no further erosion in the industrial sector, no electric base rate increases during 2009, continued company wide efforts to control O&M costs, and sustained profitability of non-regulated business. Of course, we will continue to monitor the economy and other developments. As we move through 2009 getting additional clarity on drivers like customer growth, usage, market conditions et cetera, we expect to narrow this band.", "Moving now to some other items, SCANA Energy's current term serving as Georgia's sole regulated provider of natural gas ends August 31st this year. This is a role that company has had since the regulated provider program began in 2002. SCANA Energy was one of only two marketers pre-qualified by the Georgia Public Service Commission to file a bid for this business. Bid packages were due January 20 and we expect a decision by the Commission in early March.", "While this piece of the Georgia business isn't material to our annual operating results, we believe it is important that someone appropriately serve these customers in order for the broader market to have stability. We believe SCANA is best positioned to provide this stability.", "SCANA has experienced significant declines in our defined benefit pension assets due to the significant declines in the broad market. However, as we had approximately $1.32 in assets for every dollar of liability at the beginning of the year, we remained in better shape in most.", "As of December 31st, we had a simple funded ratio of 89% in an asset smooth ratio which is used for funding purposes of 107%, meaning we will not have to make cash contribution during 2009.", "The decline in pension assets will however impact our non-cash pension expense. As a significant partial mitigation of this impact, we recently received an important ruling from the South Carolina PSC, allowing us to defer incremental pension expense above that included in current rates for both of our South Carolina regulated businesses. These calls will deferred until our next base rate filing, at which time the accumulated deferred cost will be addressed prospectively.", "Considering this important regulatory order, we estimate our 2009 pension expense across all of our businesses will increase our pre-tax cost by approximately $12 million or $0.06 per share.", "For 2009, we continued to take all possible steps to manage expenses while still providing the safe and reliable service our customers expect. Actions taken in 2009 include salary freezes for exempt employees, hiring freezes across most departments and holding non-labor O&M spending for 2009 to amounts which are at or below 2008 levels.", "Regarding capital projects. Currently, we have scrubbers under construction at our Wateree and Williams plants. We are pleased to report that both are currently ahead of schedule and on budget. Additionally, the selected catalytic reduction project was recently completed in our coke generating station on schedule and on budget. These three projects in total comprise nearly the entire $400 million environmental CapEx budget through 2010 that we shared with you back in May.", "In October, we received an important order from the PSC, allowing us to defer oil costs including depreciation and property taxes on these projects until the projects are closed into rates as part of our next base rate proceedings.", "Turning now to our capital expenditures. We are carefully reviewing our CapEx projects for the coming three years to determine those that can be deferred until we see signs of economic recovery in our territory. We looked very hard at capital projects related to low growth, especially in transmission and distribution and we reduced capital... planned capital expenditures where we could do so without compromising the guidelines established with service level, safety and reliability.", "While we cannot predict full impact of the current economic and financial crisis, we continued to see costumer growth in our regulated electric and gas service territories and must respond to this growth. Our forecast continued to show that we will need the additional generations, our new nuclear units will provide in order to support load growth in our system.", "In fact, a review of the recessions of the last several decades consistently shows declining electrical consumption during the recession, followed by post-recession robust growth. We have to be prepared for this long-term growth to provide the energy needed for both our residential costumers and the commercial and industrial segments which will support the underlying jobs creation.", "We see our generation expansion program as a long-term investment and the future of our costumers and our state, so that dependable, non-emitting energy is available for a growing service territory. We are pleased that the South Carolina Public Service Commission and Office of Regulatory Staff had concurred.", "While we have made some preliminary reductions in our forecasts, we have not completed the review. Our detailed CapEx forecast will be provided in our 10-K filling later this month, and is subject to further revisions until we can quantify the full impact of the DLI (ph) decision yesterday.", "Finally, I would like to take a few moments to discuss our financing plans for 2009. In terms of debt maturities and financing needs, SCE&G has one first mortgage bond of $100 million maturing in March that we expect to refinance in the second quarter. We expect to upsize this issue somewhat, to pay down short-term debt. We also expect one another mortgage bond financing in the third quarter.", "Our total anticipated debt financing for SCE&G in 2009 are not expected to exceed $450 million, all in the form of first mortgage bonds. As I said earlier, we do not expect to issue additional equity during 2009 other than through the stock plans.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin for a thorough update on our nuclear project.", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Thanks Jimmy, and good morning. Yesterday, the South Carolina Public Service Commission ruled on our base load review application for the construction of two new Westinghouse AP1000 Nuclear Plants.", "There are two major components to the decision: first, the commission had to approve the citing of the new plants under the utility facility citing an Environmental Protection Act. Under this Act, Commission must first approve the need for the facility. Second, determine the proposed units serve the interest of system economy and reliability. And third, make an evaluation of the environmental impacts.", "In this decision, the Commission approved the citing of the new units, and noted that the evidence presented in the case shows that the size, type, location, and technology of the units are the preferable means of doing so, with the greatest economy and reliability, and with the least impact on the environment.", "Next, the commission needed to make a decision under the Base Load Review Act. Under provisions of the Act, the Commission was required to conduct a full preconstruction prudency review of the proposed units and the EPC contract, under which they will be built. Although, we do not have the file order with all of the details, we understand that basic provisions are revert to be. One, approval of the two plants as requested with South Carolina Electric & Gas owning 55% of the units.", "Two, approval of the initial rate increase of 7.8 million, or 0.4% related to recovery of the cost of capital on our project expenditures through June 30, 2008. Third, approval of an 18 month construction schedule contingency applicable to the project milestones schedule, or components of the milestone schedule as presented by the company and the hearings. And four, a directive to complete the current study of potential demand side management programs, as testified to by the company and to present the commission with a viable proposal to achieve measurable and sustainable gains in energy efficiency for all of the company's customer classes. This proposal is to be filed with the Commission by June 30, 2009 which is consistent with the mid-summer date offered by the company in the hearings.", "You can access the full text of the commission's directive in this case on the SCANA website, on the Webcast & Presentations page.", "We are pleased with the Commission's decision in this case, and believe they are approval of our request to build the new nuclear plants is a key milestone and our efforts to meet South Carolina's growing needs proclaim reliable energy.", "We expect to hold a separate, more detailed webcast on this matter after we received the written order from the commission which is due by February 28th.", "And now let me give you a quick update on a related filing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.", "On March 31, 2008, we submitted our combined construction and operating license or COL application to the NRC. This COL application for the two new units was reviewed for completeness by the NRC and docketed on July 31, 2008.", "On September 26th, the NRC issued a 30 month review schedule from the docketing date to the issuance of the Safety Evaluation Report, which will signify a satisfactory completion of their review.", "Both the environmental and safety reviews by the NRC continued to be in progress, and should support a COL issuance by July 1, 2011. This date would support both the project schedule and the unit two and unit three substantial completion dates for the two new units in 2016 and 2019 respectively.", "I'll now turn the call back over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks Kevin. In closing, 2008 was a very successful year for our company in many respects. From an operational perspective, we continued to experience customer growth in our electric and natural gas utility business. Our generating plants performed safely, reliably and efficiently.", "In our natural gas operations SCANA Energy maintained its position as a second largest marketer in Georgia. We continued to receive reasonable and timely support in each of our regulated utility jurisdictions.", "In North Carolina, the Commission issued an order approving an increase in PSNC's retail and natural gas base rates in addition to allowing PSNC to implement a rate decoupling mechanism for usage tracker that severs the link between revenues and the amount of natural gas sold. This tracker allows the company to periodically adjust its base rates when changes in costumer consumption occur.", "In South Carolina, the PSC approved an increase in SCE&G's retail gas base rates under the Rate Stabilization Act. Due to the impact of substantially lower gas costs, even after the increases in base rates, retail gas rates today are approximately 12% lower of PSNC and 25% lower at SCE&G than they were this time last year.", "We created additional value for our shareholders by growing EPS by nearly 7.7% and increasing the cash dividend on our common stock about 4.5%. Finally, we made tremendous progress with our nuclear projects.", "As Kevin has discussed, we now have the state processes in place to proceed with the facilities needed by our costumers, resulting in strategic shareholder value for years to come.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. And we'll now be glad to respond to any questions or comments you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from the line of Steve Fleishman with Catapult Capital. Please proceed.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Yeah, hi guys. This is Steve Fleishman. How are you?", "Jimmy Addison", "Great. How about you?", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "I'm good. Couple of questions; first, the $10 million electric margin reduction that you talked about 2009 versus 2008.", "Jimmy Addison", "Right.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Does that exclude the weather impact for '08 as the base, is that like a weather normalized for both years or is the weather in there as well?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, what we're assuming is we're working off of '08's actual and of course we're projecting '09 as normal weather. So it's working off of '08.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay. So actually weather normalized reduction is bigger than that because '08 had below normal weather?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's correct.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay. So there should be like a weather benefit that's within that 10 million, so then the non-weather part should be larger?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's correct.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay. And I think, you said weather was about $0.06 below normal in '08, is that correct? Okay. And then on the issue of the pension?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "You said that the pension costs are going to be up about 12 million?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's right, pre-tax.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Pre-tax, and that includes the fact that some of the pension you're getting to defer. So it would have been up more than that?", "Jimmy Addison", "It would have.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "If not for the deferral order that you received?", "Jimmy Addison", "Correct.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay. And then, just overall when you look at the pressure on '09 versus '08, is pretty much all of it at SCE&G or is there some pressure at Georgia and some of these other businesses as a really all to utility?", "Jimmy Addison", "Steve, I think the economy is fairly similarly and all three of our major jurisdictions here. The, for example, the unemployment rates we discussed range from 8.1% in Georgia to 9.5% in South Carolina.", "On the other hand Georgia's housing market rose substantially more than South Carolina's did and has therefore fallen more. So there are different factors impacting it. But, I think the issue of customer usage and the issue of slowing growth of applies to all three territories.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "And we've had relatively leasing of a minor, but recent increases in the LDC gas businesses in November, both in North Carolina and South Carolina. So those are... you are going to get a full 12 months of that in 2009. Whereas, as I said, we don't anticipate increasing rates in the electric business during 2009. So you've got the timing of that impacting it.", "And of course in Georgia, we lost by about 25,000 customers year-over-year from 12 months ago. But we've really gained several in the last three months. We did on a good trend there.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay. So that shouldn't be a big factor then?", "Jimmy Addison", "It should not. And even in January, we just looked at some numbers a couple of days ago. And one of our core assumptions in this March, and that you are asking about it, that we add not one new residential customer beyond this December 1st... or December 31st. And we're still adding those customers. In January for example, we added 4 to 500 electric customers, about 600 gas customers in South Carolina, and about 1,900 gas customers in North Carolina. So we're still seeing the growth and that's important. We're just... we're naturally in accordance with our culture, conservative about this and giving a broader range because of that.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay. One another question on the growth rate.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "The 4 to 6% growth rate.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "What is the base here for that 4 to 6% growth rate?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, it's an ongoing long-term period. If you look at any one point in time, if you look over three to five year period, you ought to see the growth rate in that range of 4 to 6% and we're still confident that giving the long-term.", "Now, we're here in the short-term period where the economy is down, where we're not going to go in and have rates increased in 2009 on top of this economy and our electric business. But in the longer run we're still comfortable with that growth rate.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay. And then, do you still plan to be growing the dividend at the same rate that you've been growing it?", "Jimmy Addison", "Our Board will take up that discussion next week. And we'll be back to you, end of next week with a decision on that matter.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay. Is then when you normally raise the dividend?", "Jimmy Addison", "It is.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "In February, okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "It is... we just... our Board meeting is actually the week after this earnings call this year. So normally, we're giving you all that information on this call. We release that piece separately for you.", "Steve Fleishman - Catapult Capital", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're welcome. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Rodman with Dukane (ph). Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "My question, on the Georgia and the retail business there, could you just talk a little bit more about the competitive pressures you're seeing and margin impacts that maybe incurring? Are you seeing lower margins on the new customers that you are signing up, or just give us little more color on what's going on in that market?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. I think when you get a material market. Many times market materials and folks get their processes down path, it tends to bring down the margins. But the larger driver I would say in addition to maturity of the market is that more customers are moving into fixed-rate plans. In those fixed-rate plans bear risk... less risks for the providers, for the marketers. I'm speaking generally now and not just about SCANA. And so, I think you're seeing lowers margins in that fixed-rate business.", "A couple of years ago maybe 15% of our business was in fixed-rate, 85% variable. And today it's about 70-30 variable and fixed. And that's a reaction by customers to high gas prices post Katrina and Rita. And when the prices came back down, more folks are moving into the fixed rates, and are taking those risks off the table, and bearing the risk that price could go down further, and they'd be locked in at higher rates. But that's a part of the squeeze as well.", "And then frankly, SCANA has been aggressive the last few months in pricing our product. And if you look at the large marketers, the top four, if you look at the total bill, we are either at the bottom or next to the bottom in the pricing of that in the last few months in an acquisition strategy.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Is this going from a predominantly variable to little more fixed-cost product change materially in anyway, the way you think about kind of collateral needs to provide that product? And are there any kind of credit issues we should think about in terms of maybe you're seeing more lines drawn or in the interim period, while you services those contracts going up into the heating seasons?", "Jimmy Addison", "Not really. I mean the folks are going to use, the gas are going to use no matter which plant they are under. Of course, when they do unlike the fixed option, we batch all of those and go out and put financial contracts behind those, so that we are hedged and there could be margin call on those if the prices change, but it's just not significant.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our next question will come from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin. Please proceed.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Good morning.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good morning, Dan.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "One of you could give us a little more color on the decline in the fourth quarter and industrial and wholesale electric sales? Do you had any actual closures of large customers or is that mostly cutbacks unless there are certain areas that are more impacted than others?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. Dan, as you noticed they are on the statistics in the back of the press release, our sales for the quarter to industrials were down about 9.5%. There is no one segment. We've analyzed that thoroughly. There have been a couple of operations that have closed until further notice, most of the impact though has been pairing back and there is no industry segment that is isolated too. We've looked at that thoroughly and it's just kind of across the board due to the demand.", "I might just remind you that we have... we don't really have any single large segment that dominates our industrial market. The largest is probably the commercials, the chemical segment, which is about a third. But there are like eight or nine classes, SIC classes that make up our industrial segment. And most of them are 5 to 6% of the total industrials overall.", "The other thing I would tell you that's important about this is the composition of our margins. And if you take the margins of SCE&G's electric business, about half of those margins now not sales but margins come from the residential sector. Another third come from the commercial sector, and only 12% of our margins come from the industrial sector and the remaining 5% comes from wholesale and another classes.", "Though while the industrials are down, the margins are much thinner in that business because of the lower cost to serve and the way the rate structure is established. So you just don't see a pro-rata impact on the bottom line from a similar reduction in industrial that you would in residential.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Okay. How about the wholesale, it dropped by 42%?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, that's... everyone else is experiencing what we have in our own maybe of territory, which is there are just not been a lot of demand outside of the area. And, of course, it was a mild quarter as well, although our severance quarter was mild also, but December was very mild here. But there just wasn't a demand for that off system. And frankly, where some of the demands being created in the northeast in the past and we've sold into other markets, it was not there in the other markets for us to sell wholesale either.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Okay. On the margins in electrical, it was up $0.41 for the year. I was wondering how much of that is attributable to the rate increase and how much to other factors, do you know how that splits up?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, the vast majority is the rate increase. I think, 38 or $0.39 of it is was the rate increase.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Okay. And that one in effect in January right... so that, should be not an effect for '09 right?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's right. You've got a full year's work there.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Right, okay. And I was wondering have you, what's your CapEx budget for '09 and have you adjusted that any based on the economic situation?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well as I've said earlier, we have made some adjustments already, but those are ongoing and we are not going to release our detailed CapEx to you until we file the 10-K here in another few weeks. But we have made some reductions. And I think the important point at this time is that we're comfortable that we'll not have to go out and do another equity deal at this point. We can do with the equity deal we have under our belt earlier as part of the index deal and with the debt we have planned we should be in good shape from a CapEx lending perspective.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Okay. And kind of related to that, I know you have $100 million maturity on March 1. Do you have any plans to issue new debt in next quarter?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. As I said earlier, what we're going to do is we're going to probably upsize that deal, and pay down some of the short-term debt. But that's really a kind of a dynamic issue. We're going to model the credit markets, we're going to model the commercial paper markets, watch those. At this point we're still sitting on $250 million of cash whereas this time of a year ago we probably had a less than 50. But we're still going to be conservative with that.", "And we're going to need to decide how much cash are we willing to live with, how stable are the markets, and we'll determine at that point how much to do the deal for. But overall we expect to do in the balance of the year somewhere less than or at a maximum $450 million of debt.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Reeder with Wachovia. Please proceed.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Good morning, gentlemen. I'm still trying to get I guess a better grasp on 2009 expectations. So, can you remind me, I might have missed it in your remarks, but is the next electric filing expected still in 2009, but new rates not until '10?", "Jimmy Addison", "Jonathan, as I've said in the past, we generally expect to be on a two to three year cycle. We will have had the existing rates in place for two years at the end of this year of 2009. But in this economy, we are not prepared yet to answer your question. Basically, we are not prepared yet to say when we will be in for new rates.", "We do... our assumption though for the '09 guidance is that we do not expect new rates to impact '09 revenue. And we're going to monitor the situation, try to best understand the economy as we can and determine then where we might request new base rates at SCE&G.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. And then as far as the retail margin on the electric side, what's the assumption I guess for non-weather related electric usage? I know you said you're assuming flat customer growth, what about just on the usage side, absent the weather tick-up?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, our assumption is, as I said we experienced in the tail end of the 2008 about 1 to 2% reduction in usage if you neutralize weather. And what we have done is taken that same assumption or that same result and modeled it for the entire year of '09. So, we're assuming that the consumption stays down for the whole year of 2009 as it did the last few months of 2008.", "I'll tell you I gave you a range in my prepared comments of 1 to 2%, because that it really is a... there really is some art to that. It's not completely science. When you attempt to remove the impact of weather that is not an exact science. And so, we're trying to estimate consumption reduction, and we're using that to model it throughout the entire year 2009.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. And then, what about just in general, your expectations I guess, for an economic recovery? Are you kind of modeling a stabilization in the second half and no pick up whatsoever in say Q4 or I guess, what are you kind of seeing on the general landscape there?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, we don't, of course, have access to anything that you don't. I read what you read. But our assumptions are we're going to stay conservative to this. And we're going to assume that we don't add another residential customer or commercial customer beyond January 1. And we know we're adding some.", "So, we're going to... my point is that we're really trying to be conservative about these assumptions. And to give you much more detail than we have in the past about what our assumptions are, so that you can build your own models and make your assumptions of what they might be. That's why we moved to a $0.30 band on our guidance.", "And again our commitment is as we move through the year assuming these things become clear I sure hope that we'll... that we can come back and narrow that band, and firm up some of these assumptions for you.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "About earnings guidance, we tend to be, as we do in most things, fairly conservative. And we've been providing guidance since 2000. This will be the 10th year we provided guidance. And every year that we provided guidance with the exception of one, we've met our original guidance.", "That one year was '06. We came along later in the year and revised it because of the loss of two very large industrial customers. One related to a train accident, and a chemicals spill that shut down a plant, and very temperate weather. And then, we've met that revised guidance.", "But, we're really trying to layout for all of you folks the detailed assumptions, and what we've assumed going into there. So we hope to be able to revise it during the year.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Yeah. I mean, I would definitely agree. I mean, it seems like you've taken very conservative approach to '09. So, I'm wondering like if all these, I guess, almost worst case, I mean I don't want to call a worst case scenario, but if all these forecasts hold true, I mean does that put us then I mean in the middle of the range or would that put us towards the lower end of your range?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's a great question. But, I think I'll wait till later in the year to announce that.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Alright, got you. And then, I guess one last thing, and I'm not sure how much more you will be help me out. But going back to Steve's question on the 4 to 6% annual EPS growth target, I mean looking at 2009, if we end up in the middle of the range '10, would we expect the 4 to 6% off of that base or do you expect that I guess kind of catch up from the last year and say 2010 or 2011?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, and that's really going to be driven by your earlier question about the base rate increase in the electric business and that's going to have to be affected before we get back, recover that catch-up.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. But ultimately, I guess it sounds like once the economy gets I guess backup and running, and you get I guess the rate release, you expect to kind of makeup for this somewhat last year in 2009?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, and the reason is that it's really driven by underlying customer growth and rate base growth. And yesterday we got a very strategic decision from the Public Service Commission about the Base Load Review Act. We now have that in our hands to move forward with that.", "We know what the drivers of that will be, that's where a significant piece of our rate base growth is coming. The fact is the core of your question is that we're under earnings allowed return right now in the electric business and until that is re-established through the economy recovering and through periodic base increase and base rates every two to three years, we'll not be back into that band.", "But the long-term core growth has not changed. I mean it's slowed, but the customers still move here, the rate base is expanding, we've got $400 million of environmental projects that are not in rates today, that will need to be moved in rates at some point of course they are earnings AFC during the interim. But nothing has changed in our underlying core strategy and for a long-term stability of the southeast.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wachovia Securities", "Okay, got you. Thanks so much for the time.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're very welcome.", "Operator", "This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you very much. We appreciate all of your interests, continuing interests in our company here. And we expect to be back to you in the near term once we get an order out of the Public Service Commission with more details on the nuclear project and we'll keep you updated quarterly.

Thank you for standing by. My name is Michelle, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call.", "All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator instructions) As a reminder this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 23rd. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Betty Best, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Betty Best", "Thanks, Michelle, and good afternoon. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. Earlier today, we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2009. In just a minute, Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review those results and respond to questions.", "The earnings press release that we will refer to in this conference call is available on our Web site at scana.com. I would like to remind everyone that certain statements that may be made during today's call which are not statements of historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed in the company's SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Betty, and good afternoon. I\u2019d also like to welcome each of you to our call. SCANA reported first quarter earnings on a GAAP basis of $114 million or $0.94 per share compared to $109 million or $0.94 per share in the first quarter of 2008. This break even results were due primarily to lower operating and maintenance expenses and favorable weather in our electric service territory, which effectively offset the negative impact of lower natural gas margins, lower industrial and all system sales and share dilution.", "Given the current economic conditions and the impact of dilution, we\u2019re very pleased with these first quarter results. As we looked to the remainder of 2009, we remained cautiously optimistic that the underlying strength of our service territories and our continued company wide cost control efforts will allow us to deliver solid financial results while still producing the level of service our customers have come to expect.", "Now, I\u2019d like to review the first quarter results for our principle lines of business. As a reminder, the majority of SCANA operations are regulated.

These break even results are attributable to lower O&M expenses and favorable weather in our electric service territory, which also set the negative impact of lower natural gas margins and share dilution.", "As of March 31 of this year, SCE&G was serving approximately 652,000 electric customers, which represents a 1.4% increase during the past year. Over that same period, SCE&G\u2019s natural gas customer base increased 1.3% to approximately 309,000.", "Yesterday, the South Carolina Public Service Commission approved an adjustment in the fuel component of SCE&G\u2019s electric base rates that will allow fuel recovery of higher fuel costs that were incurred for fuel to operate the company\u2019s electric generating plants over the past twelve months.", "In recognition of the impact that rising energy cost are having on our customers, we agreed to spread the recovery of those costs over a three year period. And in consideration of the extended period, we\u2019re allowed to collect interest on the deferred balance.

And it initially awarded the contract to another supplier. However, prior to commencement of service with the new supplier, Orangeburg decided to seek continued service from SCE&G under this mutually beneficial extension.", "PSNC Energy, our retail natural gas distribution company in North Carolina, reported earnings for the first quarter of $30 million or $0.25 per share compared to $28 million or $0.24 per share in the same quarter in 2008. That improvement was due mainly to new rates effective in November of last year, more than offsetting the share dilution.

Additionally, we\u2019re continuing to fulfill our equity needs by issuing new shares through our 401-K in dividend reinvestment plans.

Please proceed.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Quick question, O&M down a ton year-over-year, first quarter to first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about that? Which segment did you \u2013 where did that occur? Meaning which of your businesses? How recurring is that difference when I think about the rest of 2009 or even first quarter of 2010?", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure, Michael. First of all, it really occurred across all of our businesses. It was a conscious effort. You\u2019ve heard us talk about this for the last two or three quarters as it was obvious we were heading into a recessionary period. And our strategy has been to control those O&M costs that we can and restrain those that would not have an impact on safety, reliability, or customer service. And that's what we've done.", "So it's really occurred across all of our businesses. There have been general reductions. For example, one of the more tangible ones is we only provided salary increases this year for predominantly our hourly employees. So the salary employees, the management, et cetera have not had wage increases over the last 14 plus months now.", "With the slow down of the economy, we have in the past, with the robust growth we've had, we\u2019ve had to rely on external contractors to do a lot of the expansion work. And with the slow down, we've been able to remove some of those contractors from the system, use our existing personnel to do more of the construction work. So some of that cost is now being capitalized from our existing personnel where in the past it was more O&M expense.", "Maybe a little surprising, bad debt expense is down. We're really encouraged by where we are to this point. We're still cautiously optimistic for quarter-over-quarter, that's over $4 million from a quarter-over-quarter year apart. And we attribute a lot of that to our enhanced process season in the Georgia market; enhanced security there.", "We also attribute it to \u2013 a lot of it to lower commodity cost, especially on the GAAP side. The bills were substantially less than they were a year ago with the falling cost.", "And then finally, with our \u2013 as you\u2019ve seen our guidance for 2009, we obviously are in a year where we're not expecting growth year-over-year. And so our incentive targets for our incentive compensation throughout our employee base, including the management team, the board has set those at staggered targets that start at the middle of our earnings guidance and go up to the top of our earnings guidance. And so, we're clearly not expecting at the middle of the guidance to hit some of those. So we\u2019ve got lower incentive CompCost recorded to date.", "So that's a long answer to your question. But some of those we expect to be recurring, at least as long as the economy is in this kind of condition. And as the economy returns, we would expect some of these costs to come back. For example, the example I gave you about using our personnel to do construction cost. As we get to a more robust growth rate, we will have to bring back some contractors. And therefore our cost will go back up with those. But some of it will be more directly correlated to the economy.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. Thank you, Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Catapult. Please proceed.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "Hi, guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hi, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "Can you hear me okay?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "Okay. Sorry. First, just a question on the weather impact because last year I think, you had below normal weather?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's correct.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "So can you give us some sense? When you talk about favorable weather, is that primarily a benefit versus last year or was actually favorable versus normal?", "Jimmy Addison", "It's a little of both, Steve. It's $0.08 year-over-year, and about $0.05 of that is getting back to normal. So if you took \u201808\u2019s quarter, you have to add $0.05 to get back to normal. And so we were about $0.03 above normal for the quarter.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "Got you. Okay. When you gave guidance for 2009, you talked a lot about conservative assumptions that you incorporated.", "Jimmy Addison", "Right.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "A couple things, one of them was this contract, the Orangeburg contract going away which you\u2019ve now resolved.", "Jimmy Addison", "Right.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "I think another was just \u2013 you needed to assume cost cutting which you seem to be doing extremely well. Maybe the industrial sales have been worse than you expected?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, yes\u2013", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "Is that a fair characterization of the gives and takes so far this year?", "Jimmy Addison", "It is. And the thing that I would say about the industrials is, if you remember our assumptions as we laid it out, we said what we did at the time that we gave guidance is we took every known; any plants that were idle at the time or any that have reduced production in any publicly known announcements, anything we knew from working with our customers. And we assumed that was at that level for the remainder of the year. So to the extent that some things got a little worse, in a few cases they have, that was not in our forecast. So that's a little bit of the downside.", "It's an interesting thing though. If you look in our press release, you see on the unit sales in industrials were down a little over 18%. But I would tell you \u2013 I would remind you that only about 12% of our electric margins come from industrials. And in the industrial contracts they all have minimum demand takes.", "And so our revenues are only down about half of that unit cost reduction. So for the units that were down about 18.5%, our revenue is only down about 9%. The cost of minimum takes are in all those contracts that are there to justify the investment of the equipment to initially serve the industrial customer.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "That's interesting.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. That helps moderate it, and fairly typical in the business.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "Okay. I guess just get one other question on the O&M savings. To degree that \u2013 let\u2019s say the economy stays as it is, quite weak, is this the kind of runway of O&M that could be potentially for the year? Or is this just \u2013 could it \u2013 it really is very significant savings.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, it is. And again, the bad debt was a significant piece of it. If the economy stays like this for a real extended period of time, even given the lower commodity cost and the benefit there, just pure credit quality will move that back up at some point directionally now. I don\u2019t know that it would move it back up to the same level of a year ago. But I do believe that directionally, we\u2019ll be in good shape compared to last year. I don't know if it will be quite \u2013 be able to maintain it quite at this level as we move throughout the year.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "And certainly, at some point I hope the economy starts to recover. I hope we're able to reconsider salary increases for the employee base. It's really, really working hard.", "Steve Fleishman \u2013 Catapult", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Hi, guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hello, Paul.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Not to focus too much on the O&M, but I noticed that unemployment rate in South Carolina was one of the biggest states \u2013 biggest increases for a state recently. I was wondering, was that in your conservative guidance in terms of what we might be seeing in terms of sales growth? And how does that impact commercial and residential?", "Jimmy Addison", "The unemployment rate is up above 10%. It is one of the highest in the nation. We made the assumption really at a high level based upon what we expected usage to be based on the recessionary signals we were seeing when we put the plan together and released guidance a couple of months ago. And it's been fairly close to that. We\u2019ve not seen a significant increase in conservation other than what we based the plan on earlier.", "In the markets that we serve principally \u2013 you're getting a state-wide unemployment right there in the markets that we serve from the electric business; principally Colombia, Charleston, Aiken, Augusta. I don't know the exact unemployment rates in those areas, but I think there's been more stability in those areas. Colombia itself is basically made up of State government, the army base \u2013 largest basic training army base in the country, and the university. And not a huge amount of corporate headquarters and things of that nature.", "And of course, Charleston has continued to perform fairly well. Some of the counties that we have very little service in have a 20 plus percent unemployment rate and there's very little population saturation in those counties. So it's really \u2013 a lot get lost in the average there. The short of it is, we still feel pretty good about our assumptions on the residential and commercial plan that we put together.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Then on the filing at the office of regulatory staff, the update, is it likely that they\u2019ll give you a substantial change? I'm just wondering, with everything that\u2019s happened in the market for commodity prices and everything else, I know you're blocking a lot of things but, might there be a change in that? Or can you give us any of the flavor for or do we just have to wait until it comes out?", "Jimmy Addison", "I'm not sure I understand your question.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "I guess what I'm asking is, the filing that you\u2019re going to be making, which I believe was an update of your CapEx, et cetera, correct?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. On May 15th", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Yes.", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "That's supposed to be an update. I'm wondering has there been a substantial change that you've seen in terms of your outlook with respect to the project?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, this is a routine filing that we\u2019re required to do every quarter. We make a filing.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Sure.", "Jimmy Addison", "We're not making it because we have some expected change. We\u2019re just making it because it's the first filing under the requirement. And we'll do that every quarter. I don't know of anything at this point that's a material change.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. I was just wondering if there's was any \u2013 if there\u2019d be a change in the outlook at all. And finally, with respect to the equity offering, it looks like you guys are set for 2009. When do you think will be the earliest time you\u2019d come back for a regular equity offering?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, Paul, as we discussed at our analyst day at V.C. Summer a few weeks ago, we do think we're set for 2009. The plan would say that we need somewhere slightly under $150 million in each of 2010 and 2011. Our philosophy is, you can look back and see, has been to not have to raise the capital. Not be backed in a corner and have to raise it at the 11th hour, either debt or equity. And we\u2019ll continue to monitor those markets. I\u2019m not trying to signal anything to you here. I\u2019m not trying to tell you to expect us to do that sooner than 2010. But we\u2019re going to keep our eye on the markets.", "I will tell you that we\u2019ve got \u2013 I believe we\u2019ve got more interest in our story than we\u2019ve have had in years. 150 people interested in our story a few weeks ago at the analyst day is over triple our normal quarterly call. They\u2019re more focused on the call today than they are normally. So I think there\u2019s more interest in our company.", "We\u2019ve got kind of reverse inquiries coming in for folks that have interest from both sides. And that\u2019s a good thing. I think our story\u2019s starting to get out. And people starting to really understand the details and all the legislative and regulatory support.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Jimmy Addison", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investments. Please proceed.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good afternoon.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "I was curious on the \u2013 you\u2019ve mentioned the filing with the PUC related to the \u2013 or the order from the PUC related to the FAC adjustment that you\u2019re going to recover over a three-year period.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "But what was the amount of that? And what\u2019s kind of the annual impact that you expect to that from the recovery?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. It\u2019s a little an excess of $100 million. I think around one-tenth and it would be spread over a three-year period. And of course, the way we do that is we project the forecasted sales over that period and divide it over the expected units. So that it\u2019s recovered over the three-year period. And the commission has allowed us a carrying cost since we\u2019ll be collecting years two and three outside of the statutory one year period.", "So I guess about \u2013 this really answers your question \u2013 about two-thirds of the $110 million being collected later than statutorily provided for so $70 million, or so.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. And what\u2019s the bottom line? Would that be pretty much a bottom line impact or some mark into it?", "Jimmy Addison", "There\u2019s no bottom line impact. There\u2019s just a timing on when it\u2019s collected. It\u2019s a full past through. It was all ruled as prudent so all the cost will be recovered. It\u2019s just a matter of timing.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. So it\u2019s more of a cash flow impact than earnings.", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s exactly right. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been allowed the interest periodic to recognize that it is in cash flow. It\u2019s our way of really reaching out to the customer\u2019s in this tough economic time.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. And then, I think on the clip filing, you mentioned that, I think, the end of October is when the first rated or bill impact would be seen.", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s correct.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "And will the bill impacts would then be quarterly with each filing or is that an annual impact? Or how often do the bills get adjusted as the clip is incurred?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right. It will be annual. The law provides that we can file every 12 months, but no earlier than that. So what will occur is we stay on this schedule, at the end of each May, we would make the filing. And by law, five months later we\u2019ll have new rates into effect. And between the period that the new rates were affected by the next filing, the following year we will accrue AFC on that balances, not including cash rates.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "What\u2019s the current balance of clip related to the nuclear?", "Jimmy Addison", "Let me see if I have that. I was discussing that with our board earlier today. I believe that number would be $400 million for the upcoming filing. It\u2019s not very significant from the public information we filed with Base Load Review Act. And I believe it\u2019s about $450 million.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. Yes. Go ahead.", "Jimmy Addison", "Which would yield somewhere around a 2.15% and 3.15% rate increase or about $50 million on an annual basis.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "So that was our projected amounts from the original filing. So the actual expenses will of course determine that\u2019ll be in the filing at May 30th.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Right. I was wondering if I could get a little more color on your electric margin. You talked about the weather benefits, but I was trying to know what was \u2013 if you could break out what this negative margin impact was from the lower industrials and the lower system margins?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. The industrials \u2013 the industrials were down about $0.02 per share and the residential and commercial were down about $0.04 per share so about $0.06 per share in total.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "How about the off-system?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. Off-system was off about $0.03. And of course that\u2019s just recognition of the economy around us as well as outside of our territory. So it appears that what we\u2019re purchasing a year ago are not purchasing today. They just don\u2019t have the need.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Right. Could you give a little color on just what are you seeing from your economy, in your service territory? Is it better, worst, the same? Let\u2019s say let\u2019s take the fourth quarter or first quarter and kind of progressing through the year, you seeing any signs of life or any changes one way or another?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, certainly as we were \u2013 as I was discussing a few minutes ago, the unemployment rate is higher statewide. We have seen a mixture of some industrials \u2013 some additional industrial kind of idling of facilities or cutting back of facilities. We\u2019ve seen some \u2013 recently some announcements of a few industrial focus of expansions so things of that nature. So there\u2019s really a mixture right now. I really would not characterize it much different than what I read nationally.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And your next question comes from the line of Chris Shelton of Millennium. Please proceed.", "Chris Shelton \u2013 Millennium", "Hey, guys. I was wondering \u2013 following up on a couple of questions. If you could break out \u2013 It sounds like you\u2019re fairly confident around the residential usage that you saw this quarter. But whether there was an impact \u2013 I was wondering is their a weather normalized residential usage that you could share? I mea, was it flat? Maybe directionally, maybe that\u2019s easier?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, overall, you need to add \u2013 you need to take away $0.03 per share to get to the weather normalized earnings for the quarter. So the 94 would have been 91 and of course, that\u2019s on a diluted basis. So there\u2019s a $0.04 bad back If you assume same number of shares. That would take you back to 95, but that\u2019s kind of an overall basis. That considers all of those categories.", "Chris Shelton \u2013 Millennium", "Okay. And I guess, I was thinking more on just usage trend versus last year are residentials using about the same, or less, or more or \u2013 on weather normalized basis.", "Jimmy Addison", "The residentials are definitely using less. We estimated when we put our plan together, we assumed that the trend would be fairly consistent with the fourth quarter, which is where we were seeing a 1% to 2% reduction in usage. So we have definitely seen that continue in to 2009. The thing is offsetting that is very important for us and different than some of our fears. As we continue to see growth in each of the businesses.", "Chris Shelton \u2013 Millennium", "Yes.", "Jimmy Addison", "And in the first quarter alone, SCE&G electric we added 2,400 customers. That\u2019s not as many as 2008, but it\u2019s about two-thirds as many as we added in the first quarter or \u201908. In the gas business, we added 1,700 customers, almost three-quarters of what we did a year ago. In the North Carolina gas business, we added 1,200. That\u2019s down less than half of what it was a year ago, but the nice thing is we\u2019ve got growth in each of this regulated businesses.", "Again, Energy, I\u2019ve talked about a couple of months ago about fairly aggressive campaign there. We\u2019ve added 6,400 customers in the first quarter over in our Georgia marketing business. So that\u2019s really helping mitigate and that was part of our plan was to use this existing temporary growth to offset some of the usage decline on a per customer basis.", "Chris Shelton \u2013 Millennium", "Got it. Helpful. And just one clarification, the one that you present \u2013 usage reduction you guys have predicted, is that overall retail or is it just residential?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, that\u2019s really related to residential and commercial.", "Chris Shelton \u2013 Millennium", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. We really took an approach on the industrial so at least all the large ones are the customer-by-customer basis. We have so much interaction on that.", "Chris Shelton \u2013 Millennium", "Got it. Thank you very much, guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jim Ferguson of AIG. Please proceed.", "Jim Ferguson \u2013 AIG", "Hello. Question on your funding requirements in 2010 and 2011. Could you comment on the issuance or potential issuance of debt at the holding company to meet some of those needs?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. We don\u2019t have any needs outside of SCE&G for debt until at least two years from now. We don\u2019t have any in the balance of 2009 or 2010. And the only need we have in 2011 would be a refinancing of expected maturity in that timeframe. So there\u2019s no new data at all there.

(NYSE:SCG) Q2 2009 Earnings Call July 30, 2009  2:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Jimmy Addison - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Kevin Marsh - President of SCE&G", "Betty Best - Director of Financial Planning & Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Chris Ellinghaus - Shields & Company", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo", "Vedula Murti - CDP", "Marc De Croisset - Macquarie", "Operator", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. My name is Heather, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call. (Operator Instructions)", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Betty Best, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Betty Best", "Thanks, Heather and good afternoon. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. Earlier today, we announced financial results for the second of 2009.", "In just a minute, Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G, will review those results, address key operational issues, then respond to questions. The earnings press release that we will refer to in this conference call is available on our website at SCANA.com.", "I would like to remind everyone that certain statements that may be made during today\u2019s call which are not statements of historical fact are considered forward-looking statements, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Betty and good afternoon. I would also like to welcome each of you to our call. SCANA reported second quarter earnings of $55 million or $0.45 per share, compared to $57 million or $0.48 per share in the second quarter of 2008. This $0.03 decline was due primarily to share dilution and lower electric margins, which more than offset reduced O&M expenses and customer growth.", "We conservatively based our 2009 plan on no growth in customers, and are therefore pleased we are seeing continued customer growth in our electric service territory. However, this growth has been more than offset by reduced customer consumption as a result of the economic slowdown. While we have not yet seen a definitive turnaround, South Carolina\u2019s jobless rate remained relatively unchanged in June from May, and we have recently seen an improvement in housing starts.", "For the first sixth months of 2009, we reported earnings of $1.39 per share, compared to $1.42 per share for the same period in 2008. This year-to-date $0.03 per share decrease in earnings is similarly due to dilution and lower consumption. This more than offset favorable weather, which accounted for $0.05 year-to-date and $0.02 for the quarter compared to normal.", "Although I don\u2019t have any specific degree day statistics to share with you at this point, I should add that we have seen a mild July, which could bring our year-to-date weather earnings impact back to the more normal range going forward. On a year-to-date basis, we estimate that consumers have reduced consumption by approximately 2.5% or $16 million. While we continue to add approximately 2,200 net new electric customers each quarter, these additions can\u2019t offset the impact of the economy on a customer base of 650,000.", "We are unsure how long these changes in consumer behavior patterns will continue, but we\u2019re encouraged with the results of efforts we have taken to offset the financial impact. For example, in April we announced that SCE&G and the City of Orangeburg reached an agreement for SCE&G to continue serving wholesale electric power needs through December 2010.", "That contract is for approximately 190 megawatts of capacity and is expected to generate an additional $0.06 of earnings for the additional eight months of 2009, or $0.04 for the second half of the year. Additionally, some of the cost control efforts company has undertaken include lower contractor usage, reduced overtime and no salary increases for salaried employees in 2009 to-date, and limiting our spending to what is needed to maintain reliability, safety and customer service. These efforts have yielded $22 million of savings over 2008 levels.", "Now I\u2019d like to review second quarter results for our principal lines of business. As a reminder, the large majority of our operations are regulated. These regulated utility businesses, SCE&G, PSNC and CGT, collectively represent more than 90% of the company\u2019s total assets and annual earnings per share.", "South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, our largest subsidiary, reported earnings of $59 million, or $0.49 per share, compared to $61 million or $0.52 per share in the same quarter of last year. The $0.03 decrease is attributable to share dilution and lower electric margins, which more than offset lower O&M expenses and customer growth.", "On June 15, SCE&G submitted its quarterly filing to the Public Service Commission as required under the Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act. In that filing, the company reported that its return on common equity for the 12 month period ended March 31, 2009 was 6.36%, compared to an allowed return of 10.25%.", "Since the actual return on equity was more than 50 basis points below the allowed return, SCE&G requested a 2.5% increase in its rates in order to restore return on equity to the 10.25% authorized level. This request would produce an estimated $13.4 million annually, and is driven primarily by increased costs associated with building, operating and maintaining SCE&G\u2019s system infrastructure.", "Following a required audit of the company\u2019s filing by the Office of Regulatory Staff, the PSC will review both the company\u2019s request and the ORS audit report and issue its order on our request in October. The rate adjustment would be effective with the first billing cycle in November. At June 30, 2009, SCE&G was serving approximately 307,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 1.3% over the last 12 months.", "PSNC Energy, our retail natural gas distribution company in North Carolina, reported seasonal breakeven earnings for the second quarter of 2009, compared to a loss of $1 million or $0.01 per share in the same quarter of 2008. That improvement was due mainly to new rates effective in November of last year and customer growth.", "At June 30, 2009, PSNC was serving approximately 461,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 1.6% over the last 12 months. Carolina Gas Transmission, our interstate natural gas transmission subsidiary, reported earnings of $0.02 per share, unchanged from the same quarter last year. CGT continues to deliver very consistent earnings each quarter from its transportation-only business model. ", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a seasonal loss of $3 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2009, compared to a seasonal loss of $1 million or $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2008. This decline is due primarily to share dilution, lower volumes and increased reserves for bad debts. At June 30, 2009, SCANA Energy was serving approximately 447,000 customers in Georgia, maintaining its position as the second largest natural gas market in this state. ", "SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses, which include SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported a combined loss of $3 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to a loss of $4 million or $0.04 per share in the same quarter last year.", "Regarding earnings guidance, we are reaffirming our 2009 guidance of $2.65 to $2.95 per share and continue to target a long term average annual earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%. We believe that was continued uncertainty in the economy and considering the criticality of the third quarter cooling season, it\u2019s premature to adjust our guidance at this time.", "Keep in mind, that our guidance assumes normal weather in our electric and natural gas service areas for the remainder of the year and excludes any potential impact from changes in accounting principles and certain gains and losses from investing activities, litigation and sales of assets. Other factors that may impact future earnings are discussed in our SEC filings.", "With regards to our liquidity position, at June 30, we had approximately $375 million in cash on hand and another $500 million available to us available under our lines of credit. While it was prudent to maintain a conservative cash position until the soundness of the financial system could be assured, we believe that the financial markets are regaining stability and as a result in July, we began decreasing our cash on hand and commensurate borrowings under our credit facility.", "Thus, we current will have approximately $100 million in cash and $700 million available in liquidity. Additionally, we recently closed on a $100 million private placement at PSNC to add to our long term liquidity. This facility has a delayed draw feature, so we have not yet withdrawn the funds, but will ultimately reduce our levels of outstanding commercial paper, providing for more net liquidity in the long run.", "We\u2019ve recently concluded our annual review process with all three credit rating agencies. Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded SCANA and its rated subsidiaries One Notch with the exception of SCE&G\u2019s senior secured debt, which remains at A-minus. The long term outlook was revised from negative to stable. ", "Fixed Ratings downgraded SCANA and its rated subsidiaries One Notch and revised the long term outlook from negative to stable. Finally, Moody\u2019s downgraded SCANA and SCE&G One Notch affirm the ratings for PSNC and South Carolina Fuel Company and revised its long term outlook for SCANA and its rated subsidiaries from stable to negative.", "The common theme of the agencies was lessened the credit metrics due to CapEx and the related debt and the overall increased business risk associated with the nuclear build. Due to the long construction cycle of building a nuclear plant, all three agencies have stated that they are taking a more conservative approach to companies that are planning to build nuclear plants.", "Nevertheless, despite these recent actions, we still maintain solid investment grade ratings, and most importantly, a senior secured debt rating of A-minus or higher at SCE&G, where our nuclear debt financings will occur. These downgrades have not had a material impact on SCE&G\u2019s first mortgage bond spreads, so we don\u2019t feel there are significant financial implications from these rating actions.", "In summary, we remain very committed to our new nuclear strategy and we will continue to work to achieve our stated financial and operational goals. A complete listing of the credit ratings for SCANA and its rated subsidiaries is available in our earnings press release. Turning now to nuclear regulatory matters, there are three recent state regulatory filings I would like Kevin Marsh, the President of SCE&G, to brief you on.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to, Kevin.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks, Jimmy, and good afternoon. On May 15, we filed our first quarterly status report with the Office of Regulatory Staff as required under our recent base load review order. This report provides a detailed update of our capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our nuclear project. On July 14, the ORS submitted their review of this filing. A copy of the SCE&G report is available on our website.", "On May 29, we submitted our initial annual revised rate adjustment filing with the Commission for the annual recovery of financing costs related to CWIP. The requested rate adjustments are based on the incremental CWIP incurred from the July 20, 2008 filings for June 30, 2009, and are based on the updated capital structure with the ROE set at 11%. We expect new rates under this filing will go into effect on October 30 of this year.", "Earlier today, the Office of Regulatory Staff filed their recommendation related to our initial annual revised rate adjustment request. $22.5 million or 1.1% is the requested revenue amount, which is also the recommendation by the Office of Regulatory Staff for new rates. Their report supporting our filing will be posted on the PSC website later today.", "Finally, on July 20, we filed an update of construction progress and request for updates and revisions to schedules with the South Carolina PSC. This filing request that the Commission issue an order approving an updated construction and capital cost schedule for the construction of the two nuclear units.", "Our initial regulatory approval of the project was based on a generic Westinghouse AP-1000 schedule; and since that time, we have received a refined site-specific construction schedule from Westinghouse-Shaw, shifting the sequencing of milestones within the currently approved project schedule The updated schedule outlines the details of the construction and capital cost schedule beyond what was in our original filing in May of 2008.", "With this new filing, we are requesting approval to adopt the updated schedule as the official schedule for the project, replacing the one filed in 2008. This refined schedule does not change our commitment to construct and complete the two units by April 1, of 2016, and January 1, of 2019, nor does it change the previously announced cost of $4.53 billion in 2007, but rather better matches the cost of the years expected to be incurred. This schedule also supports the previously disclosed $400 million shift in CapEx from 2009 to 2011 into future years.", "That concludes our prepared remarks, and Jimmy and I will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "I was wondering, on the updated schedule you just talked about for the nuclear project, will that be filed, like in an 8-K or something? Will we have some access to seeing what that new schedule is?", "Jimmy Addison", "I believe that Dan, that\u2019s already out on the PSC\u2019s website. If you go to the South Carolina PSC, you can find it there.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "I missed the amount you said that the dollar amount of the increase that you are expecting related to the clip filing?", "Jimmy Addison", "With the revised rate filing?", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "The clip filing for the nuclear?", "Jimmy Addison", "It\u2019s about 1.1%, around $23 million.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Then I was curious, on page six of your release, for the electric operations, the wholesale was up 13% in the quarter. What was driving that?", "Jimmy Addison", "Let me make sure, I\u2019m with you on your question, which, page six?", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Page six up there at the top, under the KWH sales. For wholesale, it was up 13.2% for the second quarter, to 541 from 478.", "Jimmy Addison", "The issue there was is really a comparison issue. Last year in this quarter, our nuclear plant was down for an extended refueling outage. So there was very little capacity to sell. Even though the economy is off this year, we have more capacity available to sell. Contrary to that is we\u2019ve made significantly less on it. The margins are much lower this year, but we had more to sell in volumes, and you\u2019re looking at volumes there.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Then similarly, if you go down then and look at the natural gas operations, you had a 5.7% increase in the industrial sales, which given the economic environment, seems kind of contrary like you would expect, so what?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, I agree with you. I asked that same question myself, when I first saw it. That\u2019s primarily through SCANA Energy Marketing. Our subsidiary that sells to other industrials and to other power generators, and that\u2019s gas sold for electric generation for to other electric generators. That\u2019s because of the low cost of gas compared with coal and others are using more gas, as we are.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Kind of the last thing I was wondering about, you talked a little bit about the rating agencies completing their review, and all of them decided to downgrade you, and Moody\u2019s left with you a negative outlook. ", "I guess my question is, is there some level that you\u2019re willing to defend as far as a rating if they decide that, given the big nuclear construction program and the access you\u2019re going to need to capital? Is there some point where you\u2019d be willing to issue equity to protect the rating, and kind of what your philosophy is going to be going forward?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, that\u2019s been our plan all along. As we\u2019ve stated, our plan is to keep a single A minus rating on the first mortgage bond at SCE&G, where we\u2019re going to be issuing all of the debt. We have a plan already, as we\u2019ve discussed, around equity. This was not a surprise to us. So this is part of our plan is to issue equitably, ratably along the way as the project develops. We\u2019ve not changed what we\u2019ve previously disclosed there. We really want to stay at that A level.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "So your current ratings are kind of your target level throughout the process? Would that be fair to say?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, that\u2019s fair to say based on the dynamics of the market today now. Who knows, \u201cWhat the future will hold?\u201d For example, I could take you back to a couple of years ago, and the difference between a single A and a triple B rating was negligible in the cost of the bond.", "So it really wasn\u2019t worth anything at that point, but based upon what we see in today\u2019s market, which is really different, that is our judgment now. One thing is for sure, the project this long, the dynamics at a macro level will change, and we\u2019ll have to adjust to those, but at this point, it feels like it\u2019s very much worthwhile keeping the rating.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Ellinghaus - Shields & Company.", "Chris Ellinghaus - Shields & Company", "Can you give us any kind of update on NRC or loan guarantees?", "Jimmy Addison", "I\u2019ll respond to loan guarantees, and let Kevin maybe speak to NRC. I don\u2019t know what, if there\u2019s anything there on NRC. On loan guarantees, really not a lot has happened since the last time we called. We\u2019ve had a meeting with the DOE back; I think it was actually right before our last quarterly call. We\u2019re getting them everything they need.", "We continue to have our credit assessment done by one of the rating agencies, and they need that in order to give us the first look at a term sheet. We\u2019ll have to start evaluating from that point. So nothing has really changed on the loan guarantees at this point. I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, I\u2019ll review. Our work with the NRC continues. They continue to have resources, reviewing our license application for the COL, which we still expect it to get issued in the mid to latter part of 2011. ", "We are responding to a lot of information, or requests to them they call RAIs, or requests for additional information. So Westinghouse continues to work with them on the design certification document number 17 as they try to get that revision through, which will be the last revision to this engineering design for the plant as we move forward.", "We have daily interaction with them. I was in a review meeting just last week with both Westinghouse and Shaw, and we are pleased with where we are at this point, and pleased with the level of cooperation between our team and theirs, and the level of interaction with the NRC. ", "I think the best thing I can tell you as the process continues, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of information that\u2019s being shared to make sure we respond to any questions they have. So we can stay on schedule for the issuance of the COL.", "Chris Ellinghaus - Shields & Company", "Jimmy, I think you said something about higher bad debt expense at SCANA Energy. Is the economy\u2019s impact that great, that it\u2019s offsetting the lower natural gas prices that much?", "Jimmy Addison", "It is. It really has. It\u2019s turned a little in the second quarter, in Georgia especially. Our read and of course, the vast majority of our business 90 plus percentage in the Carolinas, but Georgia is a much more difficult market. ", "We\u2019ve seen it turn in the second quarter. The other dynamic, if you\u2019re in the gas business is, you\u2019ve got much more leverage to get the gas bill paid in the first quarter than you do in the second quarter, because it gets warm in the south in the second quarter, they\u2019re not nearly as motivated to pay. When I say they\u2019re higher, they\u2019re a couple million dollars higher than a year ago, so it\u2019s not outrageous, but it certainly been mitigated by the lower gas prices.", "Chris Ellinghaus - Shields & Company", "Can you add any color to the economy in the Carolinas other than what you said?", "Jimmy Addison", "To repeat first what I said, just to recap. We\u2019re hopeful that things are near the bottom. The jobless rate really didn\u2019t change. I think it went up 10 basis points or something from May to June. We\u2019ve seen more housing starts so we continue to add customers in every one of our regulated businesses in the Carolinas. So that\u2019s a good thing, but it\u2019s not like that we see anything radically different than the national economy at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Most of my questions have been answered, but the $400 million that I think you mentioned from 2009 to 2011 that\u2019s now going to be coming in later years. Could you explain a little bit more about that?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. Paul, that\u2019s really due to that schedule shift. Kevin talked earlier about the filing we made with the PSC, and we\u2019ve gone from a very generic schedule when we first filed our proceeding with the Commission last fall, to a site-specific schedule now for the BC summer units two and three.", "Once they got that granular, it resulted not the overall dollars changing, but in moving out some of the dollars related to milestones that moved out in future years. So if you aggregate 2009, \u201810 and \u201811, the three years that we\u2019ve disclosed publicly, you\u2019d take $400 million off an aggregate to move them out into years \u201812 forward.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "What about the site-specific? Is the site-specific review caused, I guess, the $400 million caused that shift? Just a number, or is it easy to calculate?", "Kevin Marsh", "In our detailed work with Westinghouse, as we\u2019ve tried to finalize the schedule, we wanted to ship, what reasonable amount we could, after that 2011 timeframe, which would get us past the COL approval. ", "While we fully expect to have the license approval by that time, we didn\u2019t want to make any more investment in equipment than was necessary to keep the project on schedule and on time, and working with Westinghouse as they finalized the final schedule with Shaw, we were successful in doing that. That\u2019s why we went back and revised those milestones with the Commission.", "It\u2019s not indicative of a problem or a delay in the project, as I said. The initial schedule that was filed with the Public Service Commission was a very generic schedule. As we tailored that schedule to our project and our site and our circumstances, we were able to refine that. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve taken back to the Commission, and that\u2019s consistent with the shift in the capital dollars.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Travis Miller - Morningstar.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "My question on the usage declines in the industrial side. How does that affect revenue? Can you give us an idea of the sensitivities around, to say 1% drop in industrial usage, corresponding to an X percent drop in revenues?", "Jimmy Addison", "I can\u2019t give you anything in that kind of a matrix. Generally, the contracts are all different. Generally, the commonality between them is that there\u2019s a demand charge associated with these contracts and just because you reduce your consumption or you take out the system, it doesn\u2019t mean that revenue is going to go down.", "Generally, these use a look back provision, when they look back over the last year and look at the peak usage by the customer during that period. So it would take, you\u2019d have to get out past a one year sustained economic downturn before it would kind of reset that lower level of peak that would allow if you will, the dollar level of the decrease to equal the KWH decrease.", "Kevin Marsh", "You would also have customers on the flipside of that. Interruptible customers, when you have a fairly thin margins just based on the structure of that contract. So if they were to leave or reduce some of their take on the system, you don\u2019t see nearly the impact you would from a residential or commercial firm application.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Generally, what is the percentage of the total charge that corresponds to the demand charge is your rough\u2026?", "Kevin Marsh", "It really varies based on the type of business. It might be half for a steel plant and very different for a chemical plant. They run very fundamentally different operations. I couldn\u2019t give you a rule of thumb that would apply to all of the industries.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Related to that, has there been a benefit potentially from the mix shift that you\u2019ve seen over the last two years?", "Kevin Marsh", "If you\u2019re talking about having low industrial and more residential? If you were growing more on the residential side while you lose industrial load, you could potentially see an impact. That\u2019s not been the case. From where we are in the residential, it\u2019s been relatively stable until the economic impact hit here last year. For every kilowatt hour, we had lost on the industrial side, if we could transfer that to residential and commercial, I think you would see a market increase.", "Jimmy Addison", "If you look at our base overall, I mean half of our margins come from residential and about another third from the commercial segment. So there is not as exposed to the industrial margins. For example, it was here in the south 20 years ago, when manufacturing was much more prevalent. It\u2019s now much more consumer oriented.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "One quick clarification too, on that 22.5 million revenue request on October 30?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "That would be effective on that date, right?", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s correct. The law is, we make the filing May 30, within five months. They have to issue their order with the new rates End of October.", "Kevin Marsh", "I will go back and add one more statement to that shift between industrial and residential. Overtime, that change would diminish, because as we file updated cost of service studies with the Public Service Commission, they would reallocate the costs that would also be shifted to the residential class overtime, and it would pretty much balance out. You\u2019re going to earn your return on your authorized investment by the Commission, but then you go through a process of allocating the costs by class and the relative revenues that come with them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo", "I was hoping you guys could update us a little bit what you\u2019re thinking as far as intermediate generation meets. I know before you were saying they were going to be mitigated until the nuclear units came online due to the rolling off of some wholesale contracts. Has your thought process kind of changed there at all? Or the shift in expected demand due to the economy has that replaced any potential need there?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, we had arrangements in 2008 to purchase a hundred megawatts firm supply during the summer had we needed that supply. We did need that in 2008.", "With the change in accounting for 2009, while we have those same reserve requirements out there. We have not found it necessary to pool on that and based on what we see as we go through this recovery period, we\u2019ll have to watch that from year-to-year. I don\u2019t see anything that would require us to go out and build intermediate generation at this point.", "Based on what we know today, I think we\u2019ll have to watch very carefully as the economy recovers at how strong the actual sales come back as we do recover, but even in our plan before we saw the economy go down, we didn\u2019t have any major generation construction plans. ", "We were going to cover that by dropping the City of Orangeburg wholesale contract, or allowing it to expire, as well as a contract we have with the North Carolina EMCs that expires in 2012. Those will continue to be the pieces that we would look at to manage that load requirement.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo", "Then could you also discuss what, if any base electric rate case plans you have beyond just the nuclear recovery filings? Do you expect to file anything later this year in 2010?", "Kevin Marsh", "Jimmy has talked earlier in the year about our need to seek recovery for some of the investments we\u2019ve made and environmental abatement investments, primarily scrubbers on two of our large coal-fired plants. We\u2019ve got about $500 million and invested in those pieces of equipment. At some point, we\u2019ll need to go in and seek recovery of that. I would also say, in addition to that, we\u2019re watching carefully what our expense levels do.", "As we come to the economy, where we do still have a base level of spending we\u2019ll need to do to meet the growth on the system so we do continue to have growth. If that continues, we\u2019ll likely need to have some rate relief on that front, too. We don\u2019t do anything this year that would result in any increases for 2009. Understanding how the process works, if we were to file today, it\u2019s six months before that increase would go into effect.", "So we\u2019ve passed the date that anything would go into effect in 2009. I think Jimmy has discussed earlier, that we\u2019ll look as we get towards the end of the year about the timing of those filings and how they may be structured, but it\u2019s too early to put any numbers on those at this time for a definite timeframe.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo", "The possibility that you have an impact for 2010 is definitely still open?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Vedula Murti - CDP.", "Vedula Murti - CDP", "A couple of things one, I if I heard your commentary properly, I think you indicated that third quarter weather-wise is off to a slow start and that it\u2019s premature at this point, given the leverage of summer, to make any adjustments for your earnings outlook. Does that imply at this point, that you\u2019re towards the bottom half of the range in terms of where you\u2019re at this point?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, it doesn\u2019t imply that at all. It doesn\u2019t imply either direction. We\u2019re still comfortable with the range.", "Vedula Murti - CDP", "Okay, because you did imply, though, that because August, or because July here is off to a slow start that if current conditions continue to persist, that it wouldn\u2019t necessitate, it couldn\u2019t necessitate a change.", "Jimmy Addison", "The other thing, though that we discussed both earlier today and last quarter is that we added the Orangeburg contract that was not in our original guidance, and that adds $0.06 per share to 2009 earnings.", "Vedula Murti - CDP", "Secondarily, can you talk about how the shifting of $400 million from the 2009 to 2011 period to out years is going to affect your financing plans in the next two years going forward, especially since you took care of a large amount of equity here at the beginning of this year?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, as we said earlier, we really don\u2019t have any other equity needs for the balance of this year. We did what we felt we needed to do at the beginning of the year. Now, the only exception to that is we continue to issue each quarter new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and our dividend reinvestment plans.", "So that would generate about another $40 million to $45 million in the second half of the year. We don\u2019t have any follow on plans in the balance of this year. We think we\u2019re in good shape there. We\u2019ve got one debt deal to do later in the year. Right now that\u2019s somewhere between $150 million and $200 million, based on the shift that Kevin talked about, we really only have one debt deal to do next year. I think that\u2019s about $150 million or so.", "So the next couple of years are not huge capital need years and the big benefit is bringing in this additional cash each year through the Base Load Review Act. That\u2019s the benefit of it for the long term of the customers, is it doesn\u2019t add this compounding AFC and put you in a huge capital raising need. It funds part of that capital itself.", "So the increase we\u2019ll get this October will help. The increase we get next October will help. Really on the equity side, nothing has changed from our earlier plan that said that our strategy was to finance about half and half equity and debt, and based upon that, we would estimate equity needs next year, in addition to the stock plans of about $130 million to $150 million and the same for the following year.", "Vedula Murti - CDP", "So even though we\u2019re pushing off $400 million, that doesn\u2019t push that part of it off into back end, either that remains unchanged?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. We\u2019re going to do is to try to really take this opportunity to stick to that plan and work towards strengthening the balance sheet a little bit back to protecting those long term ratings.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Marc De Croisset - Macquarie.", "Marc De Croisset - Macquarie", "I think Vedula asked the question essentially. I want to just make sure I understand. You are shifting out $400 million of capital expenditures past 2011, past the COL, but your financing plan still reflects $300 million of external equity beyond your drip? Is that correct?", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "What was the actual weather impact versus normal for the first six months?", "Jimmy Addison", "It was $0.05 in total for the first six months, $0.03 in the first quarter and $0.02 in the second.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "That\u2019s versus normal?", "Jimmy Addison", "Versus normal.", "Operator", "As there are no further questions in the queue at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jimmy Addison for closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you for everyone\u2019s attention today to the call. I think we had another good quarter. The second quarter is essentially only 15% of our annual plan, but based upon the shoulder months and the composition of our businesses. So if you take our total earnings, only about 15% fall within that second quarter are expected to. ", "So we don\u2019t expect it to be a huge quarter, but we\u2019re very pleased with the mitigating effects that we\u2019ve been able to have on the effects of the top line from the economy. We thank you for all your interest. If you have got additional questions, feel free to contact our Investor Relations. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Thank you for standing by. My name is Ken and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday October 27, 2009. Anyone who does not consent the taping may drop off the line at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Betty Best, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Betty Best", "Thanks, Ken and good morning. I like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call including those who are joining us on the webcast. Earlier today, we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2009. In just a minute, Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review those results and respond to questions.", "Also on the call today will be Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G and Steve Byrne SCANA's Chief Nuclear Officer giving updates on certain operational issues and our new nuclear program. The earnings press release that we refer to in this conference call is available on our website at scana.com. I would to like to remind everyone that certain statements that may be made during today's call, which are not statements such historical fact are considered as forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Including the risks and uncertainties discussed in the Company's SEC filings. The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy Addison.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks Betty and good morning. I would also like to welcome each of you to our call. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.84 per share, up from $0.80 per share in the same quarter of 2008. The $0.04 per share improvement was primarily a result of the resolution of the state income tax issue that more than offset lower electric and natural gas margins, slightly higher operations and maintenance expenses and expected dilution for the quarter.", "A brief comment about the $3 million or $0.02 per share O&M increase. As you know we have made costs control a central focus during this recession in order to maintain earnings and mitigate the impact on customers of a potential rate increase. Although O&M has increased compared to the third quarter of last year, its result at an abnormally low level of incentive compensation costs in the prior year due to the performance of our stock during that period. This low level of cost was substantially reversed in the fourth quarter when the stock performed much better relative to our peers. This difference in incentive compensation accruals resulted in about $5 million or $0.03 per share additional O&M costs this quarter compared to third quarter of 2008.", "For the quarter, we continue to see the impact of the recessionary economy on electric margins resulting in reduced commercial consumption and lower industrial and off-system sales compared to last year. However, we've seen a fairly consistent trend in recent months as opposed to further degradation and don't expect to see further declines as we head into 2010.", "For the first nine months of 2009, we reported earnings of $2.23 per share compared to $2.22 per share for the same period in 2008. This $0.01 per share increase in earnings was driven primarily by lower O&M expenses and the favorable resolution of the state income tax issue offset by dilution and lower consumption.", "Based on year-to-date results and our expectations of the results for the fourth quarter, we are narrowing our 2009 guidance to the upper half of our previously stated range. Specifically, we now expect to earn between $2.80 and $2.95 per share.", "Keep in mind our earnings guidance assumes normal weather in our electric and natural gas service areas for the remainder of 2009 and excludes any potential impact from changes in accounting principles and certain gains or losses from investing activities, litigation and sales of assets. Other factors that may impact future earnings are discussed in our SEC filings.", "As it relates to next year, due to the continuing economic uncertainty, we are not yet providing earnings guidance for 2010. We do expect to provide guidance when we report our full year 2009 earnings in February.", "Now I would like to review the third quarter results of our principle lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, our largest subsidiary reported earnings of $109 million or $0.89 per share compared to $100 million or $0.85 per share in the same quarter last year. The $0.04 increase is attributable to the resolution of the state tax issue which more than offset lower electric margins and dilution. As of September 30, SCE&G was serving approximately 654,000 electric customers which represents a 0.8% increase over the past year. Over that same period SCE&G's natural gas customer base increased 1.2% to approximately 306,000 customers.", "With regard to state income tax issue, in 1996 based on construction activity at our coke plant we are in an Economic Impact Zone or EIZ tax credit from the state of South Carolina. This EIG credit far exceeded SCANA's state tax liability for the 1996 tax year leaving approximately $15 million of the credit unused. SCANA carry forward the unused EIZ credit earned to its 1997 and 1998 tax returns; but the South Carolina Department of Revenue contested that carry forward application. We pursued the issue and ultimately won an appeal with the South Carolina Supreme Court link that the EIZ credit earned, but not used by SCANA in 1996 may indeed be applied to its tax liability for 1997 and 1998.", "Prior to this favorable Supreme Court decision and pursuant to the relevant accounting literature, concerning income tax uncertainties, the value of the contested credit had not been reflected in our income statement. This decision resolves the issue in our favor and resulted in $0.11 per share impact in the third quarter which includes a portion of the tax refund as well as the related interest income. This benefit is reflected in the income statement inline items for income taxes, for the tax benefit and other income for the interest income.", "Considering the impact of this tax benefit, we estimate SCANA's effective tax rate for 2009 to be approximately 31%. Although we have received the tax refund of $15 million in cash along with the related interest income, the rest of the credit itself will be recognized for accounting purposes, over the remaining line for the plant that gave rise to the credit. The multiyear catch-up for the life of the plant today results in the tax reduction recognized this quarter. The recognition of the remaining tax benefit in future years will not materially impact our effective tax rate.", "PSNC Energy a retail natural gas company in North Carolina reported their seasonal loss of $4 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2009, unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2008. Reduced margins have been mitigated by excellent cost control. At September 30, 2009 PSNC Energy was serving approximately 460,000 customers an increase of 1.2% over the last 12 months.", "Carolina Gas Transmission, our interstate natural gas transmission subsidiary reported earnings of $0.03 per share compared to $0.02 per share in the same quarter last year. This increase is attributable to slightly higher transportation revenues and lower O&M expenses.", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a loss of $3 million or $0.02 per share, compared to breakeven results in the same quarter of 2008. This decline is due primarily to a shift in this marketplace as more customers have opted for fixed rate pricing plans to lock in recent lower natural gas prices. These fixed rate plans generally result in lower margins, as their terms are known and the gas costs can be hedged. I should also note one benefit of lower natural gas prices is reduced bad debt expenses as customers are better able to pay their substantially reduced gas bills.", "Based upon current gas prices, we expect this shift in customer preference to continue and we prospectively forecast this business to earn approximately $0.20 to $0.22 per share annually, assuming normal weather. SCANA Energy continues to be a well-run business with very little hedge and it has responded well to this market shift as evidenced by a continued strong market position and profitability. One potential positive for this business is the $175 million pipeline infrastructure improvement program requested by Atlanta Gas Light Company and recently approved by the Georgia PSC.", "In addition, the commission is considering a new economic development program proposed by SCANA Energy and Atlanta Gas Light which would help to expand pipelines to new areas throughout Georgia. As many of you are aware, the cost of the light pipeline system expansion this market has only grown at approximately 1.5 of 1% per year since it was open to competition in the late 99, contrasting to do to the 2 to 4 plus percent customer growth rates we have seen in our Carolina's that will be seize. At September 30, 2009, SCANA Energy was serving more than 440,000 customers in Georgia maintaining its position as a second largest natural gas marketer in the state.", "SCANA's Corporate and other businesses reported a combined loss of $2 million or $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $4 million or $0.03 per share in the same quarter last year. This $0.1 per share improvement was driven primarily by lower net interest expense related to the reduction of long-term debt and its maturity in late 2008.", "I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G for an update on several operational and regulatory issues.", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Thanks Jimmy. I want to take a few minutes to update you on several important items taking place in SCE&G. Recently, we're calling our recent Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act filing and decision the South Carolina Commission approved a $13 million increase in SCE&G's retail gas base rates. This action was in response to our June 15th annual filing made under the Rate Stabilization Act in which the company reported as for total common equity for the 12 month period in March 31, 2009 was 6.36%.", "Since our actual return on equity was more than 50 basis points below the allowed return of 10.25%, SCE&G requested a 2.5% increase and it's rates in order to restore the oil lead to the authorized level as provided under the law. The new rates will be effective for bills rendered only after the first billing cycle in November.", "From an operating perspective, V.C. Summer Nuclear Station recently completed its most successful 18 month operating cycle in its 25 year history. The plant set a continuous run record of 475 days and employees at the site surpassed 5.5 million consecutive safe work hours. Although the plant set a new record for continuous run, it did experience an automotive shutdown on October 2nd due to a fall on a generator output breaker on the non-nuclear side of the plant. Repair and testing of the breaker was completed in 10 days allowing the plant to restart on the evening of October, 12th. On October 16, Summer Station began its 18th regular schedule refilling outage; bringing the outage approximately one-third of the plant's uranium fuel centers will be replaced and normal preventative  maintenance work will be performed.", "Earlier this year, we initiated a proceeding before the Public Service Commission of South Carolina which would allow SCE&G to provide the Commission with an update of the progress in the licensing infrastructure of our two new nuclear units to be located at the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station at Jenkinsville, South Carolina.", "In addition, we requested an owner approving updated construction and capital cost schedules for the construction of the new units. Updated construction schedule is a site specific schedule for our particular project and will replace the generic AP100 Westinghouse construction milestone schedule included in the initial 2008 Base Load Review Act filing.", "The V.C. Summer site specific construction schedule for Westinghouse (inaudible) realized a significant milestones and better outlast the details of the construction and capital costs schedules beyond those approved by the Commission earlier this year. This refined schedule does not change our commitment to construct and complete the two units by 2016 and 2019.", "Moreover, it does not change the previously approved costs of 4.53 billion in 2007 dollars, but rather it better matches the cost of the years' and what it is that expected to be incurred. The Commission has scheduled a hearing beginning November 4th to consider our request to approve the updated schedules for regulatory monitoring purposes. Under the Base Load Review Act the Commission must issue its decision of this request by January 20, 2010. We'll keep you updated as this process continues and we will continue to provide updated project milestones under the existing schedule in our quarterly SCANA's reports filed with the Office of Regulatory Staff.", "Our third quarter status report will be filed November, 16th and will provide an update of our capital cost incurred through September, 2009. A copy of the SCE&G report is available on our website at scana.com.", "Also according to E&I procedures on September, 30th the Commission approved our annual revised rate adjustment request for 22.5 million or 1.1% for the annual recovery of financing costs related to new CWIP. This requested rate adjustment was based on the incremental projects we'll uptake incurring from July, 2008 through June 30, 2009 and the updated project capital structure with the return on equity sit at 11%. These new rates will be effective on October 30th of this year. This represents the second increase under the Base Load Review Act.", "With regards to our new nuclear project, pre-construction activities continue on budget and on schedule. We have recently completed inspections related to the manufacturing of several key all new equipment items and are very encouraged by the quality and progress of the work. We are also continuing with additional site work and hiring and training of critical skilled workers.", "And finally, I am pleased to report the company personnel including our CEO, Bill Timmerman and Chief Nuclear Officer Steve Byrne recently completed our second trip this year to China to tour and inspect the Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear units already under construction. During this visit our delegation met with the Chairman of China's State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation as well as toured the module fabrication facility constructed in the Hainan site.", "As we said before, we believe the valuable insight gained from observing these ongoing construction sites will help us complete our projects more efficiently and approve our overall contraction process. In exchange for this access, we have agreed to train certain Chinese operations and maintenance personnel at our existing V.C. Summer unit. The first of these training sessions will begin in September 2010 is expected to last approximately 60 days. Steve Byrne will joining us on the call shortly to answer any questions you may have about his recent trip or any other nuclear related issues.", "Turning now to SCE&G's newly nuclear licensing process, on October 15th, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a news release addressing the Westinghouse AP1000 Design Certification Document 17 revisions related to shield building design issues associated with potential aircraft impacts, hurricanes and major storm events. This release provides an open and transparent look at the NRC review process. These issues are not new and have been under review for appropriate design modifications for several years.", "Discussions between Westinghouse and the NRC are ongoing and the NRC formal letter which outlines all of the NRC concerns on this issue gets all the technical issues on the table. Westinghouse is confident that they can satisfy the NRC concerns related to this matter. SCE&G anticipates that the NRC will adhere to their current published review schedule for DCD 17 with completion by August of 2011; although, Westinghouse is still hopeful to complete the process sooner. We do not believe this will impact our first unit commercial operation day in 2016 and we still expect to receive our COL in the second half of 2011.", "That concludes our prepared marks. Jimmy, Steve and I will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Chris Bassett with Decade Capital. Please proceed.", "Christopher Bassett - Decade Capital Management, LLC", "Good morning guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good morning.", "Christopher Bassett - Decade Capital Management, LLC", "Just had a question about the tax credit that realized this quarter; is that embedded in the newly updated 2009 earnings guidance?", "Jimmy Addison", "It is.", "Christopher Bassett - Decade Capital Management, LLC", "Okay, great. And on the SCANA Energy side of things, I understand you've lowered the ongoing sort of earnings there. So I think about that has been down a nickel and what were you guys expecting before hand?", "Jimmy Addison", "Its about or close or about $0.25 per share.", "Christopher Bassett - Decade Capital Management, LLC", "And can you provide some more color on sort of what happen there on the margin side?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah it's really, its not unique to SCANA Energy, it's the entire marketplace has really changed. And if you think that to post hurricanes Katrina and Rita and 12 to $15 natural gas prices with a majority of the market then on variable rates, a lot of folks had to pay some steep gas bills because of the cost of gas not the margins for that upcoming winner. And as gas prices have come down to fairly incredible lows recently more have elected to go with fixed rate plans. So for competitive reasons I am not going to give you our exact portfolio mix, but I will tell you that the market as a whole has moved from substantially variable to more of balanced portfolio between the two. Now when you've got the fixed rate plans, they're just not the repricing every month, there is not the volatility, et cetera and the margins were just naturally lower.", "Christopher Bassett - Decade Capital Management, LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michel Lapides. Please proceed.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, I a hand full of questions, I apologise for taking a little bit of time here. One, can you walk me through the various rate actions that will go into place either in the fourth quarter of 09 or during the course of 2010, so kind of items that have already been approved or items that you have filed for or will likely filed for? I am just trying to think about the master list of potential rate changes across your regulated stuff?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right. Well, Michael the first thing, each year you're familiar with the RSA at SCE&G's natural gas business. So that's each on each November 1st. And Kevin just discussed that a few minutes ago that will go into effect next week. Then we have the nuclear related increases so we've got the new rates that are filed each year that goes into effect each fall as well. So we've got those, we file those in May; they go into affect five months later.", "So basically end of this week those will be affected and we expect to stay on that annual schedule for the foreseeable future; we seen no reason to bury from that. The other increase -- of course in North Carolina we've got the usage track where there is a deferral of mechanism. So if there is a reduced consumption or an increased consumption per customer that is adjusted for every six months.", "So that means the electric business, non-nuclear, and we're at the point now where we're evaluating what we're going to do with that business; we've talked a great deal over the last few quarters about the $500 million of environmental expenditures we made to comply with federal law to support clean air. We do not have that yet in rates; we need to do that at some point very soon. And we expect to tell you more about within the next 90 days or certainly by our year-end earnings release in early February. So that's kind the lay  of the land from rate increase perspective; Kevin, anything else to add.", "Kevin Marsh", "I think that covers it.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Yeah, and Jimmy thank you and Kevin thank you. Can you on the RSA can you repeat the amount and can you just kind of walk me though the mechanics again, I just want to refresh my understanding?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, our RSA is filed early in the year and the adjustment we are going to have this time is $13 million that will be effective in bills starting in November. And as you recall the way that works is we have an established amount return of 10.25% and the Commission allows us to take the snapshot of that each March 31 and if we fall more than 50 basis points below, we file the necessary schedules to bring it back up to the old last amount which is exactly what we did this year. So you'll see $13 million on an annual basis and that was about a 2.5% increase in rates.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And Jimmy or Kevin, one other item, are there other -- are you contemplating filing at South Carolina Electric  Gas Utility gas utility rate case or also a  PSC&C rate case over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Kevin Marsh", "From SCE&G perspective the RSA is designed to take care of that on an annual basis. Unlike the electric side when you have large major components that go in with major plant construction; certain case what we are looking that now the scrubbers, the gas is more normal trend, regular increases so we can pick those up on a smooth basis year-to-year. And that is the annual adjustment to make the filing to recover those investments. It's not something outside of that unless it will something would be very unusual.", "Jimmy Addison", "And Michael as I also noted North Carolina with the increase that was there last fall we're earning near our allowed return in North Carolina. So I don't see one there within that 12 to 18 month time period unless something really radical changed in the marketplace.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Last item, I got pulled off the call for a second, so I want to make sure I understand. Can you revisit your comments regarding the nuclear CapEx schedule?", "Jimmy Addison", "We've provided those information in the filings that has gone before the Commission and fully updates, we've got all of the amounts that would show what we expect to spend. I think the important point there is to last schedule we filed with Commission, updated this shift about $400 million that we pushed out beyond the commercial operation dated 2011. So I am think the best source for that is pull that information from the website, we can give those details through Bryan Hatchell.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it, okay. Thanks guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay. Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question from the line of Chris Bassett with Decade Capital. Please proceed.", "Christopher Bassett - Decade Capital Management, LLC", "Hey just wanted a follow-up on rates on for 2010; do you have any comments on load next year and anything around sort of event rotations for economic recovery?", "Jimmy Addison", "Chris that is the question of the day anywhere I guess, but certainly here as well -- and all we can tell you at this point is that we've seen things really moving sideways the last couple of quarters. We have not seen it go down further, there are some possibilities of potential industrial announcements in and around our area that could be significant and we expect some of those within the next week or two specifically related to Boeing that's been out in the press a large potential 787 Dreamliner assembly line in Charleston, South Carolina in our territory, several hundred jobs maybe over 750. But, more broadly we just we really see things more flat from second quarter to third quarter as it relates to consumption.", "Christopher Bassett - Decade Capital Management, LLC", "And then also with regards 2010 on the pension side of things, any idea whether there are any incremental expense next year? I guess part of that, I missed it, with Michael questions, but any additional clarity on timing for recovery in rates of some the expenses in new plant and service?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. As it relates to pension you may or may not be familiar with the deferral order we have from the South Carolina Commission, it relates to both the electric and gas business in South California. But they have allowed us to defer the incremental cost as a result of the investment decline in South California -- investment in place now I am estimating here, maybe about 18 months. So we have not had any affect from the order and the regulated business in South California because of the reduction.", "During that period, we've also had a substantial recovery of the assets and we're now back at the point where we start off before the investments really declined a year ago; we had a about $1.30 in assets for every dollar in liability. So we were in very good shape as it relates to our pension assets related to the liabilities. We are now back above water, so I think the low point we got down it was in the 80% range, but we're now back with the assets exceeding the liabilities.", "So we feel good about where we are we are. We don't expect any incremental pension expense until we go in for a base rate proceeding at the time the Commission would take up to prior deferral and than I expect, what they would do what we will proposed is to take this deferred expense that is accumulated on the balance sheet in the end row, and select some amortization period of three years or so and spread that over it, or over at the time where we get additional revenue to offset that. So I don't see any incremental expense next year one way to answer your question.", "Christopher Bassett - Decade Capital Management, LLC", "Okay, thank you. And then finally on timing for new rates in effect would it be fair for me to assume the middle of next year?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, we got it basically a seven month window. We've got 30 day notice period and then six months from the date of the filing and typically what we do is give the 30 day notice, file the case 30 days later, six months from that date they are in effect. So all I am prepared to tell you today is that we will let you know more about that within the next 90 days. So you guys make your own assumption around that, I am sorry, can't be more specific.", "Christopher Bassett - Decade Capital Management, LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo", "Good morning, Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good morning.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo", "Could you over any impacts on weather this quarter and kind of  the impact on sales margin?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, weather was $0.02 positive compared to last year's third quarter and it was just slightly negative versus normal weather. So it was not a large driver for the quarter.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo", "Okay. All right, that's all I have. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Tim Winter with Gabelli. Please proceed.", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company", "Hi Jimmy just two quick questions. One is, do you know what the earned ROE is at the electric business at SCE&G for the trailing 12 months?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah Tim, just a second; I think we're about 935 -- 9.35.", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. And then, can you just update us on the interim financing plans for 2010, the program equity; what the dollar amount is?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. Tim, we don't have a great deal to do over the next 14 months or so. Really, it really ramps up more consistent with the nuclear CapEx in 2011 and afterwards. But to specifically answer your question, let me just finish up on 2009, here we got a small bond deal to do. In the past quarter, I think I suggested to you that would be in the 175 range with the cash we received from this tax resolution we now estimate that to be in the 150 range.", "So that's a little bit of incremental help for the balance of this year, but for the next 30 years as we expect to do 30 year deal. And then for next year our plan is to do equity in the 130 to 150 range. We have not been more specific about when we might do that; I want to tell you well repeat what I have said in the past which is the way the Base Load Review law is constructed. When you take that snapshot at the end of May when we make our annual filing, you adjust your, we re-measure your cap structure.", "So if you were going to do it in the middle of the year, it would make more sense to it before that filing than afterwards. If we don't need the equity to later in the year then it's a different issue. But generally in that 130 to 150 range next year. And of course that's incremental to the 80 to 90 million we expect to raise from our 401(k) and our dividend reinvestment plans.", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company", "And then one follow-up on that; when is the last day that you can get equity included in the rate filing; in another words would you need to issue equity before making a rate filing or that is included in the...?", "Jimmy Addison", "For the nuclear?", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company", "No, for the general rate case.", "Jimmy Addison", "Now you can reach out for any non-measurable increase up through really the hearing.", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins. Please proceed.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Good morning.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good morning.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "First I just have a follow-up on these rate increases to make sure I got the numbers right. I think you said you expect 13 million to go in effect next month for the RSA and then there is a 22.5 million from the DLI rates, so is that  35.5 million combined. Am I thinking about that right?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's right Dan.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. And on the BLRA one, and how much was the incremental quip incurred during the 12 months?", "Jimmy Addison", "Dan let me see if I have that; I don't even know, perhaps Byrne would maybe be able to provide that later. I really only have that kind of broken down annually during the life cycle of the plant, I don't have it broken down prior to the filing with the BLRA.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Over the next two years is the amount incurred over that period, somewhere like you expect over the coming periods -- kind of thinking about this without exceeding going forward, how does that, kind of play out?.", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I understand your question Dan. The best thing I can do is to refer you either to our side or to the PSC side to look at the expected, we've got the expected revenue increments laid out in our filings. So those would be the completely transparent for the life of the project what we expect to -- the future amount comparable to the 22.5 million laid out in our filings.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. So that's the website or...?", "Jimmy Addison", "It is. You can go to the scana.com under investor information, or PSC site, I believe. But Byrne can refer you to the specific side afterwards.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. That'll be great.", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay. I'll let him e-mail that.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay, that would be good. I was also wondering, do you have the nine months cash from operations for the nine months ending 930?", "Jimmy Addison", "Dan we always have that in draft form and really need to hold that confidential until we release that with our 10-Q filing likely next week.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. And I am just curious on the nuclear outage, is that going to be a normal outage and what's the timeframe that you expect the plant to be back available?", "Stephen Byrne", "This is Steve Byrne here, refueling outage at V.C. Summer is a standard type refueling outage. We do have a couple of large projects that are going to go on, but the duration is 43 days and we started on October the 15th, so some time in late November we should be back.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. I think that's all I have. Thanks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks Dan.", "Operator", "Our last question is the follow-up from the line is Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, I am trying to think about the impact of regulatory lag on BLRA revenue and cost recovery. I got appendix to of the -- I think over the second quarter BLRA updated showed that you are expecting to spent about $405 million on the project this year meaning in fiscal 09. The rate increase of $22.5 million doesn't necessarily, I think match up with what would be enough of a rate increase to enable you to earn your cost to capital, your pre-tax cost of capital on the $405 million? And maybe I am missing something; can you walk me trough just kind of walk me through it and whether there is lag impacting etcetera?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well Michael the only thing you're missing is AFC. If you look at the AFC earned during the nine months in the September 30th it's up $50 million over the comparable period of last year. And I would expect that to accelerate commensurate with the quip incurred during the period. So we're going to get the AFC when it is non-cash but that would be rolled into next year's BLRA filing and collected in cash revenue that year. And you'll probably remember because of that the overall capitalized interest on the plant projected at completion is around 4%. So it's really minimized because of the cash recovery.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it, okay. Thank you, guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah.", "Operator", "This concludes the question and answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jimmy Addison for closing comments.", "Jimmy Addison", "We appreciate the interest from all of you today and we had our another good solid quarter. We are looking to see the economy recovers so that we can give you more guidance for 2010 and we're pleased in our project stays on schedule here related to new nuclear.", "Thank you to all of you and have a great day.", "Operator", "This concludes our conference.

Thank you for standing by.  My name is Beth and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today.  At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call.  Everyone\u2019s lines have been placed on mute.  After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer period.  (Operator\u2019s instructions).  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, February 11, 2010.  Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line at this time.  I would now like to turn the call over to Betty Best, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.  ", "Betty Best", "Thanks, Beth.  I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference calls, including those who are joining us on the webcast.  For those of you following along on the web, there are accompanying slides we will refer to throughout the call today.  You can manually advance the slides or just print a hardcopy and follow along to each speakers voice prompt.  ", "Earlier today we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009.  In just a minute, Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G will review those results, give us dates on certain operational issues as well as our new nuclear program and respond to questions.  ", "Earnings press release and slide presentation that we will refer to in this conference call are available on our website at scana.com.  Beginning on Slide 2, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements that may be made during today\u2019s call, which are not statements as historical fact, are considered forward looking statement and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements.  Along those risks and uncertainties are those discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings.  The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward looking statements.  ", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Betty and good afternoon.  I would also like to welcome each of you to our call.  Continuing on to Slide 3, we reported 2009 full year earnings of $2.85 per share compared to $2.95 per share in 2008.  Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $0.62 per share, down from $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2008.  Our results were within our 2009 earnings guidance of $2.80-$2.95 per share, which had been narrowed from $2.65-$2.95 on our third quarter call.  ", "This quarterly and year over year decline in earnings was attributable to several factors as outlined on Slide 4.  First in our regulated electric operations, margins were down $0.09 per share for the year, and down $0.05 for the quarter.  That decrease was driven by continued weakened economy resulting in lower weather, normalized usage for our residential, commercial and industrial electric customers.", "This lower usage which collectively had an estimated earnings impact of $0.20 per share for the year offset the $0.03 per share favorable impact of customer growth, $0.05 per share impact from the BLRA increase and $0.10 per share from favorable weather.  Additionally, we realized an $0.08 decline in off system sales and transmission revenue largely due to the economy.", "The reduction in electric margins of $0.05 for the quarter looks disproportionate in relation to the $0.09 for the entire year.  But considering the $0.10 benefit of weather all incurred in the first three quarters, it\u2019s more comparable.  ", "We see the economic impact in Q4 is fairly consistent with the earlier trend.  We saw significant decline in our earnings at SCANA Energy for our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia.  For 2009 we reported earnings of $24 million or $0.20 per share compared to $33 million or $0.28 per share in 2008.  Consistent with the earlier quarters of 2009, this decline is largely a result of the shift in market places.  More customers opted for fixed rate pricing plans to lock in lower natural gas prices.", "This shift more than offset the positive gas margin impact from our North and South Carolina regulator businesses that were driven primarily by increased revenues and lower bad debt expenses.  ", "We continued our strong trend of cost control in Q4 and accumulated $0.18 per share in savings over 2008 and recognized $0.11 benefit from a state tax issue as reported in the third quarter.  However, this was not enough to offset the challenge of the economy and dilution.", "While both the fourth quarter and all of 2009 had been very challenging, we remained focused on our commitment to operational safety and reliability providing high quality customer service and delivering competitive returns to our shareholders in spite of a very weak economy.", "Slide 5 presents earnings per share by company.  For SCE&G 2009 earnings were down $0.05 per share due primarily to reduced electric margins from lower customer usage and dilution which more than offset lower O&M, the impact of the BLI increases and favorable weather. ", "PSNC showed solid earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2009 due primarily to continued customer growth, lower O&M and the November 2008 general rate increase.  ", "PGTC had another solid year with earnings of $0.08 per share.  We expect this business to generate similar earnings in 2010.  We\u2019ve already discussed SCANA Energy\u2019s $0.08 decline in earnings driven by customer switching to fixed rate plans.  For 2010 we expect this business to earn approximately $0.20-$0.22 per share, assuming normal weather.", "And finally, earnings at the other entities were essentially flat year over year.  ", "Please turn to Slide 6 and I\u2019ll take a minute to discuss the effectiveness of our expense control measures for 2009.  These efforts included holding non-labor O&M spending for 2009 to amounts below 2008 actual levels and reducing our number of outside contractors substantially to lower labor related costs.", "Additionally, 2009 saw a year of no salary increases for all exempt employees including management and very limited hiring.  As I stated earlier, these measures resulted in a year over year decrease of $0.18 per share compared to 2008.  ", "Given the ongoing economic uncertainty, we\u2019re targeting 2010 O&M expenses at the same overall run rate we saw in 2009.  There are a limited number of exceptions but we should be able to sustain the majority of the savings realized in 2009.  As we begin to see economic recovery, we will increase the necessary spending to support the increased growth.  As always, we will continue to do what is required to run our business as safely and reliably while providing exceptional service.", "Speaking of customers, as you can see on Slide 7, we continue to show positive growth in our regulatory and electric and gas service territories.  On the electric side, we added approximately 5,000 customers.  We added over 8,000 natural gas customers over the same period in our regulated businesses.  As we have said before, we expect this growth to return to more normal levels as we see signs of improvement in the economy.  ", "Slide 8 presents our preliminary three year Cap Ex forecast.  I stress, this is preliminary as we are constantly evaluating additional reductions based upon the economy.  Consistent with our quarterly BLRA filings, spending on our nuclear project is on track and is forecasted to remain relatively steady through 2011, with a substantial increase occurring in the 2012 time frame.", "On Slide 9, you see a summary of our near term financing plans.  On a consolidated basis, we issue approximately $480 million of new debt in 2009, including $150 million of junior subordinated notes that we used to call our then outstanding preferred stock.  We also raised approximately $186 million in equity through our 401K and dividend reinvestment plans in 2009.  And through a (inaudible) offering concurrent with being added to the (inaudible) 500 at the beginning of the year.", "As you can see for 2010 through \u201912 we are forecasting approximately $245 million in equity each year including that raised the existing plans.  This is an estimate for planning purposes and will be refined based upon actual cash needs and market conditions among other factors.", "Regarding our dividend announcement earlier today, I\u2019m pleased to report that our board of directors raised the indicated annual dividend rate to $1.90 per share, a 1.1% increase from the previous rate of $1.88.  The dividend is payable April 1 to share holders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2010.  Our board remains confident about the company\u2019s long term future despite the challenging economy and it important to relay that message to all of SCANA\u2019s shareholders with this increase.", "On Slide 10 you see our 1020 earnings guidance and assumptions necessary to achieve these results.  As we look forward to 2010 our focus continues to be very cautious and conservative in both operations and finance while maintaining our standards for customer service reliability and safety.  ", "In preparing our guidance for 2010 we considered the operating results of 2009, projected production of our largest industrial customers and known changes in property taxes, governmental fees and other major expense categories.  We are issuing preliminarily guidance for 2010 of $2.85-$3.05 per share.  This guidance assumes normal weather and our electric and natural gas service areas and effective tax rate of approximately 31%.", "We have also assumed reasonable regulatory relief from our pending electric rate proceeding which Kevin will be discussing further.  Of course, we will continue to monitor the economy and other developments as we move through the year gaining additional clarity on drivers, like customer growth, usage, market conditions, etcetera.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Kevin for our regulatory and operational update for SCE&G.", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Thanks, Jimmy and good afternoon.  I\u2019ll begin with a few operational highlights on Slide 11.  Our current performance at VC Summer Unit 1 continues to demonstrate why we chose nuclear power as our next increment of base low generation.  Our most recent operating cycle, which ended due to a schedule refueling outage in October was the most successful in VC Summer\u2019s history.  We set a continuous run record of 475 days, which means the plant was operating non stop 24 hours a day, seven days a week providing reliable emissions free power for well over a year.", "During this cycle we also surpassed 5.5 million continuous safe work hours demonstrating our commitment to safety.  ", "SCE&G Fossil Generation Fleet also continued to operate at a high level during 2009.  Our fourth outage rate was 1.42% which is our best performance in the past five years.  We were very pleased to once again have two plants listed on Electric Light and Power\u2019s top 20 plants in the nation based on their heat rates.  Which is a measure of how efficiently a generated uses heat energy.  Our McMeekin plant was ranked fourth and the Cope plant was ranked 12th.", "Finally we set a new winter peak of 4, 718 megawatts on January 11 of this year.  We are pleased we were able to serve this way with our existing generation fleet and did not need to purchase any power to meet this peak demand.  ", "Our very important environmental scrubber projects at Wateree and Williams stations are in their final stages.  We anticipate placing the Williams scrubber in service this month with the Wateree scrubber to be placed in service later this year.", "As a result, SO2 emissions at these two plants will be reduced by more than 95% and mercury emissions will be reduced by 60%-90%.  ", "Now turning to Slide 12, you see a summary of our most recent regulatory proceedings and their outcome at the top of the slide.  And the regulatory schedule for 2010 at the bottom of the page.  On the first two lines, please note the consistency of our BLRA approvals related to our new nuclear construction as this process is working as designed.  ", "Slide 13 details our most recent electric filing.  On January 15, we file an application with the public service commission of South Carolina requesting a 9.52% increase in retail electric base raise.  The requested increase, based on a 9.03% overall return on rate base and an 11.6% return on time and equity we\u2019ll produce an $198 million, and additional annual revenues based on an adjusted test year into September 30, 2009.  ", "This requested rate increase is driven primarily by the need to recover the cost of mandatory and environmental upgrades at the company\u2019s generating plant, including cost for the scrubbers at our Wateree and Williams plant.   It also includes the remaining unrecovered capital cost for the Lake Murray backup dam.  Expenditures for maintaining reliability of the electric transmission and distribution systems and other operating expense. ", "A public hearing on SCE&G\u2019s application is scheduled to begin May 24.  As with all regulatory proceedings, we anticipate working with interveners in an effort to reach a reasonable settlement.  Recognizing the financial challenges increased will represent for many of our customers in this economy, we\u2019ve asked the commission to phase in this inquiry in three stages over 18 months.  If approved, the first stage will generate approximately $66 million in annual revenues and will be effective on July 15, 2010.  Stage two would generate $64 million and be effective on January 1, 2011.  And stage three would be approximately $68 million in annual revenues, effective on July 1, 2011.", "Turning now to our new nuclear project update, beginning on Slide 14, I am pleased to report our pre construction work on VC Summer units 2 and 3 is proceeding in full compliance with the schedule approved by the commission.", "We\u2019ve made tremendous progress in our (inaudible) activities during 2009, including receiving a comprehensive free construction prudence review under the base low review act and approval for the siding of the two new plants.", "In addition, the commission recently approved an updated construction and capital call schedule for the construction of these units.  The updated construction schedule is site specific for our particular project and will replace the generic AP1000 Westinghouse construction.  Milestone schedule included in the initial 2008 base load review filings.", "It does not change the previously approved cost of $4.53 billion in 2007 dollars but rather better matches the cost to the years in which they are expected to be incurred.", "Detailed quarterly status reports on our nuclear project which includes supporting data from the informational Slide 14 is available on SCANA\u2019s website under investor relations.  Once there, click on the nuclear financial information link.", "We will be filing a new report with the commission on February 16, next Tuesday.  And I encourage you to review these filings each quarter.", "With regards to our combined operating license, or COL, application with the nuclear regulatory commission, discussions between Westinghouse and the NRC on the AP1000 design certification document revision 17, or DCD-17, (inaudible) issues are still ongoing.", "Westinghouse remains confident that they can (inaudible) the NRC concerns on this issue.  There will be a conforming DCD-18 submitted by Westinghouse this year which incorporates all of those spots to NRC questions and updates.  We still expect to receive our COL in late 2011 or early 2012 depending on the NRC review of DCD-18.  But we do not believe this will impact our first unit commercial operation date in 2016.", "I\u2019d like to give you a brief update on our department of energy loan guarantee application.  Today, SCE&G has filed both parts one and two of the application for a loan guarantee.  We are still awaiting a term sheet before determining our participation in this program.  Recent announcements by the DOE indicating their desire to speed up their process as well as comments by the administration regarding expansions of the program are encouraging.  As we have said all along, we are confident in our ability to finance this project without loan guarantee and we\u2019ll only participate if it\u2019s beneficial for our customers and shareholders.", "That concludes our prepared remarks.  And we\u2019ll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.  Thank you.", "Question and Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator\u2019s instructions)  We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.  Your first question comes from the line of Michel Lapides from Goldman Sachs.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Couple of questions on rate relief and some \u2013 I\u2019m really looking at Slide 12 here.  The $22.5 million granted and effective November 9th for the BLRA, how much of that got realized in fourth quarter \u201909 versus will show up in the first 10-11 months of 2010?", "Jimmy Addison", "Michael, I don\u2019t have that broken down, I\u2019m sorry.  But it\u2019s definitely cyclical with the winter months there.  It\u2019s not 2012, in other words.  But I just don\u2019t have the breakout, sorry.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  But the bulk of that is going to be the nuclear rate relief that you will have until the next one is implemented the following November?", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s exactly right.  And so you\u2019ll have the other 10 months of it will occur in 2010 and then another one will be filed this coming May that will be effective in November of 2010.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  On the gas side of SCE&G, when would you file \u2013 I know you just got the $13 million increase in November \u201909 of which you\u2019ll probably get the bulk of that in the fourth quarter \u201909 and first quarter \u201910 just due to the winter months.  But when would you likely file for rate relief again?  And is that forward looking or historical looking?", "Jimmy Addison", "Michael, it is historical looking and it is measured as of the end of the heating season, at March 31st each year.  And the dates will be consistent with the ones for \u201909.  So we\u2019ll file it in June and it will be effective in November.  Similarly we\u2019ll file the BLRA there in May and it\u2019ll be effective in November.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  And last item, and one of the guys on our team, Zack, will probably kill me if I didn\u2019t ask this.  But the reactor shield design review underway at the NRC, is there any update you can give about where that stands, what the next key steps to monitor are and what risks are still remaining or outstanding for companies like yours that are looking to build an AP1000?", "Kevin B. Marsh  ", "There has been a lot of activity relating to the shield.  (Inaudible) specifically focused on the interaction between the commission and Westinghouse.  They had asked them to do testing which they\u2019re in the process of doing.  That is close to being completed.  They\u2019ve got another round of tests after which they will be filing all those results with the commission for a final review (inaudible) testing for approval.  We except that\u2019ll take place in the next 45-60 days.  I can tell you we have had extensive discussions with Westinghouse on the shield building design.  And they are confident and positive that design will approved by the NRC.  It\u2019s just resulting in the final tests need to be done.  The tests that they have done to date, they have all been satisfactorily approved with additional safety margins.  And they\u2019re working very closely within to get those tests completed and all the information filed as quickly as possible.  But the key to us is that they are very confident the design will be approved.  At which time we can proceed with the application schedule.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Actually one final one.  You\u2019re keeping (inaudible) flat.  But your labor contracts probably what your (inaudible) employees probably have their normal up percent a year inflator.  Where are you getting the rest of the costs cut make up for that?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, as I said there may be some minor increases over \u201909.  But we\u2019re really trying to that level.  They are minor increases in labor, like 1.5%.  So it\u2019s not a substantial increase.  Yeah.  And that\u2019s just union and hourly employees.  No except employees or management are involved in that.  So it\u2019s not a significant number, as far as overall.", "Kevin B. Marsh", "In terms of the other cost cuts, I mean, that\u2019s an aggressive program we\u2019ve had underway since the fall of 2008 in closing out matters to find items that we could eliminate that reduce from the budget.  So even when you\u2019ve got someone that leaves the company, there\u2019s a hard examination done as to whether that position needs to be refilled at the time or it can be held for a period of time so you\u2019ve got significant savings in labor even though you\u2019ve got some increases are coming to play.  But generally those increases are across the board in every department of the company.  ", "I know Jimmy just completed an analysis.  And he showed the board earlier today it shows that virtually every group in the organization has found a way to reduce costs during this tight period.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  Thanks guys, much appreciated.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Shin Fakuta from Catecrop (ph).", "Shin Fakuta - Catecrop ", "Jimmy, I believe if I heard you correctly you said you\u2019re assuming a (inaudible) tax rate in your guidance for 2010, is that correct?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Shin Fakuta - Catecrop ", "What is the driver behind that?  It just seems a little low versus your historical levels.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah.  Principally (inaudible) non taxable portions of AFUDC.  And some other states investment tax credits that we\u2019re flowing through.  ", "Shin Fakuta - Catecrop ", "(Inaudible) benefits that we saw in the third quarter, we have a little more flow through in 2010 as well?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, that is really a catch up for several years.  And what we\u2019re feeling through perspectively on an annual basis is applying that same type credit for new investment and passing it through on an annual basis.  So that\u2019s a big driver.", "Shin Fakuta - Catecrop ", "Got it.  Okay.  And how should we look at the tax rate going forward then in 2011 beyond, if you can comment on that?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, I really don\u2019t have any thing as far as guidance beyond that period.  But at this point what we see, I think that\u2019s a safe number for the future.", "Shin Fakuta - Catecrop ", "Okay.  Great.  Thanks so much.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Good afternoon guys.  But what I was wondering was, you mentioned that we should take a look at the filing that\u2019s going to be happening on the 16th?", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Yes.  ", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Is there anything in particular that we should be expecting there?  I mean, do you think there\u2019s going to be \u2013 should we think that there might significant change in that?", "Jimmy Addison", "We didn\u2019t point that out because there\u2019s going to be any earth shatter news in there.  It\u2019s just that that contains all the information that we shared about the project.  As we said earlier we\u2019re trying to be as transparent as we can in exactly where we stand quarter to quarter.  And that has just a lot of narrative in terms of what\u2019s taken place at the project.  It\u2019ll tell you where we stand on all of the milestones that we report to on the commission and any other matters that we think are significant to be before the commission.  So really that was just to point out that that\u2019ll be a fresh report, it\u2019ll include all the updates.  I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any change in the industry this time, (inaudible) haven\u2019t had new ones come out.  That was done in the last report.  But it\u2019ll have the latest information based on everything we got going on related to that project.", "Kevin B. Marsh", "And Paul, it will incorporate the site specifics schedule for the milestones.  Where as before we were using the milestones for the generic schedule.  And the commission approved the new site specific schedule.  So you\u2019ll see how we compare versus all of those milestones.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay.  Great.  Really appreciate it.", "Operator", "(Operator\u2019s instructions)  Your next question will come from the line of Dan Jenkins from State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "First I just had clarification on your Slide 4 when you talked about the electric margin.  You broke it down, you said that the lower demand was a negative $0.20.  But I didn\u2019t get the other components.  I was wondering if you could repeat those.", "Jimmy Addison", "The lower demand was a negative $0.20.  We had about $0.03 favorable from customer growth.  The subsequent slide that showed additional customers.  And we had about $0.05 per share from the base load review act inquires.  That was effective in November of each year.  And then $0.10 per share, year over year for favorable weather.  2008 was very mild, 2009 was nearly normal.  In fact, we would say about $0.03 per share above normal, but $0.10 year over year.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay.  And on the demand, you mentioned a little bit that your not expecting a large increase.  I think you said going into 2010.  I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the industrial side about your (inaudible) kind of, as the quarter progressed and going into 2010 and then what you expect there?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, Dan, what we\u2019ve assumed and what we\u2019ve seen, first of all, historically is really just moving sideways.  We\u2019ve not seen substantial increase or reduction over the last couple quarters.  What we\u2019re assuming going forward is the same thing in this earnings guidance.  Now, outside of that, there are several announcements that have been made around the area for some pending industrial development.  I think I mentioned last quarter Boeing had just announced that they\u2019re going to make one of their assembly lines here for the 787 Dreamliner in our service territory.  And they expect the first plane to come off the line in the middle of \u201911.  So construction is well underway there now.  ", "There are several things that are much smaller than that that are being discussed.  But we just haven\u2019t it in the hard results yet.  And so we have not assumed that in our guidance.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay.  On your last picture you earnings release where you showed the quarterly volumes.  I was curious if there\u2019s about 18% increase in industrial natural gas (inaudible) and 21% increase in the transportation volume, what was driving that in quarter, do you think?", "Jimmy Addison", "Change in natural gas prices compared to a year ago.  Substantially lower prices, may get more competitive against other fuels and therefore usage was up.  In the industrial sector and those that buy their own gas and just pay a sub to transport it the same driver.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "What kind of uses were those then, chemical plants or \u2013", "Jimmy Addison", "I don\u2019t remember if it was concentrated it any segments.  But chemicals is our largest individual sectors.  Although none of our sectors are really dominant against the others.  So we\u2019ve got a pretty good mix across the territory.  But I would assume chemicals are in there.  But it\u2019s those that have alternative capabilities and they can move between different fuels.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "On Slide 8 where you talk about the Cap Ex, what was the final 2009 Cap Ex expenditures?", "Jimmy Addison", "Dan, I do not have that number in front of me.  But I believe we were under our original \u2013 the forecast that we had in (inaudible).  I think were in the ballpark of $50 million under our originally forecasted amount.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay.  ", "Jimmy Addison", "Again, just responding to the economy.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "And do you have what your 2009 cash flow from operations, what that number was?", "Jimmy Addison", "I do not have that to date.  That\u2019s still in progress.  We\u2019ll probably (inaudible) in a couple of weeks and we\u2019ll have it there. ", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay.  That\u2019s all I had.  Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator\u2019s instruction)  Your next question will come from the line of Tim Winter from Gabelli & Company.", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company", "Good afternoon, guys.  I had a couple of questions about the regulatory procedures upcoming.  First thought, do you have the earned ROE for South Carolina Electric and Gas for the 12 month period?", "Kevin B. Marsh", "I think I do have that.  Just a second, Tim.  I know it\u2019s going to be a quarter lag.  We don\u2019t have it completed for year end.  But for the electric company it was down around 7% once you consider the per forma adjustments and everything we included for filing in the rate proceeding.", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company", "Okay.  And then have you had any unusual reaction in the filing of this case?  From interveners or friends of the earth or anybody on the general rate case and how it\u2019s structured?", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Well, we\u2019re start by giving the size of the case.  If you recall the past two or three cases we have filed have probably been in that 3%-7% range, if my memory serves me right.  And the 9.5% is a larger number than we typically file for it in our regular rate cases.  The fact that it\u2019s been driven by the mandatory expenditures on the environment abatement program allowed more people to understand that, certainly it\u2019s a tough time to be filing a rate case in South Carolina but the employment in challenges in our state and others have.  So certainly initially when we filed the case there was a lot of push back, a lot of people trying to understand what was driving it.  We have had a lot of information go out meeting with all the folks that are helping us deliver the messages to what\u2019s driving it.  And if you look at that case and you look at the impact, it\u2019s coming from the government mandate on the environmental equipment.  The remaining expended (inaudible). And I think it\u2019s about $17 million increase in property taxes that makes up almost 2/3 of the case as filed.  So certainly that\u2019s driving the larger numbers.", "The O&M we filed in this case was less than what we filed in our last case.  Based on our cost control efforts.  And that\u2019s certainly something we extend to emphasize in the hearing.  Because that\u2019s a big message for us.  I think shows the effort our team has put forward to hold that cost.  We\u2019ve had some additional maintenance that we\u2019re going to have to spend on our power plants because they\u2019re older plants to keep them reliable.  And about $7 million in additional tree trimming.  All of which goes to help reliabilities.  So when you add up the government mandates, the system reliability and what we\u2019re spending on customer growth and we had already spent on customer growth before the system, slowed down due to the economy, and that makes up almost 90% of the request.  So our goal was to then communicate that information, have people understand what\u2019s driving it.  The fact that we waited a year to file this case, and they going to ask us last year several time when were we going to file to try to recover the dollar for scrubbers.  And we postponed it last year.  And even in this filing this year, simply pushed it out 18 months I think shows we\u2019re doing everything we can to minimize the impact.  But the reality is we\u2019ve got dollars invested, over $700 million of these expenditures that we simple got to recovery and find the easiest way to make that happen.  ", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Gavin Pam from Macquarie.", "Gavin Pam \u2013 Macquarie ", "Just a question on the decline at Georgia.  I understand that more customers are opting for fixed rate plans.  But is the decrease in income related to, I guess, the cost of natural gas, the lower margins?  I guess I would have through that you would hedge those fixed rate customers to lock in your margins.  So could you give us a bit more color on whether we should expect earnings improvement beyond 2010?  Thanks.", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Yeah.  Let me start with your last comment here first.  We really feel like it\u2019s a, kind of, $0.20-$0.22 a share business for the foreseeable future.  So we think that \u2013 and I think this year was $0.21.  We see it right in that range prospectively.  We\u2019re $0.20 this year.  So we really don\u2019t see a lot of volatility in it going forward.  We think the markets made the move.  But it\u2019s really not driven so much by the pricing of natural gas.  It\u2019s drive more by just the competitiveness of the market that has gotten the margins down to the level that they are on the variable side.  ", "Now on the fixed side you\u2019re exactly right.  We do hedge those completely.  So each month when we offer a fixed rate program, for example, in this month of February for all of those that opt for a 12 month fixed rate plan, we will aggregate those customers and put a financial hedge behind it.  So that our risk is eliminated and we know what those margins are during the term of the contract.  So it\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t hedge it.  It\u2019s not that we\u2019re loosing it because of volatility and the price of gas.  It\u2019s the fundamental shift that the market itself as a whole is offering lower net margins on fixed contracts than there are on variable contracts.  And we\u2019re simply a part of that market.", "So hopefully that kind of helps explain your question.", "Gavin Pam \u2013 Macquarie ", "Okay.  It does.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Your net question will come from the line of Chris Ellinghaus of Wellington Shield.", "Chris Ellinghaus Wellington Shield", "Hey, guys.  How are you?  A couple of clarifications, or if you can add any details to this in the fourth quarter weather didn't seem to be particularly poor for you, but can you add any color to where the declines, particularly in residential and commercial came on the electric side?", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Yeah, Chris.  You're right.  Weather was normal statistically and comparable to 2008 so both year's fourth quarters were \"normal.\"  Really the declines in consumption were fairly consistent with the first three quarters, it's just quarters one through three in 2009 we had normal weather or slightly above normal where we did not in 2008 so that weather masked some of the residential and commercial consumption decline in the first three quarters, but we really did not see it different in the fourth quarter than we did in the first three.", "Chris Ellinghaus Wellington Shield", "You're not seeing any positive trend at all in customer usages as the economy \"gets better?\"", "Kevin B. Marsh", "We've not seen it yet.  We're hopeful.  As I said, we hear a pending industrial development, but we've not seen it yet.  And we really think it's all driven by the industrial sector as more jobs are created and more industrial expansions occur they'll create jobs that create more confidence, and frankly income, with the residential and commercial.", "Chris Ellinghaus Wellington Shield", "Okay.  And that just leads me to my next question is can you give us a little color on the Boeing plant and when you're expecting them to ramp, not necessarily for the first plant, but when are they going to start production, and what kind of benefits you are expecting there?", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Yeah.  Last thing I saw was middle of 2011 for the production to really get going and I don't think the impact for us is substantial on our margins, but it is least not directly.  But the jobs that it will create, the thousands of jobs, back to the earlier discussion we had and the income and the households will help a substantial amount.", "Chris Ellinghaus Wellington Shield", "Right.  You're expecting a decent amount of household formation out of the Boeing plant?", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Well, formation o r further saturation of existing houses.", "Chris Ellinghaus Wellington Shield", "All right, thanks a  lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow from the line of Michel Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, guys.  When I look at your CapEx schedule on nuclear, as well as your equity financing needs over the next couple of years, and think about the fact that you don't get the rate increases until November, a little surprised that you've maintained kind of when you look out to 2012, an equity issuance level that looks pretty similar to 2010-2011 given how big of a step up in nuclear CapEx you will occur in 2012.  And it's not expensive regulatory lag, but given the fact there is a tiny bit of lag measured in months, not years of regulatory lag, just curious about what you're trying to keep the corporate holding company balance sheet level and whether you're planning on issuing debt at the hold co and down streaming that as equity into SCE&G?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, Michael.  We do not plan to issue anything at the hold co to downstream to SCE&G so I'll start there.  And really if you look back at the three year period you'll see that there's no debt to be issued in this plan for 2010.  Last time we spoke I think we were still talking about maybe $150-$200 million of debt to be done in 2010 and we've got that off the table now.  With the CapEx reductions we don't need that so adding this equity in, in 2010 that we will downstream to the utility, will help strengthen the balance sheet and so you really see a disproportionate investment in equity there compared to that 50-50 strategy.  And if you consider that over three year period, maybe we're getting a little head start on that, as well as if you consider that the internally generated funds through the BLRA and the existing business will help contribute towards it.  That's how we're really building that.  So it is difficult to just take it and look at it in just one year and expect to see 50-50.  We really look at it over the long term.", "Michel Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Reza Hatefi of Decade Capital.", "Chris Bassett - Decade Capital", "Hello.  It's actually Chris Bassett.  Just was wondering what's happening to depreciation at SCE&G year over year.  I know there's a lot of moving parts there with this coverage coming on line, and then some of the requests in the rebate case?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, Chris.  First of all, as part of the filing of this rate case we've updated our depreciation study which we do periodically about every five years, and actually, our depreciation rates are going down a small amount.  So we're encouraged by that and basically that's because the actual lies as the engineer reviewed it are longer on many of the assets than we had earlier estimated.  So we're bringing that benefit in through the rate filing and I think that number is in the $10-$15 million per year on average.  In addition to that I think I might just turn it over to Kevin in a minute for kind of his strategy for how he's looking to manage CapEx during the economy here.", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Yeah.  We've paid a lot of attention to what the rate impacts will be going forward and just looking at your base regulatory model.  If you're going to earn a return on your rate base then theoretically you can increase that rate base by the amount of your annual depreciation with new capital expenditures and not have to adjust rates for that. So we've taken that and gone back and taken a hard look at our capital budget and tried to make some adjustments to that as we go through 2010.  Our annual run rate on depreciation expense now is between, I think it's $260-$270 million and that number won't change because that property has already been put into service and that depreciation will continue so it's a matter of how well can we control those capital expenditures in terms of how much we will add to that number on annual basis, but that fits right into our strategy of trying to manage the capital especially as we're in this tough economic period and do the best we can to hold that down.", "Jimmy Addison", "And Chris, of course the number Kevin was giving you is at SCE&G and in addition there's about 50 million in aggregate and the other company's annual.", "Chris Bassett - Decade Capital", "Sure.  So still, would it be fair to assume G&A is flat year over year at SCE&G as a result of the new depreciation rates?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, you'll see additional depreciation related to the scrubbers and all the capital would be considered in this rate case.  All of that has gone into service at the end of 2009 early 2010 you'll see new depreciation for that and I don't have that exact number.  Once we get the 10-K filed we can probably break that down and give you a little more detail on it.", "Chris Bassett - Decade Capital", "Okay. And then finally, can you quantity the benefit?  And I understand it will be ongoing from the tax credit that you're going to be using going forward at SC&G", "Jimmy Addison", "Chris, I don't have the number here in front of me, but my recollection is that the state investment tax credit, I believe, is limited to $5 million per year for that particular credit and there's a couple of other smaller credits too, but I'm fairly confident that's the limit per year, and of course you can carry forward if you max over that which is what drove the entire spring court case that we were awarded here last quarter.", "Chris Bassett - Decade Capital", "Okay great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) Your next question is a followup from the line of Dan Jenkins from State of Wisconsin Investments.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Hi.  I had a followup related to the financing plan.  I know you mentioned that you don't really have any debt financing plans for 2010, but your balance sheet showed you have $335 million of short-term borrowing at the end of the year.  I guess is it your strategy to continue to use that short-term borrowing and not turn that out?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah.  Well, part of it is, is working capital will help offset some of that as we work through the heating season and come out of the winter months so that's driving some of it as paying for the commodity in advance, namely natural gas, as we move through this heating season.", "The other thing, Dan, is that if you'll notice on that charge on Page 9, there is $100 million there that's noticed at PS&C.  We actually arranged that financing last year and it has a delayed draw feature so we will draw that down and that is long-term termed out money so we will have that completed here probably in the first quarter and we'll essentially convert that from short term to long term so I think you will see that come down.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay.  And then you mentioned on that page that you're looking to renew the credit facilities in 2010 and given the size of the nuclear CapEx program do you anticipate that being the same size or will you need to upsize that credit facility and then what's the timing?  Is that like second half of 2010?", "Jimmy Addison", "It is the second half of 2010.  We would like to have it in place by the end of the year, but are not anxious to move into it much faster than that because there's certainly going to be additional cost associated with that facility, even undrawn costs that are not there today.  So we would like to have it in place at least a year before the expiration date, but we'd like to get it in the latter part of the year.", "As to the size, we're really undertaking that now.  We're actively involved in evaluating that both internally and with our supporting banks and we just haven't come to a decision on that yet.  There may well be reallocations within that facility because it's really broken into four different components for the different subsidiaries, and while we've termed out some of PS&Cs, we could end up at a level, but move more of it to SCE&G to support the nuclear construction.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the queue.  I would now like to turn our call back over to Mr. Jimmy Addison for closing comments.", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, thanks.  In closing, I would just say that 2009 was a very challenging year for us in many respects and while we continue to manage through this difficult time and work towards our 2010 and long-term goals, we're confident that as we come out of this economy as it recovers that we're strategically positioned within our sector to emerge as a leader and bring value to the shareholders.", "We appreciate your time today and welcome your followup questions to our investor relations group.

Thank you for standing by. My name is Kwanda and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, May 6th, 2010. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.", "Byron Hinson", "Thanks. I'd like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. For those of you following on the web, there are accompanying slides we'll refer to throughout the call today. You can manually advance the slides, or you can print a hard copy and print along with each speaker's prompts.", "Early today we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2010. In just a moment, Jimmy Addison, Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G will review those results and respond to questions. The earnings press release that we will refer to in this conference call is available on our website at SCANA.com.", "Beginning on slide two, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements that may be made during today's call, which are not statements of historical fact, are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, Including the risks and uncertainties discussed in the company's SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Byron. I would like to start on slide three, which reflects SCANA's first quarter earnings on a GAAP basis of $1.02 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the first quarter of 2009.", "These results were driven by several positive factors, including higher consumption due to weather and other factors, increased revenues associated with the Base Load Review Act and Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act and customer growth on our system. These factors more than offset the negative impact of higher operating and maintenance expenses, incremental interest expense, increased property tax and share dilution.", "During this recession, we've been very diligent with our cost control. The majority of the $13 million increase in O&M expense is due to recorded bad debt expense related to substantially increased sales and some increase in incentive compensation accruals due in part to the recent performance of our sock.", "O&M, net of these two components, is only up about $6 million or $0.03 per share. Principal factors for this increase are outage costs at our Jasper plant, the performance of more tree trimming earlier in the year and growth in labor at PSNC to support new customer adds.", "As shown in the graph on slide four, kilowatt hour sales of electricity to our retail customers in 2010 were up 10% over 2009. Residential sales increased 18.6%. Commercial sales were up 3.4% and industrial sales rose 6.9%. Overall, total kilowatt hour sales of electricity, which includes sales to other utilities were up just under 9%. We estimate sales exclusive of weather were up approximately 3.7%. We're encouraged by these results.", "Consolidated therm sales of natural gas in 2010 were up 11.9%. Residential sales increased 24.6%, commercial sales rose 11.8% and industrial sales were up 3.8%. Additionally, this quarter we deferred for potential refund $25 million of estimated incremental electric revenues earned during the quarter due to the unusually cold weather.", "This deferral is part of a proposed pilot weather normalization or WNA mechanism we made to the office of regulatory staff or ROS in rate case settlement negotiations. Kevin Marsh will talk more about the rate case including this provision in a few minutes.", "Now, I'd like to review first quarter results for our principal lines of business on slide five. As you know, the majority of SCANA's operations are regulated. Our regulated utility businesses, South Carolina Electric & Gas, PSNC Energy and Carolina Gas Transmission collectively represent more than 90% of the company's total assets and annual earnings per share.", "SCE&G, our largest subsidiary reported earnings of $0.51 per share, unchanged compared to the same quarter last year. These results are net of the $25 million WNA revenue deferral previously discussed and are attributable to higher non-weather related consumption, customer growth and the impact of increases in rates under the base load review act and the national gas rates stabilization act. These increases were offset by higher O&M and interest expenses and share dilution.", "On slide six, as of March 31 of this year, SCE&G was serving approximately 659,000 electric customers, which represents a 1.1% increase during the year. Over the same period, SCE&G's natural gas customer base increased 1.2% to approximately 313,000. PSNC Energy, our retail natural gas distribution company in North Carolina, reported earnings for the first quarter of $0.25 per share, unchanged compared to the same quarter in 2009.", "These results are due primarily to improved margins, offset by slightly higher operating expenses and depreciation. At March 31, 2010 PSNC Energy was serving approximately 475,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 1.3% over the last 12 months. We're very encouraged to see improving customer growth in our system and increased non-weather related consumption.", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported earnings of $0.24 per share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $0.18 per share in the comparable period of 2009. This improvement is due primarily to unusually cold weather, which drove higher volumes and resulted in improved margins.", "At March 31, 2010 SCANA Energy was serving approximately 465,000 customers in Georgia, maintaining its position as the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company reported earnings of $2 million or $0.02 per share compared to breakeven results in the first quarter of 2009. This improvement is due primarily to a lower effective tax rate.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin for a regulatory update on SCE&G.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks, Jimmy and good afternoon. Before I discuss the rate case, I would like to take a minute to address a few other regulatory items at SCE&G and we'll start on slide seven.", "On May 17th, we will file our quarterly status report with the PSC and office of regulatory staff, as required under our recent base load review order associated with our new nuclear activities. This report will provide a detailed update of our capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and will be available on our website.", "As information, the updated project costs, through December 31st, 2009 is outlined on slide eight. As you can see, the only changes between the approved costs and our latest estimate relate to the fluctuations in projected escalation.", "On May 28th, we also expect to submit our annual revised rate adjustment filing with the PSC for the annual recover of financing costs related to CWIP. The requested rate adjustment will be based on the incremental CWIP incurred, since the June 2009 filing and an updated capital structure. The ROE is set at 11%. New rates under this filing will go into effect October 30th of this year after a review by the ORS and approval by the PSC.", "On a related note, I am pleased to report that the South Carolina Supreme Court in a 5/0 decision has affirmed the base load review order issued by the PSC and the appeal initiated by Friends of the Earth. In upholding the PSC decision, the court ruled that SCE&G's application, as well as the PSC's thorough and well reasoned order adequately addressed all of the concerns raised by Friends of the Earth.", "There is one additional base load review appeal regarding the appropriateness of contingency costs, pending before the South Carolina Supreme Court. While we were unsure of the timing of a final decision, we are confident in our position in that case as well and we'll update you once we have an outcome.", "Turning now to our 2010 retail electric rate case. All of our direct testimony, along with testimony from interveners has been filed and settlement discussions are ongoing. On Monday, SCE&G signed a stipulation with the Office of the Regulatory Staff that would lower SCE&G's proposed 9.52% requested increase to 6.55% and provide a $25 million weather related credit to its electric customers.", "This stipulation is subject to approval by the PSC, which is scheduled to begin a public hearing on the rate request May 24th. The key stipulations include a 10.7% return on equity and the introduction of a 12-month pilot weather normalization adjustment mechanism or WNA to SCE&G's billing structure for electric rates.", "Once implemented, the pilot WNA program would result in adjustments to customers monthly electric bills to reflect normal weather. Similar to a mechanism SCE&G applies to natural gas bills, this program would reduce the occurrence of large monthly swings on electric bills resulting from extreme winter or summer weather.", "Under the program, forecasts with normal temperatures would be based on a 15 year average. We are pleased to have entered into a stipulation with the ORS on these key items and we'll continue to work over the next few weeks with ORS and other interested interveners to address remaining issues. You can see a full schedule for the rate case on slide nine of the presentation. We will be sure to keep you informed if there are any additional announcements related to this case.", "I'll now turn the call back over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Kevin. As you can see on slide ten, despite the $25 million revenue deferral previously discussed, we still had strong first quarter results, primarily due to our Georgia operations and we're reaffirming our 2010 earnings guidance of $2.85 to $3.05 per share.", "Additionally, we continue to target the long-term average annual earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%. Keep in mind, our guidance assumes reasonable outcome to the pending retail electric rate case, normal weather in our SCANA Energy Georgia natural gas service areas for the year and our electric service until and if the WNA is implemented and excludes any potential impact from changes in accounting principles and certain gains or losses from investing activities, litigation and sales of assets. Other factors that may impact future earnings are discussed in our SEC filings.", "And finally, I'd like to thank everyone who participated in our Analyst Day event at V. C Summer on April 8th. We had a tremendous response with over 100 analysts participating either in person or via the web. A replay of the webcast, the detailed presentations and a transcript of the event are available at SCANA.com.", "If you've not had a chance to review this material, I would strongly encourage you to do so, as we provided a detailed update on our new nuclear strategy and preconstruction process, as well as recent and upcoming regulatory activities. Speakers included SCANA management, the CEO of Westinghouse and our Shaw Project Manager.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed, sir.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good afternoon.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "First, I was just wondering, on the rate case stipulation, if you could \u2013 does that basically settle all the issues between the company and the staff or are there still some other open issues?", "Jimmy Addison", "Dan, that really only addresses three points, it addresses \u2013 and it's between obviously the company and the ORS, there are other interveners in the case as well, but it addresses the return on equity at 10.7%, same level our rates are set at today. It addresses a WNA pilot mechanism prospectively and it addresses a $25 million refund for the weather-related earnings in Q1.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. So just taking those into account takes your rate increase request down to 6.55?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's right.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Does the staff have further adjustments in to that?", "Jimmy Addison", "They do the staff has filed their testimony earlier this week, on Monday evening and it's all available publicly on their website and they do have other adjustments that they've proposed. Generally, if you look at all of their adjustments, they would take the overall increase down to about 51% of our original ask, so about 4.8% to 4.9% overall increase.", "And there would be amortization of the weather for the first year and of some tax credits we have over a two-year period. So it would step in over three years, but our revenues would be at the 51% level from day one. It's just the customers' impact would be substantially less year one and year two. But all of that is available publicly on their website and I presume on the PSC's website as well.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "So related to the three-phase increase, how is it being proposed if, say, it goes down from 9.5 to 6.5, or to 4.5, or wherever it ends up, would the three phases be equally adjusted, or would you get more in phase 1 and then just less in phases 2 or 3?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, what I've just described is the staff's recommendation, and the staff's recommendation is for a single increase. There would just a be, if you will, a rate rider that would be a detriment for years one and years two for those two items, to phase in the weather for the first year and to phase in the tax credits for two years. So from the customer's perspective, they would see, based on the staff's recommendation, about 26% of our original request year one, about 39% year two and then ultimately 51% year three, based on, again, staff's recommendation But of course as we would be amortizing back the weather deferral and the tax credits, we would be advertising those back into income to get back to the total 51% from day one.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then related to the pilot mechanism for, you know, weather adjusted weather normalized, that would just impact the additional volumes related to base rates, right? The fuel clause would still flow through as it incurred? Is that correct?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, that's correct.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "And I was wondering, the last thing I have, if you could kind of update us on what you're seeing related to the industrial customer demand and your service territory?", "Jimmy Addison", "It's been encouraging and fairly consistent with the releases of our neighbors over the last few days. Overall, industrials were up about 7%. Some of our larger \u2013 the larger industrials were up more than that but overall the category was up about 7% and I would say 75%, 80% plus of the customers each \u2013 of each \u2013 of the customers as a whole were up. So 7 to 8 out of 10 used more, and on average, about 7% more.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "How about by sector?", "Jimmy Addison", "Really, don't have a sector analysis with me, but we don't have any huge concentration in any one sector. I think our largest sector is related to chemicals, and related, and that's in the teens, maybe 15% or so. So we don't have any huge skewing to any one sector. Most of the others are single digits, 7% to 8% of the overall industrials.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed, sir.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey, guys, can you just provide an update, I know you did at your analyst day, regarding some of the milestones for the nuclear development and Westinghouse's next steps regarding the shield design?", "Jimmy Addison", "Michael, I have Steve Byrne with me. I'm going to let Steve respond to that.", "Steve Byrne", "Good afternoon, Michael. The next steps for Westinghouse, they turned into the nuclear regulatory commission in March, the first phase of a detailed designer port for the new shield building design. They are scheduled to turn in the second and final phase of that tomorrow, May the 7th, and, at the same time, the testing program that they're doing at Purdue University is continuing. All of the tests there so far on the new design have passed with significant margin and so those test results will be submitted to the NRC sometime in June, just as a confirmatory test but the information they need on the shield building will have been provided in the March submittal and tomorrow's submittal. So after tomorrow they should have everything they need. We would anticipate also that after the NRC has had some time to digest the submittal from tomorrow, they will be issuing a new schedule for the DCD review. And we anticipate that sometime in late May or early June.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it some I went back and looked at ORS' review of your fourth quarterly filing on the BLRA and it's the first time, they expressed what I think sounds like a pretty big level of concern regarding the timeline being tied to this. Just curious for any feedback and how any potential delays would be dealt with at the ORS and the PSC level?", "Steve Byrne", "Well, first of all, we don't see that the \u2013 that the current timeline, unless \u2013 unless there are any significant changes to it, will impact our in-service states for the unit. So we're looking at the in service states in 2016 and 2019 as being unaffected. Relative to what we would have to do under BLRA, we have some margin both on costs and on schedule. And we anticipate now that all of our milestones will still come in within that margin on cost and on schedule.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Hi, how are you doing?", "Jimmy Addison", "Good, Paul.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Really pretty much everything has been asked and answered, but just on the economy, just what's your \u2013 what's your sense? I mean you mentioned the industrial sales, which looked pretty good and you said the sense is that sort of a restocking or what have you or what is your outlook, I guess, in your crystal ball?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, we certainly don't have a crystal ball but I think there was some restocking going on. I mean, we've seen here, just like we've seen around the country and the world, where there was a drain of inventories in the second half of \u201809, but there has to be replenishment now. But we've seen a lot of industrial announcements, too. I think we've talked at our year-end release about Boeing's announcement to locate the 787 Dreamliner second assembly line here in our territory in Charleston. Just this week, they announced that they have selected South Carolina to locate the plant that will manufacture all the interior parts for that aircraft. The parts you and I would see as we go inside the aircraft. So that's another encouraging sign.", "And there's, I don't know, half a dozen other announcements like that in the industrial area of, 100, 200, 300 jobs around the territory and in other areas outside of our territory in the state. So that's encouraging. The other think I would point to is, is in our core retail customer growth, we added about 4200 electric customers in the first quarter and that's more than we added in the first quarter of \u201809, more than we added in the first quarter of \u201808. You have to go back to the first quarter of \u201807 to find a quarter that exceeded that number of adds.", "Same thing on the gas business in South Carolina, they added 2,900 customers in the first quarter, more than either of the first quarters of the last two years and very close to Q1 of \u201807. At North Carolina, where the growth has remained a little higher, it has not bounced back quite as quick, but it's still higher in a raw percentage and we added more than we did in \u201809, not as strong as \u2018 08. So, you know, we see it in core retail, we see it in the industrials, so we're fairly encouraged. Obviously, a quarter doesn't make a trend, but it's certainly better than the last half dozen quarters.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Good afternoon, gentlemen. Do you have weather adjusted sales data available?", "Jimmy Addison", "Jonathan, what we got is an overall aggregate of \u2013 we estimate about 3.5 to 4% increase in sales if you remove the effect of weather in the electric business. Now, the only caution I would offer with that is that is always some art involved in that. It's not completely mathematical. We have regression models that we base it on, but it's difficult to estimate. When you have a quarters that has as much extreme weather as this quarter had, it makes it difficult to estimate as well. But it looks to us like 3.5% to 4% non-weather related consumption growth and you couple that with the growth of number of customers attached to the system and that's encouraging.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Sure. You didn't happen to have it, too, by like residential and commercial and particular commercial. Was that \u2013 was it still negative on the commercial side if you strip out the weather?", "Jimmy Addison", "No. It was positive.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. What about residential? Do you have, you know, rough ballpark?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, I don't have the breakdown, but do I know they were positive.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. And then second question, just how should we think about, I guess, SCANA Energy and the weather sensitivity there? Obviously, first quarter came in above, you know, what you're even talking about for full-year contribution. You know, is that just pretty abnormal, you were, purely weather, anything happen, as far as the underlying margin expectations of the business?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, it was weather. It was about $0.06 ahead of last year and I would say that's a reasonable benchmark to compare it to what we would expect for the \u2013 if we had a normal remaining three quarters, I would expect it to earn $0.05 to $0.07 more than we had originally forecasted just due to weather in Q1.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. And then as far as just weather sensitivity going forward, I mean is this business generally that sensitive or is it just when it's really extreme?", "Jimmy Addison", "No. I mean, it is sensitive for sure, but this is an incredibly extreme quarter. I mean, this is the most extreme winter quarter any of us remember and the data supports that, too. So this is a really unusual quarter. Now, the business, your comment earlier about it being earned more than the whole year forecast of $0.20 to $0.22, I think is where we guided you originally. Of course, it's a cyclical business. So in these gas businesses, in the summer months, you're actually going to have a small cyclical loss.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Right. Okay. I appreciate the additional information, and congrats on a good quarter.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Jonathan.", "Operator", "And with no further questions in the queue, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jimmy Addison for closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you very much. We appreciate all of your interest today. In summary, we're off to a positive start in 2010. We're very pleased to see some signs of economic recovery beginning to materialize in our territories and I'm confident for our prospects for a solid year.

My name is Ann and I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator instructions)", "As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, July 29, 2010. Anyone who does not consent the taping may drop off the line at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron Hinson", "Thanks, Ann; and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast.", "As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the second quarter of 2010. In a moment, Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G will review those results and respond to questions. The earnings press release that we will refer to in this call is available at SCANA.com.", "As a reminder, certain statements that may be made during today's call, which are not statements of historical fact, are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could show and reflect to and as discussed in the company's SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Byron; and good afternoon. I would also like to welcome each of few to our call. Let us start on slide three, which reflects SCANA's second quarter earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.45 per share in 2009. This $0.02 decline was due primarily to the impact of higher property factors, interest, slightly higher O&M expenses, and sheer dilution, which more than offset improved electric margins driven by favorable weather, customer growth, and electric base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act.", "Additionally, second quarter earnings were negatively impacted $0.03 from income taxes due to a change in income tax accounting for capital maintenance. The change in accounting affects certain types of costs previously accreted as property additions and deducted through depreciation, which will instead be treated as current expenses for income tax purposes. This change is expected to eliminate taxable income on our 2009 income tax returns, and as a result, is expected to provide approximately $100 million of cash benefit, primarily to be realized over the next year, as our 2010 estimated income tax payments are reduced. The only downside is that the elimination of taxable income will result in the loss of an unrelated deduction, hence the $0.03 one-time charge in Q2. This improved cash flow from the deferral of taxes will be used to mitigate external capital requirements. Initially, it may allow us to defer the planned takedowns under our equity-forward transaction to help minimize dilution, but ultimately, we expect to further strengthen the balance sheet by reducing planned debt issuances.", "Earnings for the first six months of 2010 were $1.45 per share compared to $1.39 per share in 2009. This $0.06 per share year-to-date increase in earnings is due to improved first-quarter earnings in our non-regulated retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, and customer growth in our regulated businesses, which resulted in improved electric and natural gas margins, more than offsetting higher O&M and interest expenses, property and income taxes, and dilution.", "Although quarterly earnings were down slightly compared to last year, they would have been up if not for the elective change in taxes and we are pleased to see continued signs of economic recovery in our service territory. As shown on slide four, kilowatt hour sales of electricity to our retail customers in the second quarter of 2010 were up 7.3% compared to the same quarter in 2009, with all classes showing nice increases, while industrials rose an impressive 14.8%. Overall, total kilowatt hour sales of electricity, which includes sales to other utilities, were up 5.3%. Of course, weather contributed to the residential and commercial increase, with core growth and the industrial improvement providing the balance.", "On slide five, consolidated therm sales were down 1.1%, driven by lower residential, commercial, and sales for resale. We may recall, we had a cold April last year, which resulted in higher volumes compared to this year's very warm second quarter. This weather-driven decline more than offset strong industrial sales, which are up 3.9% compared to last year. We are very encouraged by these quarterly and year-to-date sales results, and are cautiously optimistic the recovery will continue.", "Please turn to slide six to review our financing plan. In May, we completed a significant financial goal with the successful execution of our $300 million equity-forward offering. This forward offering is unique for several reasons, including that we were able to parse the offering on May 11 at 93% of our 52-week high, just five days after the infamous flash crash, where we saw some of the highest volatility in the financial markets this year. Completing this particular financing structure allows us the flexibility to efficiently match our equity needs, with the timing of required capital for our nuclear projects, and to reduce financing risk, while minimizing share dilution, and raising the equity necessary to maintain our targeted capitalization ratios. Under the terms of this offering, we drew nearly $60 million in equity in the second quarter. Initial plans are to draw an additional $90 million in late 2010 and the balance of $150 million in 2011. The exact dates of the additional draws are subject to our actual operating results and additional sources of cash, both of which appear more favorable than a few months ago, given the economy, and the tax change I discussed earlier.", "As shown on slide six, this financing effectively eliminates our need for any additional equity offerings, beyond amounts generated through the 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plan until 2012.", "Now, on slide seven, I would like to review second quarter results for our principal lines of business. As a reminder, the large majority of our operations are regulated. These regulated utility businesses collectively represent approximately 95% of our total assets and annual earnings.", "South Carolina Electric and Gas Company, our largest subsidiary, reported earnings of $0.50 per share compared to $0.49 per share in the same quarter last year. The $0.01 increase is attributable primarily to customer growth resulting in improved electric and natural gas margins, and to regulatory outcomes in our 2009 Base Load Review Act (BLRA) and Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act or RSA filings, which more than offset higher O&M and interest expenses and dilution. At June 30, SCE&G was serving approximately 660,000 electric customers and approximately 310,000 natural gas customers, up 0.9% and 1.1% respectively from the same time last year.", "PSNC energy, our retail natural gas distribution company in North Carolina, reported a seasonal loss of $1 million or $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to breakeven results in the second quarter of 2009. This decline was due primarily to slightly higher O&M expenses and dilution, which more than offset customer growth. At June 30, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 468,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 1.5% over the last 12 months.", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a seasonal loss of $6 million or $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $3 million or $0.03 per share in the same quarter last year. This decline is primarily attributable to the lower margins arising from the warmer weather in 2010. At June 30, SCANA energy was serving approximately 450,000 customers, maintaining its position as the state's second-largest natural gas marketer. Last week, the Georgia PSC voted unanimously to extend the current two-year term for SCANA Energy's regulated division, Georgia's regulated natural gas provider, by one year to expire on August 31, 2012. The terms and conditions of the program remain the same. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss in the second quarter of 2010 of $2 million or $0.01 per share comparable to the same quarter last year.", "To summarize, on slide eight, based on strong year-to-date earnings, improvement in the economy, and our expectations for the remainder of the year, along with the successful execution of our equity-forward sale and the resolution of our retail electric rate case, we are raising the floor of our 2010 earnings guidance by $0.05 to $2.90 to $3.05 per share.", "There are several recent state regulatory filings I would like Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G to brief you on. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks, Jimmy. Getting on slide nine, I am pleased to report that our new nuclear project remains on schedule and on budget. On May 17, we filed our quarterly status report with the PSC and the ORS as required under our base load review order associated with our new nuclear activities. This report provides a detailed update of our capital costs incurred, and updated milestones of our new nuclear project and is available on our website. The updated gross construction cost through March 31, 2010, including escalation and AFPDC are $631 million below the PSC-approved amount. This reduction is due largely to favorable changes and projected escalation rates, which have been impacted by the recession.", "Also related to the new nuclear project, on June 21, 2010, the NRC issued a schedule letter to the listing house indicating that the design certification documentation review would conclude at the end of fiscal year 2011, which is September 2011. Based on this NRC commitment, we see no change to what we have previously communicated relative to obtaining our COL at the end of 2011 or early 2012.", "Continuing on slide 10 with line three, on May 28, we submitted our annual VLRA revised rate adjustment filings with the PSC for the annual recovery of financing costs related to CWIP. The requested overall ratings rate adjustment of 2.7% or $54.6 million annually was based on incremental CWIP incurred after June 2009 filings, and the updated capital structure. This $54.6 million request included actual CapEx till March 31, 2010, and projected capital expenditures through June 30. Due primarily to timings, we now know that our actual second quarter CapEx was slightly lower than originally forecasted in the revised rate filings and the updated amount of the expected increase in annual electric revenue is approximately $47 million. Keep in mind the ROE is set at 11% and new rates under this filing will go into effect at the end of October of this year, after our review by the Office of Regulatory Staff and approval by the PSC. Additionally, since our new equity transaction was completed in May, we were able to incorporate the initial proceeds of approximately $60 million into the cash structure that will be used to set the revised rates and as a result, mitigate the EPS dilution associated with the new shares outstanding.", "On June 15, SCE&G submitted its quarterly filings with the PSC if required under the Rate Stabilization Act for its gas distribution business. In that filing, the company reported that its return on common equity for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2010 was 12.92%, compared to an allowed return of 10.25%. This was largely due to the significant CapEx reductions and the O&M cost control measures. Since the actual equity was more than 50 points above our allowed return of 10.25%, SCE&G requested a 2.24% or $10 million decrease in its retail natural gas base rate in order to restore the return on equity to the 10.25% authorized level. This request would reduce the average residential customer's bill by about $100 a year if approved. Following a required audit of the company's filing by the ORS, the PSC will review both the companies' request and the ORS audit report and issue its order on our request in October. The rate adjustment will be affected with the first billing cycle in November.", "Turning now to our 2010 retail electric rate base on slide 11, on June 30, the PSC voted to approve the stipulations presented by the parties in the case, resulting in an overall increase in annual retail electric revenues of approximately $101 million or 4.88% for South Carolina Electric and Gas Company. The PSC granted the company a 10.7% allowed return on equity, and approved the use of a weather normalization adjustment or WNA on a 12-month trial basis beginning in August. This WNA adjustment bases billing to residential and commercial customers on a 15 year historical weather average, and will help reduce the impact that is normally caused by cold weather on customer's electric boots. Revised rates were effective on July 16, 2010; and from a customer perspective, an increase of $101 million will be mitigated by two decrement writers.", "The first decrement relates to a one-time $25 million weather-related credit, given to SCE&G's residential and small general service customers. This decrement will remain in place for approximately one year or until the $25 million is exhausted.", "The second decrement relates to economic impact zone state tax credits, or EIZ credits, of approximately $48 million that will be credited to customers over approximately two years. Although both of these decrements put downward pressure on custom bills, the company has already collected these amounts in cash and deferred them as credits on its balance sheet. Over the next two years, while customer's bills reduced through writers approved by the PSC, these deferred credits will be amortized into earnings in the same amount and over the same period that the writers impact customers' bills.", "As a result, the company's revenues will reflect the full increase approved by the PSC effective July 16, 2010, and earnings will not be negatively affected. Due to the recognition of these and other credits, as well as considering the tax method change Jimmy discussed, we expect SCANA's effective tax rate for 2010 to be approximately 29%. A copy of the final rate order can be found on the PSC's website.", "That concludes our prepared remarks, and Jimmy and I will now be glad to respond to any questions that you might have. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium [ph]. Please proceed.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Good afternoon.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good afternoon.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Could you just mention to us where do you see the loan guarantee stuff, I guess Constellation came out yesterday, and they said theirs was the only file being approved by the credit review and they were the furthest ahead. Could you just talk about where you stand, and any chances you see that amount is going to be increased and whether SCANA is going to be able to dip into the full?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, this is Kevin. We continue to watch and see what happens with the loan guarantees. We have been through part of the due diligence process with DOE and that will be scheduled to pick up again later this year. The amount of the loan guarantees, as you know, there was an initial $18.5 billion of it was out there, and the DOE has been trying to side hat, wants to advocate that, Southern has gotten the first approval and we are anxious to see the terms and conditions that they have, because I think the overall terms and conditions, you know, would impact our interest in the loans. We have said from day one that it wasn't something that we had to have, but if we felt like it was advantageous for our customers and for the project, we would certainly want to understand more about those before we committed ourselves for the 30-year term of those loans, if they are available. So we will continue evaluating that process, we look forward to hearing more from the DOE and the federal government about what those terms and conditions will look like, if we try to conclude that evaluation, and make that just as soon as we can, which I would certainly expect we would do that before the end of the year, based on what we know today.", "Again, I would reiterate, as we have said from day one, it has not been necessary, in our opinion, to have the loan guarantees, while they would allow you to finance, in my understanding, up to 80% of your project with the federal loans, we have always said we would do our project 50/50 debt and equity, and that is what we have been doing based on the financing schedule that Jimmy has discussed with you. So we will wait to learn as much as we can before we make the final commitment.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "But Kevin, aren't the terms, I guess Southern has already completed its negotiation, right, a month ago? Aren't the terms known to you guys as to whether you want to avail them or not? I mean, Southern completed their negotiations, if I am right, five weeks back or something like that?", "Kevin Marsh", "They have indicated that they have negotiated an agreement with DOE, but nobody has been forthcoming with the complete listing of terms and conditions. So, no, unfortunately, we have not seen that.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay. And then the second question, the tax thing, is that a permanent or is that just for this year, can you just go over it?", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure. No, it is a permanent change and the real benefit of this magnitude is due to a one-time catch-up. So what happens is, we expect to generate approximately $100 million from the historical catch-up of this change in method, and it will apply prospectively, but the impact prospectively will be very small, so you really only notice this one-time change, but we would expect it will be in place permanently. So it is kind of a one-time permanent benefit.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "So next year, your tax rate goes back up? Is that correct?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. Well, both taxes will not change. So it is just a switch between current and deferred for financial statement purposes.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "How should we model the next year's taxes? Should we look at it on a 29% or is the tax rate \u2013", "Jimmy Addison", "Probably slightly higher, yes, 31%, something like that.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay. And then, can I just ask you, what kind of ROEs should we expect with the rate order now, you know, complete and all that, what kind of ROEs would you expect to be able to earn from this order?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right. Well, of course, we are allowed 11% on the nuclear CWIP, but I presume you are talking about the rest of the electric business.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "That is correct.", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay. So what we are looking for hopefully is continued growth in the economy to help supplement any expense growth. We have, I think, done a fantastic job of controlling costs and controlling CapEx during this period, slowing it to or below the growth and the customers, but now, as we see customer growth come back, we are certainly going to have to restore some of that, but we really expect, and let me just say this internally, our target is to be right asset return. We are going to work very hard to be at that return. Kevin has charged his team as well as the supporting groups to support that organization to really manage towards that, work hard in our planning process to let put a plan together to deliver something very close to that allowed return prospect. And Kevin, do you want to add anything?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes. And I think Jimmy has made a very accurate point. A lot of this is dependent on where the growth comes in the next three to four years. If we see, the growth return to the 2.5% level that we have enjoyed prior to the recession, that will give us a lot of flexibility and what level of capital we can employ and what our expense levels can be. But with that being said, we have been very, very diligent in looking at those costs and engage literally every operation in any organization help us maintain that. You know, in the order, we have agreed not to come back in for a base rate electric increase over a two-year period, and we will work hard to ensure that that doesn\u2019t happen, and I believe we have got a very good chance of owning right at the returns, they also allows us to earn.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay, and if I could just end up, Jimmy; in this year's forecast, what is the return expectations in this year's forecast?", "Jimmy Addison", "The return on equity?", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Yes, for 2010?", "Jimmy Addison", "You mean an overall blended number or \u2013?", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "No. Just for the \u2013 if you just take, you know, what the rate case, rate base and everything, for that portion of the business, what is the return expected?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, I think it is similar to what Kevin just said. I mean, I think our goal is to be very near those allowed returns.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "So you expect to be there this year on a \u2013", "Jimmy Addison", "I do, of course. We will be using a historical test here at the end of September of 2009, but we have got additional customers that were not on the system at that point, and industrial growth is coming back. So we have got some positives as well. And additionally, we have got the benefit of the less volatility because of the weather normalization going forward, so we have taken some of that risk off the table.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Jimmy Addison", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Good afternoon.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hello, Paul.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "I wanted to ask you about the \u2013 when you said two years, you are out for two years. Could you just give us an idea as to starting at what time frame is the two year climb across the regulatory base rate refund?", "Jimmy Addison", "That two-year clock would've started the day we filed this case, the latest case, which I believe is January 15, 2010. So we couldn't have filed another case on to roughly January of 2012. You have the same six-month review process, but that is when it is filed, so it could be either two years from the date we filed it or two days from the Commission's order. So they were right about the same time from the time slots perspective. And that is, if you go back and look at our schedule, Paul, you have followed us for a long time, you know, we have nearly not been in for every, two or three years. So that is something we feel confident we will be able to do.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. I was going to follow-up with a question. You did mention that you guys had kept costs somewhat under control because of the economy, but that you were hoping the economy could \u2013 as customer growth increases that that will help you guys out. Should we think of there as being substantial economic risk if we have the slow recovery or not a very double dip kind of scenario?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, Paul, I think as I have discussed in past quarters, I mean, the things that we have throttled back on cost-wise have been areas where we felt we had, if you will, a variable match to the lack of growth or up lack of strong growth, we continue to have growth even in the toughest quarters, a year ago or so. So, we really feel like we have got the ability to increase those costs back at the rate that the economy comes back. For example, Kevin has got roughly 300 less contractors on his system today than he did two years ago. If the economy doesn't come back to what it was two years ago immediately, and certainly it is not back to that point yet, then he just doesn't add that level of resources back. And those are not insignificant, 300 headcount.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Sure, absolutely. Could you also give us just a generalized sort of EPS weather impact as roughly speaking that you guys have seen for the first six months?", "Jimmy Addison", "The first six months, well, generally, from a financial standpoint, it is what is there in the second quarter, because for the first quarter, you remember we basically reserved the weather and gave that back as part of this weather reserve, this $25 million that we are spreading over the next year. But for the first six months, I think it is roughly in the $0.06 to $0.08 above normal.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great. And then just with wholesale sales, they decreased. Is that basically because of more retail growth or could you give us a little flavor on them?", "Jimmy Addison", "The wholesale decrease was due solely to the, primarily, to the expiration of a contract with a small municipality that expired last year, late in the second half of last year. We are no longer serving that municipality; I think that was the City of Greenwood. So that is all that relates to.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Chris Ellinghaus with Wellington Shields. Please proceed.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Hey, everybody, how are you?", "Jimmy Addison", "Good, Chris.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Jimmy, can I go back to the weather question again and the impact and I am sort of trying to (inaudible) here. When you say $0.68, are you including SCANA Energy in that number?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I was talking about electric.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay, just electric?", "Jimmy Addison", "And that was versus, you know, versus normal weather.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay. And you are excluding from that the first quarter deferrals?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay. So, can I infer that most of that is the second quarter, then?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay. Kevin, can you just go back to the terms of the RSA filing again?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, on the gas side, we update that once a year, and we have been authorized to earn 10.25%, and if we earn less than that, more than 50 points less than that, we can file for an increase; if it is more than 50 basis points above, then we actually go and ask for a decrease. So where we found ourselves this time was about 12.9% compared to the 10.25%, so we made that filing. We requested they lower our rates about 2.24%, which would be a $10 million decrease in the base rates for natural gas.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay, great. Can you also, Jimmy, characterize SCANA Energy's weather in Atlanta versus normal?", "Jimmy Addison", "For Q2?", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Yes.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. It was \u2013 versus normal, I would say, I don't have a normal comparison at my fingertips, Chris, but I would say it was probably slightly milder than normal, and the last year's second quarter was colder than normal, so it was going in opposite directions. But you know, just a guesstimate, I would say, maybe a penny or two compared to normal in Q2.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay, great. And lastly, could you give us any kind of color or update on what is going on with Boeing?", "Jimmy Addison", "With Boeing?", "Kevin Marsh", "There is just a tremendous amount of activity in the state for Boeing, not just in North Charleston, where they have put their plant that they have been, as you would expect, a lot of other ancillary facilities starting to pop up in that area, as well as some in the upstate, they are going to be serving that facility. I think we talked about that last time. The group is going to provide all of the internal upholstery-type components and the fittings for the inside the aircraft, so they are going to be here. A Board meeting earlier this week, we talked about the relative impact to the State of South Carolina. It talked about upwards of, you know, $9000 in jobs created, cost of state by the time this thing is fully implemented, you know direct, you know a little over 5700 directly associated with them; you know indirectly, about 1800 and then about 2200 in just induced jobs as a result of them coming to the state. So, you know, we believe this is a similar BMW-type impact that you saw on the upstate, you know, 10 to 15 years ago and just a great thing for the system. They will come online, stock production mid next year and have everything online I believe in 2012.", "Jimmy Addison", "I can tell you, I personally, I flew out of the Charleston airport where they are locating adjacent to last month, and there is tremendous activity going on there.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay, have you got any metrics or any kind of color that you can provide as to what it is going to mean to you?", "Kevin Marsh", "We are working with them specifically on their contract, which we are not completed with yet. This is not a huge user and it is all in just in terms of the amount of electricity that you use in the plant, compared to something like a steel electric arc foundry for melting down steel. So the plant itself will not be huge, but we think the combination of people that move into the area, the ancillary businesses, what will really have the biggest impact, but we have not made an absolute projection we are comfortable to be releasing at this point.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.", "Jimmy Addison", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Board. Please proceed.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Board", "Good afternoon. I wondering if you could give a little more color on the pickup in industrial sales that you are seeing in terms of like sectors and maybe totally certain users and what other.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Dan, it has rarely been a cost to Board, that was one of the first questions I asked myself and dug into our data and it is really across all classes, chemicals, steel, home construction with the rebound in home sales in the first half of the year. So there is really growth across all the sectors, paper and associated products, rubber, plastics, et cetera. So there is no one category which is a good sign. It is really diversified.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Board", "Okay. How about in the commercial, it seems to be kind of lagging in the areas as you are seeing some business close down there or what is kind of going on in that sector?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, commercial is net up as is residential, just not to the level that industrial is, and I think it is, I don't think the commercial in the south is that different than commercial in some other areas, I mean they were certainly during the building boom of 2006 and 2007. The commercial got a little in front of itself. So, I mean, yes, there is still some unoccupied new commercial facilities around, but we were not selling to them before either, so it is not like we have lost load to them. But there are some vacancies, but there is nothing real demonstrator that that stands out to me. Kevin, any \u2013", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, I mean, I think that commercial sector was really hit hard in 2008 and 2009 just because of their size and the types of businesses that they are. They don't have to stay in power as the large industrial customers. So while the industrials can pick up fairly quickly when the economy turns around, it is a matter of ramping up their business, where I think on the commercial side, people wait to decide if they want to get back in the business, and start those organizations back up. So it has typically been a little bit of a lagger behind some of the others, and I think you will see that the rest of the year.", "Jimmy Addison", "And on the industrial side, I mean, year to date, we are up about 10.8% at the end of first quarter, our industrials in the electric side were up 6.9%, I recollect. So, you know, in the second quarter itself, they were up almost 15%. So I am not suggesting as I told the Board this morning if you can graph that linearly into the future from 7% to 15% to 20% plus, but it is the right direction.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Board", "Okay. And then lastly, I just wanted to pick up on where you add on the CapEx for this year.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, we are, at this point through the year, we are slightly behind our CapEx forecast for the year, and some of that is related clearly to our new nuclear project and we forecast in each year some contingency, and we have been very fortunate that we have had to use an extremely small amount of that contingency to date, so that is one of the significant reasons we are behind, if any, on CapEx.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, we just had an all hands meeting a couple of weeks ago, with all of our leadership team at SCE&G, and we talked a lot about what it is going to take in the next two or three years to manage our rates and balance out with the level of growth we have which is what Jimmy referred to earlier, and we made it very clear with some straightforward diagrams that our rates are driven simply by our customer growth, capital spending, and then our overall expense levels. And to the extent that we keep those three balanced will be just fun. If we find areas where expenses creep up, we have either got to manage it on the customer growth side or on the capital spending side. So securely, the ones we have the most control over are capital spending and expenditures.", "But our team clearly has its arms around what we are trying to wrestle and I am confident we can improve our ability to manage that as we go forward. I think we told you last time and I know we have talked at a couple of presentations, Jimmy and I have been asked to do this is trying to make sure we look at what we are depreciating on an annual basis from the capital side, and mathematically, if you can manage your capital growth to that level, you are certainly off to a good start and that is not the end of it, but we understand the metrics, our team is understanding the metrics, and last year, has given them a real chance to see how this process works, having been into the regulatory environment and while we were going through this recession, really brought it to light, and we are going to try to keep working on that model very hard and that is the challenge we got in front of us, to balance all those components and try to achieve what the commission wants us to do, with the investors want us to do, and what we feel like the right thing to do to operate the business (inaudible).", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Board", "Okay, thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two quick housekeeping questions, hopefully. Do you have the weather-adjusted sales numbers for residential and commercial?", "Jimmy Addison", "I do not have residential and commercial as far as TWH, not weather-adjusted.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "I mean, is it safe to say, you know, that they are still, you know, positive, you know \u2013", "Jimmy Addison", "You mean, net of weather, Jonathan?", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Yes, net of weather.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, I do have it on an EPS perspective. We estimate that net of weather, that the customer consumption generated about $0.01 per share in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. So same customers, net of weather, we estimate they used $1 million or so more than they did a year ago.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay, and then, later on top of that, the customer growth, and then the weather?", "Jimmy Addison", "Exactly. So we have got the weather, the consumption coming back, the customer growth, and then the BLRA increase from last November, those are the four components driving electric margin.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay and what was the customer growth, what was the EPS impact that you guys estimate?", "Jimmy Addison", "$0.01 to $0.02.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay and then I kind of missed a little bit in the beginning regarding that tax item, you said there was kind of a catch up component to it in addition to the ongoing and I heard $0.03, was that the catch-up component?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, it is kind of the indirect impact of the catch-up. The catch-up is the $100 million of cash that is the benefit from the tax change, but the cost effectively zeros out our taxable income, we lose an unrelated tax deduction for one year, and that unrelated tax deduction cost us about $0.03 per share this quarter.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "So because we do not have any taxable income to apply the deduction to, so that is why we have got to take that charge this quarter, but it is a $0.03 charge to gain a $100 million in cash, and then you can do some pretty math around the ongoing benefit of kind of a permanent $100 million in cash if you just presume it all came out of debt, net of 6% embedded rate that is $6 million a year we are going to save long term in debt cost continually.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay and then is there any like ongoing EPS impact or is it just the cash benefit then going forward?", "Jimmy Addison", "It is very moderate. It would be lost in the rounding [ph]. There is a small incremental benefit going forward but it is not even worth modeling.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "But we will certainly account for it; but not worth trying to model prospectively.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "All right. I appreciate that. Thank you, guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ellinghaus with Wellington Shields. Please proceed.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay. Just going back to the tax true-up in the quarter, have you got a dollar number for that?", "Jimmy Addison", "That is $0.03 a share, so it is roughly $2 million a share, $6 million or so.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "Again, that is the wealth of the unrelated deduction because we have no taxable income.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Right.", "Jimmy Addison", "We will know more later in the year, Chris, about the actual cash benefit, and we will certainly keep you updated at our third quarter and year-end call. The $100 million is just an estimate at this point.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay and as far as thinking about the third and fourth quarters, obviously I am assuming that that tax benefit that you are going to forego is something that you were taking last year?", "Jimmy Addison", "The benefit is in the cash. First of all, the $0.03 charge is a non-cash charge because we are going to zero out income taxes over the next few estimated payment periods, but we will actually get the cash benefit in over the next nine to twelve months.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "I was just thinking about you saying that it is an unrelated tax deduction that you will not be able to take because of the new election. So is that something that you were collecting last year? So, is that something that will have any kind of negative drag in the third, fourth quarter for something that you are no longer taking a deduction on?", "Jimmy Addison", "We have taken the estimated impact for the full year in Q2.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay. And Kevin, you were talking about the updated BLRA coming in so much below the prior approval, is that having any impact on intervener consternation over the escalator at all?", "Kevin Marsh", "Not that I am aware of. We have the pending case at the South Carolina Supreme Court where one of the parties to the case energy users had appealed the provision about the contingency dollars, and the ability to calculate escalation on top of that. That is the opinion at the Supreme Court, but we have not heard a lot from the interveners since they went back and got our revised schedule. Last year, we have just been working to plan to provide the information to the commissioners, and we are pleased that we are well on schedule and on budget at this point.", "Jimmy Addison", "Chris, let me just add, there really is no intervention in the BLRA process as far as these annual filings. I mean, we filed the request, the ORS audits it turns in their report, which they will do tomorrow on July 30, and then the Commission reviews it and grants the increase effective at the end of October. So the difference here occurred because we have to file the report in early May, and when we filed it, we had to estimate our CWRP [ph] at the end of June. Now, as we got to the end of June, we had not spent as much as we expected, which is purely just due to timing of some components and parts of the project. So it is nothing that is off-schedule or anything like that.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "No, I was just kind of curious whether the folks that are concerned about the escalator were somewhat impressed by your revised numbers.", "Jimmy Addison", "You mean the $600 million?", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Yes.", "Jimmy Addison", "They are about the only people to talk much about the escalation, wanted to talk about it when it had initially increased $600 million.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Exactly.", "Jimmy Addison", "And so now that it is coming down, there is an eerie silence.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Yes, I was kind of curious whether that was the case.", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I missed your point. I thought you were talking about the $7 million difference this year. I am sorry.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "No it really cuts both ways, sometimes it goes against you and sometimes it goes for you, and I have not heard a thing about their thoughts subsequent to the filing.", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I have not either and as I testified in the hearing room when we initially approved this, I mean, inflation is going to be what inflation is, this is nothing but a projection of what inflation might be and that is going to change each time they produce the index.", "Kevin Marsh", "And I think it is important to understand that even when we were in that position where we have predicted the escalation will be more than what we originally presented to the Commission. That is not a violation of the order.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Right.", "Kevin Marsh", "The order just recognizes and approves the mechanism. So whether it is up or down based on what we forecast, as long as you are following the mechanism in your base cost and what you estimated correctly, there is no issue with the commission.", "Jimmy Addison", "I agree with your point. I mean, frankly, it is a lot like the RSA Kevin described. Usually in larger economic growth times, there is a small increase each year while the mechanism cuts both ways. This year there was a decrease because we really controlled cost and growth slowed so there is a small decrease.", "Kevin Marsh", "But nobody is called to complain.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Yes, exactly. Thanks for the color.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, you bet.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of David Paz [ph] with BofA Merrill Lynch.", "David Paz \u2013 BofA/Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hello.", "David Paz \u2013 BofA/Merrill Lynch", "Most of my questions have been answered but I just have one on the $1.1 billion credit facility, you believe it expires at the end of next year, any update on the renewal?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, we are working on that now, and I expect we will have that wrapped up later this year. I am very confident we will. Our intention is to get it renewed before the end of this calendar year, sooner rather than later, but we are actively working on it, and our intentions are likely to increase the size of it somewhat.", "David Paz \u2013 BofA/Merrill Lynch", "Great, thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Jimmy Addison for closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you. Let me just say that in summary, I think we have had a very good quarter and a solid first half of the year. We are pleased that the electric rate proceeding is behind us, our financing for 2010 is essentially complete, and our capital structure will be further improved by the cash benefit of this tax change we discussed. We continued to see core growth and we are cautiously optimistic about the economic indicators in our territories.", "We thank you very much for your interest in SCANA.

", "At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call.  (Operator instructions)", "As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Wednesday, October 27, 2010.  Anyone who does not consent the taping may drop off the line at this time.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.  Please proceed. ", "Byron Hinson", "Thanks, Towanda, and welcome to our Earnings Conference Call, including those who are joining us on the webcast.", "As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2010 and in a minute, Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G will review those results and respond to your questions.  Slides and the earnings release that we\u2019ll refer to in these calls are available at SCANA.com.", "As a reminder, certain statements that may be made during today's call, which are not statements of historical fact, are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are shown on Slide 2 and discussed in the company's SEC filings.  The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Thanks Byron, and good afternoon.  I\u2019d also like to welcome each of you to our call.  Let\u2019s start on Slide 3, which reflects SCANA\u2019s third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.80 compared to $0.84 per share in 2009.  The decline in third quarter earnings was due primarily to the resolution of a State income tax issue which contributed $0.11 per share in 2009. ", "Other major variants for the third quarter were improved electric margins resulting from electric base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, and the Retail Electric Rate Case, which more than offset higher net interest expense, higher property taxes, slightly higher O&M expenses, and share dilution.", "With regard to the state income tax issue, SCANA recognized the benefit of a favorable decision from the South Carolina Supreme Court, in the third quarter of 2009.  This decision related to state investment tax credits earned during construction of our co plant in 1996.  Prior to this Supreme Court decision, and pursuant to the relevant accounting literature concerning income tax uncertainties, the value of the contestant credit had not been reflected in our income statement. ", "The multi-year catch-up resulted in $0.11 per share impact in the third quarter of 2009.  ", "Additionally, in the third quarter of 2010, we implemented the Electric Weather Normalization mechanism beginning with bills rendering in August.  The mechanism applies to residential and commercial customers and resulted in a residential credit of $24 million or $0.12 per share and a commercial credit of $4 million or $0.02 per share during the quarter.  As a result of the W&A mechanisms at SCE&G, both electric and gas, and the PSNC Customer Utilization Tracker, our prospective regulated earnings which comprise over 90% of our total, are more predictable for our shareholders and the effects of abnormal weather on customers\u2019 bills are mitigated.", "Let me briefly comment on the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share as mentioned in Note 2.  As you\u2019re aware, in May we entered an equity-forward to provide for the balance of our equity needs for 2010 and 2011 to support our construction program.  ", "Basic earnings per share reflect the shares we have actually issued during the year.  In contrast, diluted earnings per share include the effect of a calculated number of a potential, or incremental shares that would have been outstanding if we had issued the shares under the forward contracts.", "That small incremental number or additional share and the denominator results in diluted EPS being marginally lower than basic EPS.  In this quarter, the difference amounted to $0.01 per share.  If our stock price stays above contract forward price, we expect similar small amounts of potential dilution over the next few quarters.", "Basic earnings for the first nine months of 2010 were 225 per share compared to 223 in 2009, which again, included $0.11 per share related to the state income tax issue.  The year-to-date increase in earnings was driven primarily by improved electric and gas margins due to regulatory outcomes and customer growth.  ", "I\u2019ll comment more on customer growth later, but it\u2019s important to note that each of our four major retail businesses continue to add customers compared to last year.  These margins improvements were offset by higher interest expense, higher property taxes, slightly higher O&M expenses, and share dilution.", "We\u2019re pleased to see continued signs of economic recovery in our service territory.  As shown on Slide 4, kilowatt hour sales of electricity to our retail customers in the third quarter were up 8.4% compared to the same quarter in 2009.  The residential class showed an increase of 10.8%, while industrial and commercial classes followed with increases of 8.4 and 5.9% respectfully.", "Overall, total kilowatt hour sales of electricity which includes sales to other utilities were up 7.6%.  As you may remember, our W&A and cut mechanisms normalized margin and not kilowatt hours or therm sales, therefore, weather certainly impacted residential and commercial kilowatt hour sales.  But industrials, which have minimal weather impact, continue to show a strong recovery compared to 2009.", "On Slide 5, consolidated therm sales were up 20.6% over the third quarter of 2009, driven by higher industrial sales primarily attributable to power generation customers, which more than offset a decline in residential and commercial and sales for resale, principally due to a warm September.", "Now, on Slide 6, I\u2019d like to review third quarter results for our principal lines of business.  South Carolina Electric and Gas Company, our largest subsidiary reported basic earnings per share of $0.87 compared to $0.89 per share in the same quarter last year.  The decrease is attributable primarily to the state tax benefit recorded in 2009.  Electric and natural gas margins were higher due to regulatory outcomes in our Base Load Review Act, and Natural Gas Rates Stabilization Act filings, and the successful completion of the Retail Electric Rate Case in July of this year.", "These improved margins were offset by higher interest expense, higher property taxes, slightly higher O&M expenses, and share dilution.", "At September 30, 2010, SCE&G was serving approximately 660,000 electric customers and approximately 309,000 natural gas customers, both up approximately 1% from the same time last year.", "PSNC Energy, our retail natural gas distribution company in North Carolina, reported a seasonal loss of $0.04 per share the third quarter of 2010, unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2009.  This result is due to a slightly higher gas margin offset by higher depreciation of property taxes.", "At September 30, 2010, PSNC was serving approximately 468,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 1.6% over the last 12 months.", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a seasonal loss of $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2010; also unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2009.  ", "At September 30, 2010, SCANA energy was serving more than 445,000 customers.  SCANA Energy has worked very diligently on customer retention and acquisition, and as a result, we have gained over 4,000 net customers over the last 12 months in a fairly flat overall market.", "SCANA\u2019s Corporate and other businesses reported a loss in the third quarter of 2010 of $0.01 per share compared to earnings of $0.01 per share in the same quarter last year.  ", "I would now like to touch on our financing plan and cash flow.  ", "As you may recall in the second quarter, we discussed a change in income tax accounting for capital maintenance.  This change in tax accounting affects certain types of calls previously treated as property additions and deducted through depreciation over the related asset\u2019s life.  ", "With this change, all such maintenance will instead be treated as current expense for income tax purposes.  This strategy is expected to provide even more than our initial estimate of $100 million in cash flow in 2010 and 11.  ", "Additionally, we were able to take advantage of the recent extension of bonus depreciation, which allows 50% of qualifying assets to be expensed for tax purposes, and results in an incremental estimated $50 million in cash flow.  ", "Combined, these changes eliminate our taxable income on our 2009 return, and substantially reduced our 2010 estimated payments.  In total, these actions provide us an estimated 150 to $175 million in near-term cash flow. ", "This improved cash flow will be used to mitigate external capital requirements.  ", "As mentioned earlier, in May we completed a $300 million equity transaction with $240 million in a forward structure.  We have planned to draw in an additional $90 million under the forward, later this year, and the balance of $150 million in 2011.  Based on the improved cash flow provided through these tax strategies, we do now not anticipate needing to make those draws until late 2011, allowing us the flexibility to efficiently match our equity needs with the timing of capital requirements for our nuclear project and to reduce financing risk, all while minimizing real share dilution. ", "The exact dates of additional draws are subject to our actual operating results and additional sources of cash, but ultimately, our intentions are that these tax strategies will reduce plan debt offerings.  We\u2019re very pleased with the flexibility the forward structure has provided.  ", "Finally, we\u2019re very pleased to report that earlier this week we successfully completed this indication of an expanded credit facility.  ", "Please see Slide 7.  The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction, and the five-year tenure expends substantially all of the plan construction period of the first new unit.", "The committed lines of credit now total 1.5 billion, have terms of five years, and replace the prior committed credit facilities which total 1.1 billion.  The new lines of credit consist of 300 million for SCANA, 100 million for PSNC, 400 million for South Carolina Fuel Company, and 700 million for SCE&G.", "As part of this new expanded facility, we have also arranged for SCANA to operate a commercial paper program providing us even more financing flexibility.", "I\u2019d like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and supporting our nuclear expansion plans.  We are pleased that we received an excellent response from equity investors, debt investors and now our banks. ", "From a financial standpoint, we\u2019ve had a solid quarter and are pleased with implementation of our new electric base rates and the renewal of our credit facilities.  The tax strategies mentioned only strengthen our plan, especially when combined with the flexibility of the equity forward.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G for a regulatory and construction update.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks Jimmy.  Beginning on Slide 8, I am very pleased to report that our new nuclear project remains on schedule and on budget.  ", "On August 16, we filed our quarterly status report with the PSC and the Office Regulatory Staff, as required under our Base Load Review Order.  This report provides a detailed update of our capital cost incurred, and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website.  Due to the following deadline, the figures in this report include the 438 million contingency fund, which in early August the South Carolina Supreme Court, determined should be excluded from the capital cost projections approved under the Base Load Review Act. ", "Adjusted figures will be supplied in future quarterly BLRA filings.  Updated gross construction cost of June 30, 2010, including escalation and AFUDC are $648 million below the revised scheduled forecast.  This production is largely to lower estimates of projected escalation rates, which have been impacted by the recession.  ", "Let me expand on the South Carolina Supreme Court opinion and its impact on the treatment of contingency funds.  ", "As initially authorized by the PSC in 2008 and 2009, the capital cost schedule for the new nuclear project included a pre-approved contingency reserve of $438 million.  ", "On August 9, South Carolina Supreme Court ruled this contingency reserve could not be pre-approved as a component of construction cost by the PSC.  Instead, the company is now required to submit all cost for approval by the PSC as they are identified to specific budget items.  The projected contingency fund that was initially approved by the commission was less than 10% of the total nuclear project budget.  All of the portions of the Base Load Review Order, remain intact, and construction of the new units is continuing as planned. ", "I want to emphasize that this decision does not delay the actual construction of the new unit, nor does it change the certificate of environmental compatibility and convenience issued by the Commission to construct the new unit.  The Supreme Court ruling, merely changes the steps in the regulatory process, and it should not change the outcome as long as the cost incurred remain proven.", "I would like to direct your attention to Slide 9, which shows on the total project basis that the current projected nuclear plant construction cost, including estimated escalation is approximately $1 billion under the forecasted file cost included in our initial BLRA filings from 2008.  Additionally, you will note on the slide, in the red dash circle, we have approximately $6 million in the committed category compared to the projected total project cost of 9.6 million. ", "Earlier this week, we disclosed that the company plans to file an application with the PSC to update the approved capital cost schedule for the new nuclear project.  The requested update will be for an amount between 150 and $200 million and $2,007.  We anticipate making the filing within the next 30 days.  ", "The cost in question will be incurred over the course of construction project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2019.  The company still anticipates completing the project within the original budget estimate that included the contingency projection of 438 million and is simply responding to the court\u2019s decision, seeking commission approval to reclassify these costs in contingency fund to specific budget categories.", "As you can see on Slide 10, on August 10, SCE&G, acting for itself and its agent Santee Cooper, agreed with Westinghouse, and Stone Webster to shift significant additional portions of the EPC contract components from the target category to the fixed cost, and fixed cost with escalation categories.  ", "As a result of this agreement, approximately 2/3 of the total EPC contract call are now in these fixed-cost categories.  We are very pleased with this development and believe these shifts serve to further insulate us for cost overrun and lower overall risk of the project.", "Continuing on Slide 11, if you may recall, on May 28, SCE&G filed for the increase on its annual revised rate adjustment filings with the PSC under provisions of the South Carolina and BLR rate.  The BLRA allows for annual adjustments to rates during construction of the new nuclear units as means of recovering financing cost related to CWIC.  ", "On October 1, 2010, the PSC improved an increase of 47.3 million or approximately 2.3% in the retail electric rates of SCE&G under the Base Load Review Act.  The new rates are expected for bills rendered on and after October 30.  ", "Several media articles in the past few months have stated that Santee Cooper, the stated utility, involved in our nuclear project may seek a partner to share and it\u2019s 45% ownership in the construction of EC Summer Units 2 and 3.  ", "Their decision does not affect our ownership stake of the project.  ", "As we have discussed with you over the last two quarters, SCE&G has been advised by Santee Cooper, and in light of recent development it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long-term power supply plan, including the level of this participation in the two units.  If Santee Cooper\u2019s ownership interest and one or both of the units changes, SCE&G believes that one or more of this additional parties will be available to participate as joint owners.", "On June 15, SCE&G submitted its quarterly filing to the CSC as required under the Rate Stabilization Act, for the gas distribution business.  In that filing, the company reported its return on common equity for the 12 months period, ended March 31, 2010, was 12.92% compared to an allowed return of 10.25%.  This was largely due to the significant capital expenditure reduction and O&M cost control measures, and response to the recession.", "[Inaudible] equity with more than 50 basis points above our allowed return of 10.25%, SCE&G requested a decrease in its retail natural gas base rate in order to restore the return on equity to the 10.25% authorized level.", "October 15, 2010 following a required audit of the company\u2019s filing of the ORS, the PSC issued an order approving a decrease in retail gas rates of approximately 10.4 million or 2.31%.  The rate adjustment will be effective with the first billing cycle in November.", "That concludes our prepared remarks, and Jimmy and I will now be glad to respond to any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.  Please proceed.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey, guys.  I just \u2013 a lot of moving parts regarding the BLRA and the summer build.  I just want to make sure I understand one of the basics.  What are you now saying the cash cost of construction will be between today and the end of the project, and then the total cash cost? ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "Let me flip to that slide.  I think that was Slide 8 or 9.  You see the gross construction cost on that slide?  This is Slide 8.  We expect the total cost based on what we know today, including installation would be $5.8 million, the five being 896,976 in the second column which excludes AFUDC.  ", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  And then less escalation, I\u2019m just trying to make sure I'm following the bridge because some of these has changed since the original filing - follow the bridge from that total project cash flow done to the capital cost in \u201907 dollars? ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "When we made the filing with the commission, it was in \u201907 dollars and included projected escalation, but \u201907 dollars just references back to the actual contract and then building the escalation on top of that to give you the total cash we expect to expend.  ", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So if I think about your rate-base addition over the life of the project, excluding AFUDC, it\u2019s the 5.9 and then you add in the AFUDC which is limited amounts given the fact you had a two-time a year rate increase?", "Kevin Marsh", "", "That\u2019s correct.  The budget dollars, we show that we work to that 5.9 billion.  ", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it.  Okay.  Thank you.  One other thing, can you disclose what are the kind of items that are still left unfixed in your contract with, you know, with Westinghouse and with Shaw?  You know, kind of \u2013what comprises the red bar?", "Kevin Marsh", "", "The majority of that is labor, time and effort on the labor aspects of actually constructing the project.  ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yeah, the parts and labor on site.  Obviously, a lot of it is done modularly, but the labor on site.  ", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it.  And isn\u2019t that, given what\u2019s happening in the economy, isn\u2019t that kind of moving your direction in terms of cost? ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "Well, I think with the recession we\u2019ve had a good time here, but unfortunately all of those calls could be down.  And certainly we\u2019ve got a long time to go, but everything we\u2019re expending now is coming in under budget because we\u2019re enjoying the low escalation rates.  Just yearly costs are lower in the industry right now.  ", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it.  Okay, thank you, guys. ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "Sure. ", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your next question comes from the line of Mark Declasit [ph] with FBR Capital Markets.  Please proceed. ", "Mark Declasit [ph] \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Thank you very much, and good afternoon.  Two questions.  The first is, as you consider the recent contractual and regulatory changes to New Nuclear, your project here, would you say that the risk of the project has gone up or gone down at this point?  And if so, what is the basis for that answer? ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "Well, in my it\u2019s really unchanged at the present time for a couple of reasons.  First, the level of contingency calls we had include in the initial base-load review filing were less than 10% of the total cost of the project.  When the Supreme Court decided that those costs could not be included in the pre-approved amount set forth by the Commission, they did not say we couldn\u2019t recover those costs.  They simply said, before we could include those in the base-load review recovery provisions we would have to go back to the Commission and we specifically identified where those dollars would be spent and then the condition could include those in the base-load review cost.  ", "And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in this filing we expect to make in the next 30 days.  We\u2019ve made our projections and we\u2019ve identified a level of certain costs we know we\u2019re going to be spending and we\u2019ll simply be taking that back to the Commission and presenting it to them for their consideration.  ", "We believe these costs, as with all the other costs in the project are prudent and there are no surprises in these costs.  We fully expect to be using this contingency fund in this manner.  We\u2019ve just got the additional step at this point of having to go back to the Commission as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.  ", "Jimmy Addison", "And Mark, in addition to that I\u2019d say the move that Kevin talked about earlier with the contract now, it was slightly over 50% was fixed \u2013 fixed, with an escalator now is 2/3s, so outside of the contingency discussion, I\u2019d say that that is a downward pressure on risk. ", "Mark Declasit [ph] \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Right.  I mean, my gut reaction, which is not a legal one, is that you \u2013 I think you have a little bit more risk on the regulatory front, a little less risk on the contractual front with Westinghouse.  But I understand your characterization of what\u2019s happening. ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "And to follow Jimmy\u2019s comment, you know, a portion of the dollars identified we\u2019ll be spending from the contingency would be a risk treatment we paid to move of some these variable costs to the fixed categories.  We think that\u2019s good for us, we think that\u2019s good for customers and that we certainly are confident the Commission will look at that once they\u2019ve heard our testimony and the information we provide them to include that was proven.  So that would be another reason we feel confident of the recovery of those dollars.  ", "Mark Declasit [ph] \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Right.  And regarding Santee Cooper, you indicated that they might be interested in lowering their ownership interest.  What is the process by which that happens?  How is this interest exchanged from one party to the other?  Is it sold, is it \u2013 how does that happen? ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "It\u2019s covered by the terms of the agreement between us and Santee as part of our partnership arrangement.  The first step in the process would be for them to complete the evaluation of what they believe their needs will be long term, and then if they decide to reduce their level from the original estimated 45% which they signed up for, we would work with them to go through that process.  ", "Mark Declasit [ph] \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "And how would you identify another suitable party?  Do you have a right of refusal to a party that you may not deem creditworthy or do you have some say in the other party that could join you as a partner? ", "Kevin Marsh", "What I think is, as part of the agreement we would have to take that ownership change back to South Carolina Public Service Division for them to Review.  That was part of the base-load reorder.  We certainly had plenty of interest from other parties that have said they would like to talk to us if that time comes.  ", "Mark Declasit [ph] \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from the line of Jim VanRiceman with UBS.  Please proceed.  ", "Jim Van Riceman - UBS", "Good afternoon everyone.  ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "Hello, Jim. ", "Jim Van Riceman - UBS", "A couple questions, more modeling type.  If I look at your trailing 12 months earnings, there\u2019s 290 a share, and I know your guidance is 290 to 305.  The first question is, what \u2013 can you explain what would keep us down in that 290 range and then the second part of the question is obviously, what would get us up to the 305 range?  ", "And then the follow-up question.  How should we think about share counts for 2011 and 2012 given the delay in the forward pull down of shares?  Maybe talk a little bit more about effective cash rates and effective cost of debit if you would please. ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yeah, Jim, first of all, let me start with the second one, and you may have to remind me of the first one by the time I finish with this answer.  We\u2019re not going to be complete point specific about what we\u2019re modeling today, but we really believe with these tax rates in place, it will be late in 2011 before we\u2019ll need to take any of the additional shares down under the forward.  So we feel pretty good about not taking any of those down until the later part of 11.  Of course, you know, we\u2019re bringing down 90 to 100 million a year in our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) shares each year.  So effective tax rate, I think we still feel pretty good about it around 29% or so for our effective tax rate.  Debt levels, you know, the debt carrying cost, not a lot of volitility there because we have a very high percentage of our dept is in fixed rates.  Everything at the utility operating company is fixed and are all over long terms.  We\u2019ve not done anything over 5 or 10 years at the operating company and none of its variable other than just, you know, short-term commercial paper.  ", "Back to your first question about what might influence from one end of the range to the other.  Probably the largest volatile factor would be what happens in the balance of the year with the weather as it relates to Georgia.  So now with this weather normalization in electric, weather normalization in gas in South Carolina, utilization in Tracker in North Carolina, which wraps the weather inside of it.  The only thing we really have subject to weather is the Georgia business.  So the October through December months, the fourth quarter, if it\u2019s cold in that business, that\u2019s going to obviously help us move above the middle of the range or so.  And if it\u2019s very mild it would move us towards the lower end of the range.  That\u2019s our primary variable left here in the fourth quarter.  ", "Jim Van Riceman - UBS", "Is the grass still real green down there and you guys are playing golf? ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "We\u2019re not playing any golf, I promise you, not the last two weeks.  But it\u2019s mid-80s today, but it\u2019s supposed to be very cool by weekend, I think lows in the upper 30s.  ", "Jim Van Riceman - UBS", "Okay.  Thank you. ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "You\u2019re welcome. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ellinghaus with Wellington Shields.  Please proceed. ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Hey, everybody.  How are you? ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Good, Chris. ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "I believe \u2013 I think the in beginning, Jimmy, you were giving us some numbers on weather normalization impact and I didn\u2019t quite catch that.  Can you just go over that again?  ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yeah.  The \u2013 for the quarter it\u2019s about $0.12 per share for the residential and about $0.02 per share for the commercial.  So $0.14 in aggregate.  It was a very hot summer. ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Right.  Okay.  Can you also just review again for us how the variance process works in North Carolina?  ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "I\u2019m not sure I follow your, Chris. ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "You were saying that the weather is sort of \u2013 ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Oh, yeah, yeah.  The utilization tracker?  ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Right.  ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Sure.  It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s just a usage tracker that separates the rate from the utilization so that it\u2019s meant to \u2013 for any reason, if a customer uses less number of therms than the therms they used in the test year that the rates where set on, then it\u2019s adjusted.  It\u2019s deferred over a six-month period.  It\u2019s meant to encompass more efficient appliances, lower usage per customer so that the utility isn\u2019t constantly losing ground.  Once the Commission sets a rate, if a customer has put in more efficient appliances, tankless hot water heather, etcetera, then you\u2019re losing ground in making your margins that it takes to learn your allowed return.  So it really encompasses that efficiency and as well as any weather impacts. ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "But it should \u2013 what I\u2019m trying to get out is how efficient do you think it is in sort of separating out weather versus other sort of usage impacts that you can\u2019t necessarily define? ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Well, they\u2019re all wrapped in together, so we don\u2019t attempt to determine what part is due to weather or what part is due to less usage per appliance, but they\u2019re all wrapped in together so that we\u2019re made whole.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Maybe a better way to phrase it is you feel that mechanism is working effectively? ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "I do.  I really do.  It\u2019s a good mechanism for I think, all involved; for the customers, for the company and the Commission.  You know, to contrast it to the mechanism in South Carolina, we\u2019ve got the Annual rate stabilization Act and they have their pluses and minuses.  You know, the difference in South Carolina with the rate stabilization act is you pick up each year any new rate base.  Or in example of this most recent year, we depreciated more than we added so the customers got a small rate decrease.  The only way you turn that up in North Carolina is to have a rate case periodically every few years to pick up new rate base.  But the North Carolina mechanism, on the other hand, picks up just any efficiency that moves through the system, so it\u2019s positive from that standpoint.  ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay.  And lastly, I don\u2019t know, Kevin or Bill maybe, can you talk some more about the benefits that you\u2019re getting from the Chinese in terms of construction? ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "Yeah, as a matter of fact, I just got back from a trip a little over a month ago with Steve [inaudible] who heads up or Nuclear Group of our Generation, as well as Jeff Archy, who\u2019s our Chief Nuclear Officer.  We\u2019re getting a lot of benefit; one, just from first-hand view of the construction process, which generates questions in our minds about techniques or applications of the actual construction procedures.  We have a change to talk to their people first hand to understand what their problems are.  We\u2019ve had, you know, good information shared with us about how they take those lessons learned and implement them back into the engineering process through Westinghouse, which ultimately shows up in an improved product on our end when we start our construction.  So just from an overview perspective we get to see that first hand and talk to the people that are actually engaged in the process.  So those lessons learned are certainly helping us.  ", "We\u2019re also working with them to identify how we might be able to share information with the Chinese in terms of training and development of their staffs to run their nuclear plants.  And this is all \u2013 all one family.  We\u2019ve got all of these plants to operate successfully.  I believe from talking to their leadership teams, they\u2019re committed to making those plants run successfully and working with us and others that have significant experience in the nuclear industry to make sure that they all run as designed.  ", "So that day-to-day interaction, we talk with the Shaw and Westinghouse team that\u2019s over there on a daily basis to pull that information back to help us is all making our project more real for us.  I think the lesson I took away is I visited the plant for my first time and saw the actual construction coming out of the ground.  You know, the construction techniques that they\u2019re using, they\u2019ve got the modular assembly system where you put the module together and place those in the plant when they\u2019re ready for those.  A lot activity can take place at one time rather than just working on one particular area in the plant at a time.  Multiple activities are taking place and you can see that process does work.  They\u2019re on schedule with putting those modules in place.  So the realization for me is that this new construction methodology is in fact working, which eliminates one of the biggest concerns we\u2019ve got of any potential delays or over runs as we get into that process.  ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "And in addition to the benefits that you guys have been getting from the recession on the escalation costs, have you done any sort of analysis or any thoughts on how this Chinese relationship is going to end up affecting your cost expectations? ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "You know, in terms of trying to lower the cost, I don\u2019t see what we\u2019re going to learn there, it\u2019s going to lower the cost we expect to spend \u2013 ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "I\u2019m just thinking in terms of avoidance of some of the problems that the Chinese has experienced, you know, is that going to end up affecting your escalation; your initial expectations for escalation maybe? ", "Kevin Marsh", "", "No, I think it just gives us more confidence that the numbers we have are accurate and we can deliver the project within the estimated cost that we present to the commission.  You know, all of the lessons learned, whether it\u2019s an engineering issue or when they actually go through to construction or placing these units together, it\u2019s gathered and shared with all of the parties and we\u2019ve already made some changes in terms of our construction plans based on what we\u2019ve seen.  For example, when they started their initial construction, assembling the modules, all of that was done outside.  We decided from a climate perspective, we built the building on site that will accommodate construction of those modules inside so we can continue to work when it\u2019s raining and we have inclement weather.  That will help us stay on schedule in terms of the timing of the work that needs to be done.  ", "The position of some of the modules that are being constructed, they had some that they put together horizontally, then they had to right those and that put some stresses on some of the welds as a result.  We\u2019ll be completing our modules in the upright, vertical position so we don\u2019t have to do those lifts that could put some stress on the welds in the project.  ", "So all of those things that we learned, some are bigger than others, but combined together, it just gives us a higher degree of confidence that the plan we\u2019ve got can be executed within the budget as long as we present it to the Commission. ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Great.  Thanks a lot for the color.  I appreciate it. ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "And the timeframe, I would add.

Our financing strategy is proceeding very well with the successful execution of the forward, the implementation of the tax gratitude and the completion of the expanded credit facility.  We have successfully completed our retail electric rate case in South Carolina.  In addition, our new nuclear project is proceeding on schedule with the BLRA functioning exactly as designed.

Thank you for standing by. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Claims and Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Byron Hinson", "Thank you. I would like to welcome everyone to our earning\u2019s conference call including those who are joining us on the web cast.", "As you know, earlier today we announced the financial results for Q1 2011. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison \u2013 SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Marsh \u2013 President of SCANA, and Steve Byrne \u2013 Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. We will review those results and then we\u2019ll start answering your questions.", "The slides and the earnings release that we\u2019ll refer to in this call are available at www.scana.com. (inaudible) Virginia, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made in today\u2019s call which are not statements of historical fact are considered forward looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which are shown on slide two and discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks Byron. Good afternoon. I would like to welcome each of you to our call also. Let\u2019s start on slide three which reflects SCANA\u2019s 2011 Q1 basic earnings per share of $1 compared to $1.02 per share in 2010. The decline in earnings was primarily attributable to weather in our Georgia market of natural gas rates stabilization act, decrease in South Carolina, higher depreciation and share dilution; all of which offset improved margins from electric based rate increases. We are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guide of $2.95 to $3.10 per share with an internal target of $3.02.", "Additionally, with more than 90% of our earnings weather normalized I thought it might be helpful for you to understand our view of our annual earnings plan by quarter. In our annual forecast we see this distribution as approximately 30% in both Q1 and Q4, 25% in Q3 and the remaining 15% in Q2. Hopefully this will be helpful in the quarterly distribution within your models. I caution you to consider the combination of this quarterly distribution and our annual guidance in updating your models if you choose to use it at all.", "Now on slide four I\u2019d like to review results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G\u2019s Q1 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $.04 compared to 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the base load review act and the mid-2010 retail electric rate case offset the lower gas margins from the RSA rate decrease and the higher capital related costs of depreciation, property taxes and interest.", "As you may recall, in Q1 of 2010, we deferred for refund $25 million related to incremental margin from unusually cold weather as part of the implementation of our pilot electric weather normalization mechanism. This program applies to residential and commercial electric customers and was fully implemented in August 2010. The 2010 deferral had the effect of weather normalizing Q1, therefore there is no weather variance at the SCE&G.", "At March 31, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 663,000 electric customers and approximately 315,000 natural gas customers; up .6% and .9% respectively over the same date in 2010.", "PS&C Energy\u2019s earnings for Q1 2011, in red, were $.25 per share unchanged from Q1 of 2010. Increases in margin from customer growth of 1.4% were offset by higher interest expense. As with SCE&G, no wonder variance is seen at PS&C due to the customer usage tracker or decoupling mechanism. SCANA Energy in grain reported earnings of $.17 during the quarter compared to $.24 in the prior year. The $.07 per share decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to weather. The colder than normal weather in Q1 2010 contributed $.09 to earnings as compared to about $.02 from colder than normal weather in 2011. Said another way, although Q1 of 2011 was cold, it was not nearly as cold as Q1 of 2010.", "SCANA Energy was serving approximately 460,000 customers as of March 31, 2011. SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $.03 per share in Q1 of 2011 compared to $.02 per share in the same quarter last year.", "Slide five shows our electric and gas sales statistics. Unit sales of electricity and natural gas to our retail customers in Q1 of 2011 were down over the prior year driven by weather related decreases in our residential and commercial classes. Of course our WNA and CUT mechanisms normalized margin and not unit sales. The industrial sector continued the train of recovery with an increase in both electric and gas sales.", "On slide six you can see an update of economic growth announcements during Q1 of 2011. These recent announcements suggest the creation of more than 1800 new jobs with an investment of more than $600 million and are a continuing sign of a longer-term economic recovery in our service territory.", "As you can see on slide seven, we expect to complete our debt financings for 2011 next month. As it relates to our cash position the final ROS rules for 2011 bonus depreciation were issued in March. These final rules are consistent with the method we used to originally estimate cash will be generated from bonus depreciation as discussed during our February call. In addition to bonus depreciation we continue to recognize a cash benefit and the method being used to account for capital maintenance, which results in certain maintenance costs being treated as current expenses for income tax purposes. Combined, we expect these strategies to generate over $60 million in cash benefit. Accordingly, we do not expect to draw the remaining funds under our May 2010 equity forward until early 2012, which will mitigate dilution.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks Jimmy. I would like to direct your attention first to slide 8. As most of you are aware, the United States environmental protection agency issued a proposed rule on March 16th, 2011 which would provide the first national standards for emissions of mercury, arsenic and other pollutants from coal and oil fired power plants. We will review the proposed rules to better understand any potential impact on our operations. The proposed rule must first be published under federal register, then undergo a 60-day comment period and the EPA will also hold three public meetings. Based upon the comments received, the EPA may make changes to the proposal before it is finalized, as early as November 6th, 2011. SCANA is committed to being a good steward of the environment and to meeting all the requirements set by state and federal regulators regarding power plant emissions. After the final rule is available, we will develop a compliant strategy based on the requirements of the rule, compliant time frames and the estimated cost of various options for compliance.", "Since the mid 1990s we have spent nearly a billion dollars installing environmental equipment in our fossil plants including, most recently, an SER at our Coat facility and (inaudible) and William Station plants. That equipment has significantly reduced emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and mercury on our system.", "Let me turn now to our new nuclear project activities. On slide nine I\u2019m very pleased to report that our project for two new units remains on budget and on schedule for 2016 and 2019 respectively. As you may recall, on November 15th, 2010, we filed a petition with the South Carolina Public Service Commission seeking approval to update the capital cost schedules for the construction of the company\u2019s new nuclear units. This filing was necessary due to the decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court last year, which found that general contingency costs should not be included in forecast approved under the Base Load Review Act. Instead, as the proposed use contingency fund is identified and itemized in specific cost categories, we must file with the PSC for approval.", "The November 2010 filing identified and itemized certain capital costs of approximately $174 million that will be incurred during the construction of the new nuclear unit. These are not additional costs nor is this an additional quest to raise customer rates. We\u2019re simply specifying how we intend to use some of the dollars that were originally included in the contingency fund in our initial BLRA filing now that we have more clarity of the construction outlook. The hearing on this request was held on April 4th and we anticipate receiving permission order in May. After receiving the order, any approved capital costs already incurred will be added to those included in our revised rates filing under BLRA to determine the requested rate adjustment for 2011.", "Please turn to slide ten. On February 14, 2011 we filed our quarterly status report with the CFC and the Office Of Regulatory Staff for Q4 of 2010 as required under our Base Load Review order. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website. Additionally, we intend to file our quarterly status report for Q1 2011 on Monday, May 16th and our annual request for revised rate under the Base Load Review Act on Friday, May 27th. The remaining dates on this slide represent other regulatory filings we anticipate making later this year. We are pleased with the progress of the projects and the continued regulatory support that we have received.", "We believe that nuclear power is a clean non-invading source of energy, which will position South Carolina well in the future, particularly as environmental regulations surrounding greenhouse gases and coal increase.", "I will now turn the call over to Steve Byrne who will discuss our COL application and provide and update on the status of our nuclear construction project.", "Steve Byrne", "Thank you Kevin. Please turn to slide 11. The nuclear regulatory commissions\u2019 licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. We continue to anticipate receiving our combined operating license or COL in late 2011 or early 2012. The COL during impact study referenced in the most recent BLRA filing was initiated by SCE&G in December of 2010. This detailed study is an evaluation of the alternatives for optimizing the construction schedule to make up the anticipated delay beyond the original construction schedule for the first under the EPC contract which assumed the COL would be issued in mid-2011 rather than our current expectation.", "Construction schedules generally can be adjusted by adding shifts of construction workers working weekends, undertaking scopes of work in parallel instead of in series and similar changes in the construction plan. SCE&G is involved in the ongoing oversight of the study and will review the results and any cost associated with compressing the schedule using such techniques. While the situation is dynamic, we anticipate that this study will be completed by the end of Q2. SCE&G continues to believe that the commercial operation date for the first will fall within the schedule approved by the South Carolina Public Service Commission including the allowable schedule contingencies. There should be no adverse impact on the commercial operation date for the second meeting.", "In late 2010 the NRC staff completed its technical review of the current AP1000 design for the shield building as well as other design changes proposed by Westinghouse and issued a favorable comprehensive advanced safety evaluation report for the units. The advisory committee on reactive safeguards, an independent panel of advisors in NRC also reviewed and recommended the AP1000 design and related changes and has determined that the current design is fully adequate to protect the public health and safety.", "We received our final environmental impact statement last week and we anticipate receiving the final safety evaluation report this summer. We believe the NRC will conduct a mandatory hearing in the fall this year. I\u2019d like to point out that there will be no contested hearing as all interveners challenges to SCE&G COL application have been denied by both the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. After mandatory hearing is complete, the NRC will make the decision regarding issuance of our COL.", "As you see from the aerial photo on slide 12, we continue to proceed with pre-construction activity to the site and continue to receive parts on site in preparation for constructing. After we receive the COL, we will begin so called Nuclear Construction of the unit. I\u2019d like to point out that while we do not foresee a delay on the COL beyond late 2011 or early 2012, we are evaluating contingency plans for that scenario. There\u2019s a great deal of work that can be done on the unit prior to receipt of the COL. For example, the two largest modules, CA01 and CA20 can be constructed simultaneously in the module assembly building and then moved into the excavation site once we receive the COL. In the unlikely event that we might receive the COL in late 2011 or early 2012 as we expect, we feel confident that we will be able to optimize our construction schedule for critical path items to reduce any significant impact to our in-service dates.", "Finally I would like to briefly touch on the supply chain. As you may know, our turbine generators and steel plating for the containment vessels are being manufactured in Japan. While these components represent less than 15% of the total project cost, they are long lead-time components. Our suppliers in Japan have assured us that they suffered minimal damage as a result of the natural disaster. The biggest challenge these suppliers continue to face is related to their electric power supply. Japan continues to have rolling blackouts so they are not able to operate at full capacity. However, we do not anticipate significant delays in our construction due to these supply issues.", "That concludes our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions.) And our first question comes from the line of Ashar Karaun from VISSIM. Please proceed.", "Ashar Karaun \u2013 VISSIM", "Hey, sorry I joined a little bit late. Did you mention if you weather normalize, what was the customer usage this Q1 versus last year\u2019s Q1?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well other than our Georgia operations, of course our margins are weather normalized for financial purposes. So there is no difference in the earnings in any of the regulated companies from Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year other than Georgia.", "Ashar Karaun \u2013 VISSIM", "No I understand that but I was trying to see is customer usage flat or is going down? On a trend basis?", "Kevin Marsh", "It\u2019s neither. It\u2019s actually increasing. So if you look at customer usage on a weather normalized basis, it\u2019s approximately 1.5% higher than it was in the same quarter of the prior year.", "Ashar Karaun \u2013 VISSIM", "Okay thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Erica Piserchia representing Wunderlich Securities. Please proceed.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich", "Hi guys. Just a quick follow up. Ashar circled in on one of the questions I had just with regards to that comment on usage. Any particular trends, you know, is that more on the residential side or is that kind of across the board as far as usage comparisons with last year?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well I\u2019d say if it\u2019s more attributable to any sector it would be industrials. You can see in the information we disclosed in the back of the press release that industrials were up almost 5% year-over-year. And last year was the first quarter that we saw significant increase from 2009\u2019s first quarter in the industrial sales. So we\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019re continuing to see growth over the growth of 2010 in the industrial category. So I\u2019d say the majority of it is in the industrial category.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, we\u2019ve seen a lot of job announcements we\u2019ve got more detailed in our slides here today. We\u2019ve had more for you in the past there. But we still have to see many of those announcements translate into more jobs which I think ultimately translates into more residential commercial usage.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich", "Okay. So it sounds like residential commercial then is relatively flat or would that have been, you know, down?", "Kevin Marsh", "No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s down. I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t have the details in front of me Erica but I would say it\u2019s probably more flat. Of course we have more customers but so kind of the same customer year-over-year I\u2019d say it\u2019s relatively flat.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich", "Okay. And then just two quick questions on the nuclear. First, I guess just a process question; I guess the last I had heard was that the NRC hearing with regard to the COL process was expected for midsummer and I think you expected you\u2019re now expecting it in fall. Any particular reason for that sort of date change or can you give any color on that?", "Steve Byrne", "Well, this is Steve. The change from summer to fall really is within the NRC\u2019s allowable variance in their process. So it still could happen in late summer. I\u2019m not sure that we ever said midsummer but it still could happen in late summer but more than likely our anticipation is that it will be this fall.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich", "Okay. And then just a last question and I understand this is maybe one step further but just wondering if you can provide what your understanding is of where things stand with regard to the design certification process between Westinghouse and the NRC.", "Steve Byrne", "Sure. Westinghouse has undergone a number of revisions to their certified design, you know, they were originally certified back in early 2006. Since that timeframe they\u2019ve had three revisions pending before the nuclear regulatory commission. The rule for that change in the design or the change in the certified design has been out for comment for some period of time and I think the comments are due May the 10th and at the same time what Westinghouse is working on is a conforming revision to their DCDs. That will be submitted in the form of DCD rev 19. Now the exact date for submission of rev 19, I don\u2019t know today. It should be fairly soon but the definition of soon could be sometime in May or possibly stretching into June. I\u2019m really not sure. But there will be a conforming DCD revision 19.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Marc de Croisset representing FBM Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Marc de Croisset \u2013 FBM Capital Markets", "Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you refresh my memory on what happens mechanically to cost recovery in the event there\u2019s a slippage in construction timeframe for the nuclear plants or if there\u2019s a later service date. Are there allowanced for extraordinary events for example such as the failure of a supplier to meet its obligations. Could you provide us a little color on that?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah. This is Kevin. When we filed the base load re-filing back in 2008 and requested approval for that, the commission granted us an 18-month extension to the expected in-service date to account for any slippage in the schedule. That would be a time delay allowance. Anytime we might go over the cost that was approved by the commission in that filing with the capital costs schedules as we refer to those and are described in the quarterly report, if we exceed that cost or we expect to exceed that cost, we would have to go back to the commission to get approval for recovery of the additional cost which would give us the opportunity to put the reasons for that cost increase on the board with them and let them have a chance to ask us questions and evaluate that and make a decision. And under the assumption that those would be prudently incurred costs they would include that in the capital cost schedules on a go-forward basis.", "Marc de Croisset \u2013 FBM Capital Markets", "So timing enough of, it sounds like you have an 18-month buffer with respect to timing of construction. Is that correct?", "Kevin Marsh", "That\u2019s correct. They allowed us to go out 18 months. We gave them a milestone schedule as part of that process and we can extend those milestones 18 months or accelerate them 24 months under that approved order.", "Marc de Croisset \u2013 FBM Capital Markets", "As a follow-up I\u2019m wondering if I guess on a related question if you had any further thoughts on lessons learned from Fukushima Daiichi.", "Steve Byrne", "This is Steve. I guess I\u2019ll take that. First let me tell you that I think that it\u2019s probably a little early for us to start talking about the lessons learned. The nuclear regulatory commission has, in process, a lessons learned review that they\u2019ll be reporting out and it\u2019s a 90 day review and they\u2019ll be reporting out at 30, 60 and 90 days. And I think May 12th is the advertised date for that first report out from that 30-day review. Beyond that what the NRC is doing is they\u2019re putting in place a taskforce to do a more in-depth review and that taskforce, I believe it\u2019s been selected, once it starts its work it\u2019s about a six month working time frame. So I think that will probably put us somewhere near the end of this year. And that taskforce will then report out. So the NRC has a couple lessons learned of things in the work.", "What we are doing is in the United States after September 11th of 2001, we put in place a number of practices, procedures and equipment to compensate for loss of large areas of the plant. And it really doesn\u2019t make much difference as to what the reason for that loss is whether it\u2019s an aircraft impact, whether it\u2019s a tornado, hurricane, whatever the reason is. We had to have mitigating strategies and then some equipment staged. Not necessarily staged at the plant location but staged so that you can get it to the plant location as soon as the plant location suffers some damage.", "So one of the things we\u2019ve done after the Fukushima accident was we verified all the equipment was in place and verify that all of our practices and procedures will work. We did that through a group we belong to called WANO Nuclear Power Operations. That group subsequently is one of the charter members of a world association of nuclear operators. But the Japanese utilities are members of that world association and they will be reporting out on lessons learned through that group, through WANO and we\u2019ll get our information through the info link into WANO. Though there\u2019s a couple of, one national and one worldwide industry of associations that will be formulating those lessons learned. Now based on what we have seen, I want to point out a couple things. One, the type of reactors that they\u2019re using in Japan at that Fukushima site, all six of their reactors were borne water reactors. The reactors that we are building and the reactors we currently operate are pressurized water reactors. So there is a fundamental difference in the way that the reactors operate.", "Secondly their issue really was not caused as much by the earthquake as it was by the tsunami. They had a significant wall of water that impacted that facility. Our information, in fact, is that the plants rode through the earthquake pretty well; all the reactors shut down, all the controls rods fully inserted, the reactors went sub-critical, the diesel generator started to carry the emergency loads and it wasn\u2019t until almost an hour later when the tsunami flooded the facility that they lost that onsite power supply and then they were relying just on the battery. Our facility is over 400 feet above sea level and we\u2019re over 100 miles from the ocean. So the tsunami issue for us will not be an issue.", "So there are some fundamental differences we\u2019ve looked into. What we do expect to learn are things like communications, batteries, emergency planning, communication to offsite agencies, that didn\u2019t go probably as smoothly as it could have or should have. But one fundamental difference is that I don\u2019t think the rest of the world took the events of September 11th of 2001 as seriously as the United States did, probably for very good reasons. But in the US we put in place beyond our design basis mitigating strategies at that point in time. But most of the rest of the world probably didn\u2019t pay a lot of attention to it.", "Marc de Croisset \u2013 FBM Capital Markets", "That\u2019s terrific. Thank you very much for that explanation.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yeah guys, really two questions, one bigger picture. Can you talk about when you\u2019ll get a little more certainty from your suppliers in Japan about whether there are timeline delays caused by some of the rolling blackouts? I mean do they give that to you on a weekly, on a monthly basis, how often do they check in with you to give you an update on where they are in the process.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah sure. They are checking in through our consortia because their contracts in general are with the consortia members. So largely for the Japanese vendors that would be through Westinghouse. They are checking with Westinghouse on a weekly or more frequent basis. And remember that one of the suppliers is actually the parent company for Westinghouse and that\u2019s Toshiba and that\u2019s probably our largest supplier in Japan. And again they have not indicated to us any significant damage. In fact none of the vendors that we\u2019re using whether it\u2019s Toshiba, IJI or some of their sub vendors, has indicated to us that they\u2019ve suffered any amount of real damage from the earthquake or tsunami. We did have some equipment on the ground, plate steel and that kind of thing and we verified that our equipment has not suffered any damage.", "Now their rolling blackout situation is getting better. And as much as it is now more predictable then it used to be and a number of vendors have indicated to us that they are now shifting their work schedules such that if power\u2019s not going to be available during the day but it will be available at night , then they\u2019re bringing folks in at night to do the work. So as of right now we\u2019re not anticipating any real delays from the supply chain in Japan.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Thank you. And Jimmy, one question just on the quarter a little bit. If I take the total or EPS contribution that comes from what looks like it\u2019s basically corporate and other, and I back out the cost of holding company debt, you\u2019ve got a nice little contribution from kind of some of the other items. Could you just kind of walk us through what those are?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. The principal item in there, Michael, would probably be our intrastate pipeline company, CGT. So that\u2019s, on an annual basis, probably contributes $.07 or $.08 something like that in earnings on an annual basis. And then our gas marketing business, maybe $.02 or $.03 on manual basis from it. So those are the most significant.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. So CGT and (inaudible) combined roughly $.09 or $.10 total on an annualized level.", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s right.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you. Much appreciated.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann representing UBS. Please proceed.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Good afternoon everyone. Three quick questions; all just nuance type stuff. The first one is on O&M trends. O&M was down in Q1, can you talk about some of the O&M trends especially in light of the comments you made in conjunction with the Q4 earnings call?", "Second question is at SCE&G what was the earned ROE for either the trailing 12 or 13 months, I forgot how you report it.", "And then the final question is on your funding and cash flow impacts and needs going forward on bonus depreciation, I think you mentioned it, but the cash impacts on both 11 and 12 especially now that the rules are out and what are you thinking about your DRIP program in the next several years?", "Kevin Marsh", "Okay, yeah, thanks Jim. On the first, on O&M, we do continue to keep tight control around what we call core O&M. That\u2019s the things that are really controllable by the wine businesses. The things that have been, and those are really, we\u2019ve maintained those relatively flat. The one exception to that is that for the first time in three years we did have salary increases during Q1 that was impacted about half of the quarter for mid-February. Very modest amounts of 2% to 2.5%, something like that. So you want to have a full run of that for a quarter until Q2.", "The things that are offset that many of our incentive comp plans, the part driven by shareholder return, the costs of the revision in the long-term guidance that we did on the yearend call and because of the hit the stock took with the Japan crisis initially. We were out of the money on those at the end of the quarter. So there\u2019s no incentive cost in there related to the shareholder return for Q1.", "And the third thing I\u2019d comment on about O&M really relates to bad debt expense. And we continue to have fairly good success in a very difficult economy with bad debt expense across the companies. Certainly low natural gas prices have helped that. A milder winter compared to a winter ago has kept total bills down, has helped that as well. And I think generally just people\u2019s pulling back and concentrating on more critical items in the household they\u2019ve maybe moved the utility bill up in the priority compared to some things they would have spent on a couple three years ago. So we\u2019re fairly encouraged about that but we\u2019re going to watch that throughout the balance of the year so it\u2019s kind of cautious optimism.", "On the ROEs you asked about, on the electric business we continue to be at about 10%, just slightly under .995% but that is on a proforma basis and I would just caution you that, so what we do, as you\u2019re probably familiar, is we annualize expenses. I gave you a moment ago the example of salary increases. So in that 10% return that we filed with the regulators, we\u2019ll take any expenses what we\u2019re aware of and known and measurable at the time and annualize a full year\u2019s run rate. So that usually results in a 20 to 40 basis point reduction off the actual return. So when I give you slightly under 10%, the actual return for the period may have been closer to 20 to 40 basis points higher. We try to proforma the entire everything we know of at that point in time out in accordance with the regulator\u2019s requirements.", "And then the last thing I think you asked about cash flow and overall with the change we made in our capitalization policy and then the bonus depreciation on top of that, we estimate in aggregate over $200 million of additional cash over those two plus years, really a part of \u201810, \u201811 and \u201812 that would benefit us. Therefore we don\u2019t see ourselves taking down any of the remaining forward equity until Q1 of 2012 when we had originally projected to take that down in a few trenches during this year. So we think we\u2019re in much better position there from a cash basis and we don\u2019t really see needing any additional equity beyond that in the equity forward until well into 2012.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "So does that imply that you\u2019re not going to do the DRIP program either for the next couple years or next year or so?", "Kevin Marsh", "Oh sorry. No, we will continue to run the reinvestment, the shares from the dividend reinvestment as well as the 401k plan and that we\u2019re going to write about $100 million a year.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Super. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Greg Wright representing (inaudible). Please proceed.", "Greg Wright", "Hi guys. I saw that you guys mentioned that you were evaluating contingency plans in case the COL license is delayed and you guys were not expecting any sort of impact on the in-service dates of the units. Just wanted to get a little bit more detail on the 2012 nuclear CAPEX. If there were some sort of slippage in the COL timeline would you guys anticipate any of that CAPEX being delayed?", "Kevin Marsh", "I think the short answer is we probably would anticipate some of that being delayed. But that would be in the, what I termed, the so-called nuclear construction because there are some things that I need a license in order to start. But there are a significant amount of activities that we currently have ongoing that do not need the license and would continue. Cooling towers for example, we just started on cooling towers. We\u2019d be able to step our way through those. There\u2019s one permit we\u2019re waiting on for the cooling towers but was dependent on us getting the final environmental impact statement. Well we received that final environmental impact statement a little over a week ago so we should be cleared to do that now.", "We can start the fabrication of the modules; these are the big modules that eventually will be put in the excavation. We\u2019ve got probably a year plus worth of work on the two biggest ones and we can stage those and start on some of the smaller modules. The plate for the containment vessel bottom bowl, the way you build a containment vessel is it\u2019s almost two inch thick steel and you build a bottom bowl just a layer that looks like a big cereal bowl, then you build some stackable rings and then you build the top portion of the bowl. We received all the plate for the bottom bowl and we\u2019ve got probably a years\u2019 worth of fabrication on site to do that. And then we\u2019ll start receiving plate for the ring sites and that can all continue.", "We\u2019ve got the switchyard that we\u2019re constructing. That will go through, probably through about 2012. We\u2019ve got a water treatment facility that eventually will supply all three of our units. That can continue and we\u2019ve got a number of other support, piping, intake, structure, discharge, well water supply, all those kinds of things you can go in.", "So we\u2019ve got a reasonably significant amount of work that will continue even if we did not get the COL when we anticipate it, you know, we would be looking at reconfiguring our critical path schedule and looking to see what kinds of things we can do external to the excavation that might be inserted once finished. For example rebar; if we put the reinforcing bar together, the matrix and the lattice together outside of the excavation and then lowered it in later, that would remove that from critical pass. So while we would anticipate that the capital spending would slow down in 2012, we would not certainly anticipate a cessation and it would be a reasonable significant amount that we can continue to do.", "Greg Wright", "Got it. And of that $832 million you guys have slated for 2012, how much is related to the construction CAPEX that you had mentioned that requires the actual COL?", "Kevin Marsh", "I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever broken it down into COL required construction CAPEX. So that may be a number we\u2019d have to work on.", "Greg Wright", "Okay, but you guys would be able to, I guess, backfill some of that potential with these other items that you had just mentioned.", "Kevin Marsh", "Oh yeah, certainly.", "Greg Wright", "Got it. All right, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Chris Ellinghaus representing Wellington Shields. Please proceed.", "Christopher Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Hey everybody, how are you? Steve can you, I think you described pretty well that you don\u2019t expect Japan to be a problem in terms of deliveries but is there any critical path items that you might be able to tell us when that delivery date might be just so we can get a further sense of how much time we have to catch up?", "Steve Byrne", "Well off the top of my head what we\u2019re looking at is our first critical path large items actually are not coming from Japan. They\u2019re coming from South Korea, so they were Union-impacted. And we actually opted to have most of our large forgings or ultra large forgings not done in Japan. Currently their situation is still but there are only two places in the world where ultra large forgings can be done and that\u2019s either in Japan or in Korea. And we opted to have ours done in Korea. So the forgings and the machining are all being done in Korea before shipment here.", "We have plate steel that we are going to need for the first ring. It should be coming from a company called IHI, that\u2019s the in Tokyo area. And again we\u2019ve contacted them and don\u2019t anticipate any delays but we would expect to receive some of that steel in 2012 such that when we\u2019re finished with the lower bowl we can start, actually we\u2019ll start before hand, we\u2019ll start on the first lane. So the little bowl goes in first and then the first ring will go on after that. So we would expect those deliveries in 2012 from IHI in the Tokyo area.", "The turbine generator is a (inaudible) item but that wasn\u2019t slated to start I think until sometime in \u201812 so we\u2019re not going to receive that until probably sometime in \u201813 or \u201814.", "Christopher Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay super. Have you got any color for us in terms of DOE, long guarantees and what you\u2019re testing?", "Kevin Marsh", "I can add the color on that. This is Kevin. We have been participating in the loan guarantee process, going through the due diligence and have gotten to a point where we believe we provided enough information to their team that will allow us to get some sort of information back on what sort of terms and conditions they might be attaching to the loan guarantees.", "We know and it\u2019s been reported they\u2019ve got a deal with Southern on the Georgia projects. We\u2019d like to certainly see how those documents are laid out and what the requirements might be in there to make sure it would be something that would fit with us for the long-term period that those loans would run. They present some challenges from a financing perspective because they\u2019re twenty-year amortizing loans, which means in that twenty-year period you\u2019ll be out of the marketplace, refinancing significant parts of the plant. If you do accept the loan guarantees that gives us some concern with interest rates where they are today given that they\u2019re likely to go up. That could expose us to some fairly good-sized risk as opposed to thirty-year bonds that we typically do under our First Mortgage financing.", "So we have told DOE that we need some more information before we go any further to evaluate the loans but I would reaffirm that we\u2019ve said since day one we don\u2019t need the loan guarantees to proceed with the project. We\u2019ve been very successful to date in doing the financing we need to bring the debt on board as necessary and that we certainly believe that will continue to be the case. So we\u2019ll continue to work with them as information becomes available. But at this point I would say the ball is in their court to provide us additional information to help us do the evaluation; in the meantime we\u2019ll continue with our First Mortgage-run debt issuances when they are necessary.", "Christopher Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay, great. Jimmy, there was, I appreciate you gave some color in terms of the way you see your quarterly earnings pattern developing. The Q4 surprised, the sort of imputed Q4 on the midpoint of your guidance seems a little surprising to me. Can you maybe provide some color on things that you see in the Q4 that might lead to what seems to be a significant year-over-year increase?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, yeah, I mean you\u2019re going to have- We\u2019ve got two or three things going on that could impact it. One, we\u2019ve got a, last year was an abnormal year for the RSA at SCE&G Gas because we had a decrease \u2013 the first time we\u2019ve had a decrease since we\u2019ve had that mechanism. I don\u2019t expect that to be the case this year. I expect to see a modest increase this year so you\u2019ve really got that going in opposite directions \u2013 that kind of exacerbates the difference. We\u2019ve got a rate proceeding at our interstate pipeline company, CGT that I mentioned earlier in response to a question, and I think those new rates will be in effect by that time so we\u2019ll have some benefit coming in from that as well.", "And then you\u2019ve just got year-over-year continued improvement that we\u2019ve seen in the industrial sector as well in addition to R&C additions in all of our businesses. So I think most of those main, top line factors are positives, and we continue to do a pretty good job maintaining expense controls. So I think most of the changes are benefits on a year-over-year basis.", "Christopher Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay, great. And then one final thing \u2013 can you just remind us, and I am inferring from what you said that if you don\u2019t take down any of the Forward sale this year at all that you\u2019d take it all down in the Q1 next year? What would that bring you to for your total for 2012 equity including your normal plans?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, the balance in the Forward at the time we executed the deal was about $240 million, but because we\u2019ve issued those under the Forward, you know, we\u2019re not paying the dividends each quarter. The underwriters pay those to the holders of the shares. So the net proceeds decrease every time there\u2019s a quarterly dividend and those are paid by the underwriter rather than us. So if we hold those until the end of Q1 in 2012 the $240 million would be more like maybe $210 million or $215 million net proceeds, in addition to the approximately $100 million through the (inaudible) plans.", "Christopher Ellinghaus \u2013 Wellington Shields", "Okay, great. Thanks so much, I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins, representing State of Wisconsin Investments. Please proceed.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Kevin Marsh", "Good afternoon.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "First, I just want to clarify your response to Char on whether normalized sales growth at electric, you said it was 1.5 \u2013 is that total sales or total retail sales?", "Kevin Marsh", "Total, total retail.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Total retail?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. And then somewhat related to that I saw the Q1 your wholesale was up 11.1%. Was that just opportunity sales or do you have some new contracts on the wholesale area, or what drove\u2013", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, it\u2019s not a new contract. It\u2019s just energy sales to one significant customer we have, the North Carolina EMC\u2019s, and it\u2019s really, it\u2019s 10%, 11% but last year\u2019s quarter, there\u2019s so little going on in that arena these days with the recession, a small change looks like a significant amount but it\u2019s not a large amount. But it\u2019s not any new contracts.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. And then I was curious if you\u2019d give us a little more color on the $0.16 electric margin variance as to how much of that\u2019s related to the base mode review increases, and if there\u2019s any related just you know, normal sales growth and so forth?", "Kevin Marsh", "Right, I would say about $0.06 of the $0.16 is related to the base load review. The most significant amount is related to the base rate increase that was effective mid of August last year, so this is the first time that Q1 has had that base rate increase in it. And then there\u2019s some in there for base customer growth but I would say that\u2019s a minimal amount, maybe a half cent, something like that.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. And then I was wondering if you could give me what the CAPEX was for the Q1?", "Jimmy Addison", "Dan, I don\u2019t have the actual CAPEX at my fingertips here but we\u2019d be glad to provide that prospectively if it\u2019ll be of some assistance to you. I can tell you that we\u2019re not, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re significantly off our plan.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. How about cash flow from operations? Would that be the same answer?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, I really don\u2019t have that. We\u2019ll file our Q next week and you\u2019ll have that information in the Q next Wednesday I believe.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay. And then the last thing I had questions on was on your slide #10 you kind of showed the regulatory update related to the upcoming base load review filing. And last year\u2019s was about double the year before; how should we think about this year\u2019s in comparison to the prior year? Is it about similar size or will it continue to increase?", "Kevin Marsh", "This is Kevin. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll change significantly from last year. We have not determined that final number. It\u2019ll be based on the expenditures that are available at the time that filing is made. If you go back and look at the schedules in the quarter before and the schedules for the base load review filing it gives you an estimate by year of how much we expect to be spending. And we should be pretty close to those numbers and we\u2019ll finalize that when the filing is made.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investments", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Erica Piserchia, representing Wunderlich Securities. Please proceed.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Hi, just two quick follow-up questions. First, kind of getting back to what Greg was asking about, you mentioned in your comments that you could absorb a delay in the COL issuance by moving things around in 2012. Can you give us a sense of sort of what point during the year past which you would have to start shifting CAPEX into 2013? You mentioned you can absorb a delay in early 2012 but I would imagine you probably can\u2019t if a COL was delayed materially beyond, I don\u2019t know, the middle of the year. Just trying to get a better sense of sort of where the strain or the sensitivity is to that ability to shift things around a little bit from a timing perspective.", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah, I think the short answer is it would depend on how long any potential delay would be at the time when we were made aware of it, but we would probably start to reconfigure schedules and CAPEX if it became obvious to us that we were not going to get the license by about the first of the year. But if they came back and said it was going to be a week\u2019s delay obviously that wouldn\u2019t be significant; if they said it was three months\u2019 or six months\u2019 then we would begin to do a reevaluation of what we\u2019re going to do and in what sequence we\u2019re going to do it. And that would then facilitate the capital expenditure changes.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, so it seems that putting that together with your comment that early 2012 is sort of the (inaudible) on that, we\u2019d be looking at delays maybe beyond the middle of the year or something that would cause some material reorganization of those activities relative to what you could do if it was just a matter of a couple weeks or a month or something like that.", "Steve Byrne", "Certainly if it was a matter of just a couple weeks it wouldn\u2019t be a huge impact to us. What we\u2019re trying to do is balance the amount of resources that we\u2019ve got on the site along with the equipment and the work we\u2019ve got for them to do. So we want to try to keep as many people actively engaged as we can to avoid taking folks that we have already trained and allowing them to go home, and then run the risk that they may not come back when we\u2019re ready to recall them. So we\u2019re going to balance that, we\u2019re doing that now in fact.", "We\u2019re looking at what our resource leads need to be and what they need to look like. So if it\u2019s going to be significantly beyond when we expect it that could have an impact, but we have continued to say \u2013 I think we\u2019ve been saying for about two years now \u2013 that we expect to see it around late 2011, early 2012, and as of right now we don\u2019t know anything to say that\u2019s anything different.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, okay. And then my last question is just actually, I forgot to ask this earlier, but just thinking back to your advised earnings growth target of 3% to 5% that you pointed out, is there a way you can kind of give us a better sense of what that implies for the underlying growth in the base, the utility base business kind of excluding the nuclear angle?", "Kevin Marsh", "Erica, I don\u2019t have an exact number of how you break that down between nuclear and the base business. I mean we are more conservative about the business than we were a few months ago as we outlined on the year-end call, but I\u2019d also say it\u2019s not as simple as just parsing those and saying well, if you\u2019re not doing new nuclear what\u2019s the underlying growth? Because we\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to have generation on the system to meet customers\u2019 needs down the road, and let\u2019s take the extreme case and say there\u2019s a long-term delay or even a stoppage to new nuclear development. Well, under the law in South Carolina we\u2019re going to take the accumulated equip costs to date and go to the Commission and get that amortized over some period to start getting the actual return of that investment back to investors", "We\u2019re also going to begin some type of new generation solution, most likely I would presume some type of combined cycle gas units. So we have looked at that scenario in the extreme case, contingency plan only, and still think that falls within the long-term earnings guidance that we provided.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Right, absolutely understood and I definitely understand that there\u2019s a need for sort of additional base load generation in some form or another in the unlikely event\u2026 I guess it sounds like the nuclear project was cancelled. I guess my question was more to the existing outlook today. I think one of the things that people kind of struggle to get their arms around is you know, you\u2019ve got this 3% to 5% growth rate and how much of that is driven by new nuclear or something else if new nuclear were not to work out; versus how much is driven by organic growth in the business sort of excluding the larger sort of base rate addition-type projects?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, and again, I don\u2019t have an exact number to it but certainly the majority of it now is driven by the CAPEX for the new nuclear because of the other CAPEX is basically funded by the cash of the existing business. So there\u2019s the depreciation from the existing business netted with the new CAPEX, there\u2019s not a significant amount of rate base going in there. Until customer growth returns in the southeast to the levels more like there was in the past that\u2019s going to be the case. It\u2019s going to be driven from rate base addition, not from new customers.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, gotcha. So then just remind me for that 3% to 5%, it\u2019s actually just for your 2011 guidance. What\u2019s the load growth, the sales growth function in that range? I think you talked about it on the Q4 call but I can\u2019t remember it off the top of my head.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, we\u2019ve got very little growth in there, maybe less than 1% customer growth in that plan which is basically what we\u2019re experiencing to this point.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Customer growth \u2013 that\u2019s kilowatt hour sales or growth in number of customers?", "Kevin Marsh", "Number of customers. We\u2019ve not presumed that existing customers change their patterns in the near term.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, of usage, got it, got it.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Kevin Marsh", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Adola Murdhi representing CDP Capital. Please proceed.", "Adola Murdhi \u2013 CDP Capital", "Good afternoon. Let\u2019s see, I think has to do a little bit with one of your other questions about how operations and procedures might change post-Japan. I\u2019m just wondering whether we\u2019ve seen over a period of years, the last 10, 15 years a significant reduction in the outage days in terms of doing a turnaround for refueling and other types of things at the nuclear units and across the industry. And I\u2019m wondering at a minimum whether you feel there\u2019s a possibility that those types of fast turnarounds and those types of things may in the future need to be extended if just nothing else, just as a precaution and just to perhaps have more vigorous, enhanced inspections and other types of things while you have the opportunity, while the plant\u2019s down?", "Steve Byrne", "This is Steve, I\u2019ll take that one. There is nothing that we\u2019ve seen coming out of Japan so far that would say that their problems or their issues have been caused by a lack of maintenance and/or preventative maintenance or modifications to their facilities. So I would not see any impact on outage duration to the US nuclear industry as a result of Japan, at least from what we have seen so far.", "Adola Murdhi \u2013 CDP Capital", "And no indications from regulatory bodies or anything like that about that type of a short-term response?", "Steve Byrne", "No. Again, I\u2019m struggling to come up with an example of something that we would do in an outage that would need to be extended. The problem again was the tsunami and the initiating event was an earthquake off the coast, and I don\u2019t know of anything at the plants that they would do in a normal refueling-type shut down and maintenance outage that would necessitate making it longer that would help them deal with what they saw in Japan.", "Adola Murdhi \u2013 CDP Capital", "Alright, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi guys, easy question \u2013 what do you think your timing is for the next round of general rate cases at both SCE&G Electric and Gas as well as the North Carolina Gas utility?", "Kevin Marsh", "Mike, we haven\u2019t picked any particular dates. That\u2019s something we evaluate on an annual basis depending on what the earned returns are. Certainly at the 10% level I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely we would seek any additional rate relief. I really think it\u2019s dependent upon how quickly we see customer growth come back to the system in terms of what would drive capital spending that would be at cost or higher than what we\u2019re seeing in annual deprecation rates that would need to be recovered for the process; or if we have extreme environmental expenditures that aren\u2019t in the budget today it might come down later that we have to do, we\u2019d have to get recovery of those to make sure we could get a shareholder return back to those investors.", "But if you look back to what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve kind of been on a two- to three-year cycle. And that\u2019s not an absolute predictor of the future but certainly we\u2019ll look at that on a year-to-year basis.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it, okay. Thanks guys.", "Kevin Marsh", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Reeder representing Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hey Kevin, you just mentioned potential environmental spend. Assuming the nuclear project goes forward on time and in line with the EPA\u2019s proposed rules, I mean what sort of environmental compliance spend do you forecast and you know, what\u2019s the timing on that?", "Kevin Marsh", "I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve had enough time to evaluate how the particular rules may impact our current plants. We\u2019ve got six plants on our system; we\u2019ve made significant expenditures in those plants over the last decade. As you know, the rate case we had last year was to put two scrubbers and an SCR in for three of our larger plants. We have other plants that are smaller that it might not be economical to add equipment to depending on what final rules and regulations might be. That\u2019s flexibility we have built in in our integrated resource plan that we have provided to the Commission in terms of the possibility of not running or eventually retiring some of those older units when the nuclear plants come online, so we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that.", "Based on what we\u2019ve got in the plan that gives us the flexibility to respond to an economy that might stay the same that it is today, or if it increases that\u2019ll give us some flexibility to respond to that also.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "But would you expect that if you retire some of the smaller plants the larger ones that you do have scrubbers on or SCR\u2019s, there would be some additional compliance CAPEX in the way of maybe bag houses [ph] or something that we might see in say 2013, \u201814, \u201815 timeframe?", "Kevin Marsh", "I might let Steve give you some more detail on that in terms of the type of equipment that would be on but the three largest plants virtually have the equipment that we know are available today from the technology perspective. You may want to add some color to that, Steve.", "Steve Byrne", "All of our larger plants have got the scrubbers, SCR\u2019s, and bag houses [ph], even a couple of our smaller plants have bag houses for particular controls. So again, as Kevin said, it hasn\u2019t even been noted in the Federal Registry yet. They\u2019ve got a comment period and it\u2019ll be November sometime at the earliest before we see any kind of a final rule promulgated; and we\u2019re going to need to see what that looks like prior to making any decisions on plants. But at our larger units we would not anticipate any significant actions with regard to environmental CAPEX for those units to come into compliance with what we understand to be the rules so far.", "Jonathan Reeder \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay, thanks, that\u2019s very helpful.", "Operator", "With no further questions in the queue I would now like to turn the call back over to Jimmy Addison for closing remarks. You may proceed.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks. Just to summarize we\u2019re really pleased with our Q1 results. Our weather normalization mechanisms continue to provide us greater predictability in our earnings patterns for the majority of our businesses. Our nuclear project continues to move forward on schedule and under budget and our service territories continue to experience customer growth. We\u2019re optimistic about our future and look forward to further success in 2011, and we thank all of you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in Scana.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

Thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, August 4, 2011. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron Hinson", "Thank you and I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know earlier today we announced financial results for the second quarter 2011. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Marsh, President of SCANA; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.", "The slides and the earnings release that we\u2019ll refer to in this call are available at scana.com. Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today\u2019s call that are not statements of historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which are shown on slide 2 and discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Finally as noted on slide 2, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Regulation G information can be found on our website.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Byron and good afternoon. I would like to welcome each of you to our call. Let\u2019s start on slide 3, which reflects 2011 second quarter basic earnings per share of $0.44 compared to $0.43 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate increases and lower operations and maintenance expenses which were partially offset by higher property taxes, depreciation, interest expense, and share dilution.", "In addition, we experienced a weather benefit of $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2010 in the Electric business. Of course we now have an electric weather normalization mechanism, effective in August of 2010 so our margins do not experience large fluctuations due to weather.", "Please turn to slide 4. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, basic earnings per share were $1.44 compared to $1.45 for the same period in 2010. Increases in electric margin from base rate increases and lower operations and maintenance expenses were more than offset by the abnormal weather in the prior year, a gas rate decrease under the Rate Stabilization Act, higher interest expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Based upon our results to date and our expectation for the balance of the year, we are re-affirming our 2011 earnings guidance of $2.95 to $3.10 per share with an internal target of $3.02. We continue to actively monitor the economy and aggressively manage operations and maintenance expenses.", "Now on slide 5, I\u2019d like to review results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G\u2019s second quarter 2011 earnings denoted in blue were down $0.02 per share compared to 2010. As I mentioned earlier, the second quarter of 2010 included a weather benefit of $0.06 per share. In the current quarter, our electric weather normalization mechanism removed the impact of abnormal weather from our margins.", "Additionally, improved electric margins from base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and the mid-2010 retail electric rate case were offset by increases in depreciation, interest, and dilution related to our CapEx program. At June 30, 2011, SCE&G was serving approximately 664,000 electric customers and approximately 313,000 natural gas customers, up 0.6% and 1.0% respectively over the same dates in 2010.", "PSNC Energy in red reported a seasonal loss of less than $1 million or $0.01 per share in the current quarter, relatively unchanged from the prior year. Lower operations and maintenance expense and increases in margin from customer growth of approximately 1.6% offset decreases in other income.", "SCANA Energy in green reported a seasonal loss of $0.02 per share during the quarter compared to a loss of $0.05 in the prior year. The $0.03 change is driven by cooler weather early in the quarter compared to last year and lower operating expenses. SCANA Energy was serving approximately 460,000 customers as of June 30, 2011. SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01, unchanged compared to the same quarter last year.", "On slides 6 and 7, you see our electric and gas sales statistics, unit sales of electricity and natural gas to our retail customers in the second quarter of 2011 were up over the prior year. Of course, our WNA and CUT mechanisms normalize margin and not unit sales. The industrial sector continued to show signs of recovery with an increase in both electric and gas sales.", "On slide 8, you can see an update of economic expansion announcements during the second quarter of 2011. These recent announcements suggest the creation of approximately 500 new jobs with an investment of more than $230 million. At the bottom of the page, you will find unemployment data. If you look to the far right of this chart, you\u2019ll find data for the Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina metropolitan areas. These areas include a large portion of our electric service territory. As you can see from the numbers, the unemployment rate in those areas is slightly better than national rate and the rates of the three states in which we operate. We are pleased that our territories continue to see customer growth, and announcements of jobs and investment. As these trends continue, lower unemployment will be expected to follow.", "Please turn to slide 9. In May, we completed our previously announced debt issuances for 2011. We refinanced $300 million in medium term notes at SCANA and also we issued $100 million in new first mortgage bonds at SCE&G. We were pleased with investor response to both of these transactions, and I am delighted to have completed these (inaudible) prior to the recent turmoil in Washington related to debt limits.", "As previously discussed, we continue to recognize a cash benefit from bonus depreciation and from the election to account for certain maintenance cost as current expense for tax purposes. Combined, we expect these strategies to generate over $60 million of cash benefit for 2011. Accordingly, we do not expect to draw the remaining funds under our May 2010 equity forward until 2012, delaying the impact of share dilution.", "Finally, I would like to touch briefly on the earned regulatory returns at our three largest regulated subsidiaries. As you can see on slide 10, our electric business earned 9.16% for the 12 months ended March 31. This figure does not include any new nuclear CWIP or associated rate increases as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act.", "Since the time of our latest electric rate case filing, which used the test year ended September 30, 2009, we have seen increases in costs such as property taxes, depreciation, and interest, which have put downward pressure on our actual regulatory return.", "As of March 31, our gas businesses at SCE&G was earning approximately 8%. Under the terms of the Rate Stabilization Act, we have applied for an increase of $8.64 million to restore the return to 10.25%. After an audit of the application, the new gas rates will become effective in November. Our North Carolina gas business continues to perform well and is earning its allowed return. As you can see from the timeline at the bottom of the chart, we have completed most of our planned regulatory filings for the year.", "In addition to the items shown on this slide, we will continue to make quarterly filings with the South Carolina PSC related to our nuclear construction project and for the electric and gas businesses at SCE&G.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks, Jimmy. Let me turn now to our new nuclear project activities on slide 11. I am very pleased to report that our project for the two new units remains on budget and on schedule for completion in 2016 and 2019 respectively. In May 2011, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act.", "The revenue increase requested was $58.5 million based on estimated incremental CWIP through June 2011 of approximately $485 million. Earlier this week, the Office of Regulatory Staff filed their report related to the requested increase. The report reflected actual CWIP through June of $437 million and a resulting rate increase of $52.8 million. We agree with the revised amount from the ORS report. After approval by the South Carolina Public Service Commission, this will be the fourth rate increase we have received under the BLRA. The revised rate will go into effect in November.", "Please turn to slide 12. On May 16, 2011, we filed our quarterly status report with the PSC and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the first quarter of 2011. This report provides a detailed update of capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website. As shown on the slide, we are $163 million under the capital cost approved by the Commission, most of which is due to lower-than-anticipated escalation. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the same quarter of 2011 on August 15.", "Recently Duke Energy and the Florida Municipal Power Agency announced that they both had signed letters of intent with Santee Cooper for potential minority interest in Santee\u2019s 45% ownership of the new nuclear units under construction at V.C. Summer. Santee Cooper continues to be a co-owner and co-applicant in V.C. Summer units 2 and 3 as set forth in the combined license application currently being reviewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And, we do not expect these letters of intent or the one that Santee Cooper has signed with the Orlando Utilities Commission to have an impact on the issuance of our COL.", "If Santee Cooper decides to move forward with a sale of a portion of its output or interest in the two new nuclear units, it would help Santee accomplish its previously stated objective of lowering its participation in these two units. SCE&G will continue to operate the two new units, and there is no change in our 55% share of ownership which is needed to meet customer demand, comply with environmental regulations, and reduce carbon emissions.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve Byrne to discuss our COL status and environmental regulations.", "Stephen Byrne", "Thanks, Kevin. I\u2019d now like to direct your attention to slide number 13. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. This past Tuesday, we received a letter from the NRC Office of New Reactors that outlines an updated schedule for issuing our Final Safety Evaluation Report or FSER. The letter made three points.", "First, the staff concluded that they have all the information they need to complete the safety review and that our application was complete. Second, the review supports the issuance of our FSER in September, and third, the completion of the mandatory hearing on the V.C. Summer COL application including issuance of a Commission decision should be no later than four months from the issuance of the latter of the FEIS which we received in April or the FSER which the letter states will be received in September.", "So, the remaining issue is the ultimate approval of the AP1000 certified design itself. Westinghouse submitted DCD Revision 19 to the NRC on June 13. After the NRC\u2019s review of this design revision, the next step would be the issuance of the final safety evaluation report for the AP1000 design, which we believe to be imminent. Following that, the NRC will go for a rule-making process which we anticipate will provide for the receipt our COL within our previously announced timeframe of late 2011 or early 2012. As Tuesday\u2019s NRC letter suggests, we anticipate a Commission decision to approve our COL no later than January of 2012.", "I\u2019d like now to spend a few minutes to touch on the NRC taskforce report on the Fukushima accident, or the so-called 90-day report that was issued on July 12. SCE&G has consistently embraced measures which protect public health and safety. Recognizing this report is early in the process. We fully support assessments by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other independent oversight authorities that might help further improve safe operation of nuclear reactors in the U.S. now and in the future.", "SCE&G remains committed to its nuclear strategy, which includes operating Unit 1 safely and progressing with the plans for Units 2 and 3. This is consistent with conclusions in the 90-day report. The report concluded that continued operation and continued licensing activities do not pose an eminent risk to public health and safety, and we are certainly in agreement with that statement. The taskforce also supported completing the design certification and rule-making activities for the AP 1000 without delay.", "Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the impact of environmental regulations on our coal fleet as seen on slide 14. On July 6, 2011, the EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. This rule replaces the Clean Air Interstate Rule and is aimed at addressing power plant emissions that may contribute to air pollution in other states. The rule requires states in the Eastern United States to reduce power plant emissions, specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. In general, the most effective control technologies for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions are the combination of scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction or SCR.", "As you can see from this slide, around 70% of our coal megawatts already have a scrubber and SCR installed. These units account for approximately 80% of our dispatched total generation. In anticipation of more regulation, we will continue to pursue additional strategies and evaluate emissions-reduction technologies, to ensure that we are in compliance with all environmental regulations.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from the line of Andrew Levi from Caris & Company.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co., Inc.", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon.", "Stephen Byrne", "Good afternoon.", "Jimmy Addison", "See you.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co., Inc.", "I guess, on August 1, Moody\u2019s issued a credit research report on you guys and put you on a outlook \u2013 I guess it\u2019s negative outlook. But I think it sounds like they\u2019re just going to downgrade your ratings at SCANA, issuer ratings, senior unsecured, junior subordinated, and commercial paper, but again just on the SCANA level it seems like is the bigger issue.", "And then, I guess your issuer rating at SCE&G, but on the ones that are Baa2, just in general, could be the ones that are Baa3 on junior subordinated. What if any implications does that have? I mean, I don\u2019t know if there are any, I\u2019m just going back to like, the Enron days, but any type of triggers, anything in your indenture, anything like that that you would have to put up any type of cash or just in general, what are the implications if you were to get a one notch downgrade on these various things that have been put on watch for downgrade?", "Kevin Marsh", "Right. Well, it is disappointing, but I think practically to get to your question, there\u2019s very little impact. We have one financing to do at the holding company in the next nine years, that\u2019s next year, it\u2019s actually a refinancing, not new money for about $250 million. So, that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s really in our headlights for the \u2013 as I said, the next nine years through 2019.", "The only other implication would be slightly higher cost for short-term money, if we were to borrow any at the holco. We have not had any commercial paper program at the holding company until we renewed our credit facility this past fall. We instituted one at the holco and have used it sparingly. We don\u2019t expect to use it a great deal, but that market is not as liquid as the P2 market, if were to be downgraded to P3 at the holco, but of course, we got the credit facilities in place that we could fall back on and borrow. But we really put that there as just a contingency anyway.", "So all of our financing for the CapEx is going to be \u2013 we plan to be through first mortgage bonds at SCE&G, of course, most of our commercial paper is there or at the fuel company, which are not part of this review, and we would expect that when we come out of this that all of the entities will be on \u2013 probably on stable outlook, which will kind of remove that overhang from the SCE&G.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co., Inc.", "And again, there\u2019s no type of collateral issues, or anything like that, that if you were down to Baa3 on the issuer rating or the unsecured rating, or cut the junk in junior subordinated, there is no...", "Kevin Marsh", "Not aware of anything like that.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co., Inc.", "Right. Okay. I appreciate that. I think that\u2019s it for now. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Erica Piserchia with Wunderlich Securities.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Hi, everybody. Just a few questions. I guess, first, Jimmy, you mentioned earned returns at the utility and some higher costs; I\u2019m just wondering whether or not this changes your thinking in terms of when you might go in and file for your next rate case?", "Jimmy Addison", "Not really. I mean we\u2019ve historically been on a two to three year cycle at each of the regulated entities. We just had the increase last July. So, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re near that range at all at this point. And we\u2019ve talked a great deal over the last several quarters about the industrial announcements that are out there. You see another good quarter in industrial usage this quarter, even over a growth year last year, so we\u2019re looking for that to start to pay off at some point in additional jobs and hopefully buoy the residential the commercial markets. But, we really don\u2019t see any change in that at the near-term.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. I guess, I\u2019m just a little confused because \u2013 so you\u2019ve got some higher costs kind of coming in and yet you\u2019re not seeing a ton of growth on your customer base. Is that that you\u2019re spending sort of in anticipation, as you just mentioned, of this recovery or there is something else going on there?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I think you need to look at the nature of those costs and if you have a copy of the press release handy; on page 5, where we do the variance explanations, you\u2019ll see that O&M cost is actually down for the quarter and year-to-date.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "But we\u2019re just talking about like depreciation and interest...", "Jimmy Addison", "Exactly. It\u2019s all capital program-related. It\u2019s depreciation, property taxes and interest or dilution, whether it\u2019s debt or equity, and of course in our case it\u2019s about 50-50. So, it\u2019s all related to that, we\u2019re well within that capital plan, so it\u2019s not a surprise to us at all. More of the drift down this quarter is just due to the dropping off of that weather benefit that was in the second quarter of 2010, the last full quarter before we implemented the weather normalization, so that was a step down that we anticipated in and realized.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. And then just on the nuclear side, I mean, I know things are progressing, it seems like we\u2019re getting a little bit more communication on timing, maybe from the NRC with yesterday\u2019s announcement, but I really did never ask you guys this, but would you ever consider filing for a limited work authorization along the lines of what Southern has done?", "Stephen Byrne", "Yeah, we have in the past considered limited work authorizations, Southern\u2019s first LWA was specific to their site and it\u2019s something that we did not need and we considered the second LWA that Southern signed, we were looking at something very similar but you have to remember that it\u2019s the same agency and the same staff of that agency that we have to review the limited work authorization, and our evaluation showed that we might be able to save a few weeks to a month which I think is probably about where Southern is and based on the level of effort, the cost and the potential distraction of the NRC, we decided that was not worthwhile, so we don\u2019t anticipate any limited work authorizations.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Okay, thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jim von Riesemann with UBS.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Good afternoon, gentlemen.", "Kevin Marsh", "Hi, Jim.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hi, Jim.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "A question on this \u2013 I wanted to follow up on some of Kevin\u2019s comments in his prepared remarks, but Santee Cooper\u2019s potential sell-down and their stake in the new units, what role do you have or what say do you have in any of \u2013 if that occurs?", "Jimmy Addison", "You get some new co-owners?", "Kevin Marsh", "We\u2019ve talked about this before, and let me go back to it again. Any sale of their 45% portion of the new plant does require our approval and the approval of the South Carolina Commission, and if they just decide to sell the power and not actually sell the portion of the asset, it doesn\u2019t require any approval from us, but if they do decide to actually sell assets or their portion from the 45%, we do have the right to approve that, and once we were to do that, it would go to the South Carolina Commission, but that\u2019s not something I see that would stand in the way of them trying to accomplish their goals.", "Now, they\u2019ve certainly been working hard to lower that level of ownership and these letters of intent they signed are very important step. Our relationship with Santee continues to be strong and I think they\u2019ll continue to be a great partner with us as we go forward, because they still do plan on maintaining a significant portion of their original investment. And we\u2019re working with them to help them achieve their goals.", "So they\u2019ve been doing that negotiating and as they go forward at the appropriate time, we\u2019ll have a chance to look at what they\u2019ve negotiated and decide if that\u2019s in the best interest of the project. But I\u2019m comfortable if that\u2019s something they want to move forward with we\u2019ll find a way to work that out than take it to the Commission.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Just and then a follow-up question. What do you think the mechanics are with respect to an actual sale of the facility itself rather than the output? I mean how do they think about the economics? Santee has already dedicated certain amount of dollar amount. Are they going to get recovered dollar for dollar and they don\u2019t have to worry about earnings per share, I know the state doesn\u2019t, but how should we think about that?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, I certainly don\u2019t think they would be interested in moving those assets at a loss compared to where they\u2019ve invested. I think the price they\u2019ve invested in this project from their perspective and also from ours, even though we\u2019re regulated and they\u2019re not, is a very favorable price. We think it\u2019s going to be competitive over the long term. I know they believe that too, which is why they certainly want to stay in for as much as they think they\u2019ll need.", "So, I can\u2019t speak for them, but I\u2019d be surprised if they were looking to look out or to move this at some sort of fire sale price. It\u2019s a valuable asset, but I think once the COLs are actually issued, will become even more valuable. So, we\u2019ll look forward to that and see what we can do to help them. But in the meantime, our 55% need does not change. I\u2019ve gotten that question a lot too. We remain committed to our 55%. We certainly need that to meet the needs of our customers and that really hasn\u2019t changed.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s all I had today. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question will come from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, Jimmy, got a just a rate increase favor to ask, can you kind of bridge us meaning rate increases that are last to go in to rates in the second half of this year or that were granted or sitting on the table to be granted for implementation in the back end of this year or beginning of next year. Just trying to true up my numbers to make sure I\u2019ve got the appropriate amount of rate increases, what\u2019s already been taken, what\u2019s left to be taken, but already approved etcetera?", "Jimmy Addison", "Michael, the short answer to that is, from a financial statement perspective, it\u2019s indifferent. The only difference is what comes in to cash because you may remember the two things that we used to phase that in was the $25 million weather \u2013 favorable weather from the first quarter of 2010, we\u2019re going to spread that back over the first year.", "So, that\u2019s essentially all been given back in an amortization now, so we brought that income in to offset the lack of the cash increase from the customers, so that was a wash. And the second one was the tax credits that we phased in over a two-year period, the EIZ tax credit, state investment credits. But, in both of those cases even though the customers hasn\u2019t seen the full increase until a 24-month period, the financial statements are getting the full benefit from day one.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. But that\u2019s just the core base rates on the electric side at SCE&G. Can you \u2013 like how much of the last granted BLRA increase has actually been recovered year-to-date versus is remaining for third in \u2013 through mid-November recovery, meaning what was put in the rates in November of last year?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, I mean I don\u2019t have this. I see what you\u2019re asking, Michael, I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips. I don\u2019t have the cyclical division of the total number, how much of it\u2019s been recognized year-to-date at my fingertips, but we can get you that.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah, I would love to \u2013 and I\u2019m trying to do it for BLRA granted and implemented in November of \u201810, trying to do it if there is anything left on the SCE&G electric. I see the SCE&G electric \u2013 I mean gas rate increase request the $8 million plus and then obviously the BLRA filing for the coming November implementation?", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure, yeah, we can provide that. Of course we\u2019ve considered all three of those in our earnings guidance for the year.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood.", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "One another question, just general O&M trajectory and general trajectory of interest expense, kind of through the end of this year versus what you\u2019ve recorded in the first half of the year?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. Well, generally interest is going to be increasing as we increase the CapEx program and of course we have financed almost the entirety of our debt portfolio with fixed rate financing. So we have very little risk when if rates ever move back up. We\u2019ve protected against that since we\u2019re financing long-term assets here.", "But on operating cost, we\u2019ve really worked very hard to keep those down and you see they are in the information that we\u2019ve released today as I alluded to earlier, we\u2019re down both for the quarter and year-to-date on operating costs about $5 million year-to-date and that\u2019s in spite of a modest salary increases earlier this year for the first time in three years. So we\u2019re working hard on that. We continue to work hard on that for the 2012 plan and I\u2019m encouraged by the direction we\u2019re headed. So I would think we can maintain the cost control as we move through this period until the economy takes a definitive direction up.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Okay. Thank you, Jimmy. I\u2019ll follow up offline.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Andrew Levi with Caris & Company.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co., Inc.", "Hi, did you guys say that you were done on the debt side for the year? Is that what you said?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So nothing needs to be issued in this crazy market?", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s exactly right. We completed everything at the end of May.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then is there any type of guidance you can give us for the third and fourth quarters?", "Jimmy Addison", "In what regard?", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co., Inc.", "Earnings, kind of a breakdown of earnings for the third and fourth quarter, what we should be thinking about, I don\u2019t know if you want to give on a percent basis, anything like that relative to last year?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, well we\u2019ve reaffirmed our guidance obviously with $2.95 to $3.10 in our \u2013 for your benefit our internal target\u2019s about $3.02. And as I told you earlier in the year on our yearend call, when we gave guidance, we really target about 25% of our plan is in the third quarter and slightly under 30% in the fourth quarter.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. That does conclude the Q&A of today\u2019s conference. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jimmy Addison for closing comments.", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay, well, thank you. To summarize, we\u2019re very pleased with the second quarter results. Our basic earnings for the quarter are higher than the prior year, which included a significant weather benefit in the prior year. Our territories continue to experience modest customer growth and significant industrial expansion and our nuclear project continues to move forward on schedule and under budget. We\u2019re optimistic about the remainder of the year and look forward to speaking with you about that in the future.

Thank you for standing by. My name is (Rocco) and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Wednesday, October 26, 2011. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off from the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron Hinson \u2013 Director, Financial Planning and Investor Relations", "Thank you and I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know earlier today, we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2011.", "Joining us on the call today are Kevin Marsh, President of SCANA; Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G; and Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. The slides and the earnings release that we\u2019ll refer to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today\u2019s call which are not statements of historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties which are shown on slide two and discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings. The company does not recognize obligation to update any forward looking statements.", "Finally as noted on slide two, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Regulation G information can be found on Investor Relations website.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin.", "Kevin Marsh \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Byron, and thank you all for joining us today. During today\u2019s call, we will provide an update on our nuclear project and our recent hearing before the NRC. We will also discuss our results for the third quarter and our financial guidance for the balance of 2011 and for 2012. As you all know, Bill Timmerman announced his retirement earlier this year. He will be retiring at the end of November and I will be moving into my new role as CEO.", "Bill and I have worked together for many years. He has and will continue to be a valuable resource for me personally and for the company. I am pleased to report that our transition is progressing as planned and I look forward to my new responsibilities. We continue to see significant industrial announcements in our service territory.", "On slide three, we have provided an update of economic expansion announcements. This period was very impressive including a large expansion at the Bridgestone tire facility in Aiken County and a new continental tire operation in Sumter County. In total, announcement since July 1st suggest a creation of over 3000 new jobs with an investment of approximately $1.9 billion. This brings our year-to-date planned industrial investments to over $2.5 billion with more than 5,500 job additions.", "In addition to industrial growth, we also continue to see customer growth in our residential and commercial categories. These are promising signs of economic recovery and we are excited to be positioned to provide clean, safe, reliable energy for the citizens and industries in South Carolina in the future.", "Please turn to slide four. We\u2019ve set forth our regulated returns and related filings. The chart at the top of the slide shows allowed returns at our three largest regulated subsidiaries as of June 30, 2011, the date of our most recent filing. The third quarter earned returned filings for our Electric and Gas businesses will be made in mid-December.", "Our electric business earned 8.6%. The decrease from the previous filing was due primarily to the elimination of the second quarter of 2010, which was positively impacted by weather. You might recall beginning in the third quarter of 2010 we implemented a weather normalization mechanism, so our returns at the Electric business are no longer impacted by weather. This figure does not include any new nuclear CWFE or associated rate increases, as those allowances were handled separately under the Base Load Review Act.", "As of June 30, 2011, our gas business at SCE&G was earning approximately 7.72%. This does not incorporate the recent 8.5 million rate increase, will effective in November of this year under the Rate Stabilization Act. This increase will restore the return to approximately 10.25%. And overall earned returns in the Gas business fall 50 basis points above or below our allowed return of 10.25%, we adjust rates through our annual Rate Stabilization filing.", "Our North Carolina gas business continues to perform well, and is earnings its allowed return principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. As you can see form timeline at the bottom of this slide, we have completed all of our \u2013 one of our plan regulatory filings for the year.", "On slide five, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.8 million or approximately 2.4% to the retail electric rates of SCE&G. The new rates will be effective for bills rendered on or after October 30 of this year.", "Our BLRA filings for 2011 are shown at the bottom of the slide. As you can see, on August 15th we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with a commission and office of regulatory staff for the second quarter of 2011. This report provides a detailed update of capital cost incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2011 on November 14th. I am pleased to report that our project for the two new units continues to be on budget and on schedule for completion in 2016 and 2019, respectively.", "Finally, SCE&G and Santee recently executed the permanent construction and operating agreements, which will govern and construction and operation of the new nuclear facilities. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have a primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the units and will be responsible for the operation of the units as they come on line.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Stephen Byrne to discuss some other aspects of our nuclear project and environmental matters.", "Steve Byrne \u2013 Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Kevin. I would now like to direct your attention to slide number six. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s licensing proceedings continued to progress towards a successful conclusion. Please focus on the blue section of the chart.", "On October 13, we completed the uncontested mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. SCE&G believes it presented evidence that all requirements have been met to allow the NRC to issue the combined construction and operating license for V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3. We anticipate a decision from the NRC regarding our COL in the coming months.", "Now if I can get you to focus on the green section of the chart related to the approval of the 81000 certified design, you see it as in the rule making process. The NRC has indicated that the full commission intends to act on the final certification by year end. This timeline continues to align with our expectation that we\u2019ll receive our COL in late 2011 or early 2012.", "As Kevin mentioned, construction of the units is progressing on schedule and continues to support the units coming online in 2016 and 2019. As we have previously discussed earlier this year we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study. You might recall that this study related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the anticipated COL issuance of mid 2011 timeframe when we signed the EPC contract in 2008 to the current timeframe of late 2011 early 2012. This study is not in any way an indication that we are expecting additional delays in receipt of the COL.", "This study provides for three scenarios. The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out the commercial operation date for Unit 2 by six months. The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2 and accelerating the date for Unit 3 in order to take advantages of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. By narrowing the gap between the units, it may be possible to create construction efficiencies by avoiding the demobilization and remobilization of crews as we progress from one unit to the next. SCE&G has been negotiations with the Shaw Westinghouse consortium to determine the preferred scenario. We do not anticipate a decision on the COL Delay study until later this year.", "Finally, I would like to briefly touch on the impact of environmental regulations on our coal fleet. Please turn to slide number seven. We continue to evaluate the impact of alignment of regulations, particularly the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. The rule requires states in the Eastern U.S. to reduce power plant emissions specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. At this time we still believe the most effective control technologies for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions are the combination of scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction or SCRs.", "As you can see in the top of this chart on the slide 69% of our coal capacity already has scrubber and SCR technology. These units account for approximately 80% of our dispatched coal generation as these are our larger, more efficient plants. The charts at the bottom of the slide demonstrate our current and anticipated generation mix after the two new nuclear plants at V.C. Summer come online.", "Our coal fleet composes slightly over 50% of our current generation mix. We anticipate that percentage to drop to 24% as we will rely less heavily on coal in the future. In anticipation of more regulation we will continue to pursue additional strategies and evaluate emissions reduction technologies to ensure that we are in compliance with all environmental regulations.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy Addison.", "Jimmy Addison \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. Let\u2019s start on slide eight which reflects 2011 third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.81 compared to $0.80 in 2010. The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to improved margins from electric base rate increases which were partially offset by interest expense and share dilution.", "On slide nine for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, basic earnings per share were $2.25 per share unchanged from the same period in 2010. Increases in electric margin from base rate increases and lower operation and maintenance expenses were partially offset by the gas rate decrease under the rate stabilization act that was effective in November 2010, higher interest expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Based upon our results to date and our expectation for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2011 earnings guidance of $2.95 to $3.10 per share with our internal target of $3.02 per share.", "Now on slide 10, I\u2019d like to review results by principle lines of business. SCE&G third quarter 2011 earnings denoted in blue were $0.05 per share higher than 2010. Improved electric margins from base rate increases under the base load review act were partially offset by increases in depreciation, interest, and dilution. At September 30, 2011 SCE&G was serving approximately 665,000 electric customers and approximately 313,000 natural gas customers, up 0.8% and 1.3% respectively over the same date in 2010. The PSNC energy in red reported the seasonal loss of $0.03 per share in the current quarter compared to $0.04 per share in the prior year. Increased margin from customer growth of approximately 1.7% was slightly offset by depreciation and property taxes.", "SCANA Energy in green reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share during the quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in the prior year. The $0.01 change is driven by lower margins which were partially offset by lower operating expenses. SCANA Energy was serving approximately 450,000 customers as of September 30. SCANA Energy along with three other marketers entered the bid process to service the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming term of September 2012 through August 2014. The commission is scheduled to make a selection in February 2012. SCANA Energy has served as a regulator provider since 2002. SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share during the third quarter of 2010. The results for 2011 reflect higher income taxes at the holding company during the quarter due to levelizing the effective tax rate as required by accounting standards.", "Slides 11 and 12 show our electric and gas sales statistics. These numbers have not been weather normalized. Recall that our WNA and CUT mechanisms normalize margin but obviously not unit sales. Retail sales of electricity are down 1.5% for the quarter due to lower residential and commercial sales primarily as a result of milder weather this year, partially offset by higher industrial sales. Retail sales of natural gas showed a decrease of 1.8% for the quarter. While the residential and commercial categories showed improvement, industrial gas usage declined slightly when compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to lower sales for power generation in the current quarter, again driven by milder weather.", "Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on slide 13. Our 2012 preliminary guidance is $3.05 to $3.25 per share and our internal target is $3.17. This guidance assumes known industrial expansion and continued customer growth at recent levels. While we anticipate the number of customers will increase our assumption of usage per customer is slightly lower reflecting continued energy efficiency and the economy in general.", "As it relates to expenses, operations and maintenance expense is expected to remain relatively flat with modest growth related to CapEx expansion in property taxes, depreciation, interest expense and dilution. We project an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings and the RSA and the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies.", "These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing down the remainder of the equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012 and postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution in next year, as I\u2019ll discuss in more detail when I cover our financing plan shortly.", "As Steve mentioned earlier, we are still making a decision on the COL delay study. Our guidance is necessarily broader than normal to accommodate the range of potential outcomes he discussed. Once the decision on the study is finalized we will update you and provide information about how the decision impacts our guidance range, capital forecast, and financing plan.", "While we continue to see some signs of a longer term economic recovery, the signals are mixed. As a result, we remain conservative in our estimates and cautiously optimistic about our longer terms sustain recovery. We reaffirm our long-term outlook to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the next three to five years based on the 2010 weather-normalized base of 292.", "Slide 14 presents our preliminary CapEx forecast. The estimates for 2012 and \u201813 are slightly less than the forecast represented a year ago. As you can see from the slide, our new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our total capital spending over the next three years.", "Now please turn to slide 15. This slide represents our estimated financing plan through 2014. We anticipate completing two debt refinancings in 2012 and \u201813. Our only planned issuances of new debt will be at SCE&G to support our new nuclear construction. Regarding equity, we intend to continue to issue shares through our 401(k) and DRIP programs, yielding approximately $100 million per year.", "As mentioned in previous calls, we have adapted two tax strategies which have provided additional cash flow. These are bonus deprecation and the election to deduct repairs expense as opposed to capitalizing those costs. Because of the cash benefits we have seen from these strategies we planned to extend the May 2010 equity forward and postpone drawing the remaining funds and to the fourth quarter of 2012. We are working with the forward counterparties on the extension and expect to have it completed shortly.", "Our previous financing plan included an additional equity offering of $150 million in 2012, while our updated plans postpone this issuance until 2013. As a result, our 2012 plan is lower than previously announced while our 2013 plan has increased. We continued to evaluate our financing plan and develop strategies which align our debt and equity issuances with our cash needs for construction. This isn\u2019t a change in our overall strategy of financing the project 50/50 with debt and equity, but rather simply an adjustment in the execution to match previously unexpected cash flows. We\u2019re very pleased with the flexibility the forward structure has offered us during this period.", "In summary, we are pleased with our quarterly results and confident in our guidance for both 2011 and 2012.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Hi, how are you doing?", "Kevin Marsh", "Good, Paul.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Thanks for the presentation, as always very thorough. But just want to \u2013 I know you guys had the weather normalization clause but could you give us a flavor for what the weather-normalized growth has been, absent industrial?", "Kevin Marsh", "Sure, Paul. The short of it is it\u2019s been inconsistent much like the national and the local economy. But in short to your question there, for the quarter our residential weather-normalized growth is actually up slightly more than 1% and industrial is up similar amount, about 1.25%. The commercial is lagged behind, still slightly below last year\u2019s. And I think initially we\u2019ve talked in the past couple of calls about industrial leading the recovery, we are certainly seeing that with the discussion that Kevin took you through a few minutes ago, now it appears that some of this - at least in the short term has translated into residential consumption, but we\u2019ve yet to see it in commercial.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then could you just also just review about with respect to what\u2019s your expectations are again going forward for retail sales growth?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, we\u2019re \u2013 we expect growth of \u2013 as far as number of customers, new customers of something slightly less than 1% in the electric business and in the gas businesses ranging from a similar amount in South Carolina to about 1.75% in North Carolina and that\u2019s just numbers of customers. As far as usage, in North Carolina of course we have a cut mechanism that takes care of any change in usage related to efficiency et cetera and in the electric business we\u2019re assuming a slightly lower customer usage just driven off of efficiency, the CFL laws et cetera as it relate to 2012.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. So you if you see any change I guess \u2013 I guess it doesn\u2019t seem \u2013 you guys are still pretty much holding to what your economic impact on retail sales is going to be going forward. There really hasn\u2019t been a change from what we\u2019ve seen from I don\u2019t know there has been some sort of discussion, the slowdown perhaps happening in the economy going forward that perhaps I don\u2019t know \u2013 in the last quarter or so people have been sort of projecting more but you are not necessarily feeling that at that point \u2013 at this point, is that right?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve been more conservative about the forward expectations. There is a little bright spot in this quarter as far as non weather related usage at the residential area and certainly continue to see growth in industrial, just not ready to call that a trend yet.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot for the update.", "Kevin Marsh", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Steve Sanders of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.", "Steve Sanders \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Hey good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I think Steve you outlined kind of three options on related to the COL impact study. Can you just talk a little bit more about kind of the gating factors or the decision drivers of the three options, is it primarily financing, is it personnel, is it supply chain, just maybe give us a little bit more color on those things?", "Steve Byrne", "", "Yeah, sure. First of all, the supply chain really has not entered into the any of the gating factors. We anticipate that irregardless of the decision we make we\u2019re not going to take the pressure of the supply chain. So our expectation is that all of the components that are being manufactured will continue on their current manufacturing schedule and we\u2019ve got plenty of room onsite to store large components should they come in. So that\u2019s really not a consideration.", "So, really for us the considerations are the schedule and the cost implications of that schedule and then probably secondarily then is our desire to try to keep the trained workforce onsite actively engaged as long as we can and that\u2019s why in the third scenario that we are looking at which is really a compression of the schedules. We will allow the first new unit to be deferred for six months, but we\u2019ll bring the second new unit up earlier and that way we should avoid some of the demobilization/remobilization. So we\u2019ll keep that workforce more actively engaged and so the discussions we are having with the consortium now are how we value that versus how they value that and that\u2019s with the negotiations.", "Steve Sanders \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Okay, okay, thanks. That\u2019s pretty helpful. And then on the EPA slide I just wanted to clarify so the 80% of your coal generation that currently has the scrubbers or SCRs, is that in compliance? In other words the finalization of this rule change anything over the next year or two in terms of your spending on the existing coal fleet?", "Steve Byrne", "We don\u2019t see the changing anything on the existing coal fleet relative to capital expenditures based on the rule. Now the rule is also implemented in 2012 but I think it yet remains to be seen whether we\u2019ll see full compliance request in 2012 or whether that would be deferred, so they may delay the enforcement of the rule for some period of time which is not unusual from the EPA. But in the short term we don\u2019t see any impacts to our fleet, and we believe that the scrubber and SCR technologies along with the back houses and/or electrostatic precipitators we have installed in those bigger units should put us in compliance for those units. ", "Steve Sanders \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Andrew Levi of Caris. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "Hi, good afternoon. Back on the COL study can you give us some type of idea, I mean, obviously we\u2019re not sure obviously what it\u2019s going to come out with and what road you\u2019re going to go down but as we look at 12 or 13 or 14, and we\u2019re looking at significant changes in expenses or cost or I mean ultimately in the BLRA and how that will play out as far as rate increases and things like that and can you give us some type of idea what we should be kind of looking at and whether it should be a concern of ours or whether it\u2019s just more cosmetic in the changes that you will be making?", "Kevin Marsh", "Let me start off and then let Steven jump in if he\u2019d like. From our perspective, first of all for 2012 we\u2019ve been, as I said, a little broader in our guidance range than we normally would. Our intention would be, as these decisions are completed, to tighten that range hopefully in our year end call in February when we know the results of this. We feel like that range contemplates the variety of outcomes. In my opinion, this really has to do with recalibrating the full scale starting point once we give full notice to proceed to the vendor and not necessarily the whole process from here on out. There will be some ripples, I think throughout the following years, but it really has to do with how much does it impact 2012, and of course our fiscal year is different than our BLRA typical filing years. We typically make that filing in May or June. Steve, anything you\u2019d like to add?", "Steve Byrne", "I don\u2019t anticipate any significant changes in the near term but as we get out into those outer years of 13 or 14, what it may do is impact whether it\u2019s 2.5% or 2.7% increase in one year versus the next year. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a big overall change in where we end up but in inter year there could be some movement of those rate increases under the Base Load Review Act. While also our Base Load Review Act is predicated on milestones and we have a number of milestones that we report on quarterly in the quarterly update that we turn into our Public Service Commission. And currently we don\u2019t anticipate any changes to those milestones based on the negotiations going into on the COL delay study.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "Okay, that\u2019s great. \u201813 and \u201914, I understand, just back to 2012, what type of, there\u2019s no better way to put it, line items, I mean where in the income statement or the CapEx or cash flow where would \u2013 kind of get and speak \u2013 where we would see some changes\u2026", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "How significant would they be? I mean, I understand you have a $0.20 range in your revised guidance. But a little bit of help there?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, there are several moving parts if there were a change in the construction cost in 2012 it would certainly impact the amount of CapEx and therefore the amount that needs to be financed and so therefore it could impact interest expense or dilution from equity issuances. And also if there were less or more than we have currently in the CapEx plan it would potentially impact AFUDC or capitalized interest cost, or carrying cost, intra-BLRA increases and then ultimately the cash impact would in the amount that it would decrease or increase the projected BLRA filing that would be effective in November of 2012. So those are the four so moving parts related to that. We really \u2013 I understand you want a boundary but all we can \u2013 we can\u2019t really respond to that because we haven\u2019t quantified these different options that Steve outlined for you. We are waiting on the consortium to get to back to us on that, but we feel like at the outside those are all contemplated within this range.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "And the consortium is going to get back to you when?", "Kevin Marsh", "We expect to have that study completed and the discussions by the end of the year.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "But you want to talk to us about it until your first quarter call is that basically how is it going to play out?", "Kevin Marsh", "That would be the plan at this point. Once we get that contemplated and also during that time we certainly hope we get a better feel for where we are on the COL and once we have all those pieces of the puzzle, we\u2019ll be prepared in February to give you a complete update on the timing if it involves any significant changes.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "Great. And just on the low end can you give us kind of any idea of what you are thinking there relative to this process?", "Kevin Marsh", "I\u2019m not sure I understand your question, I mean\u2026?", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "I mean the low end of your guidance, I mean what assumptions have you made that incorporate this process?", "Kevin Marsh", "While on the low end of the guidance we\u2019ve obviously around the base business, we\u2019ve been more pessimistic about the economy et cetera and in addition to that we\u2019ve assumed that we spent X dollars less in the construction related to the nuclear plant, but I really can\u2019t get into defining a specific number in there for you because we don\u2019t have the solutions defined by the consortium.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "Okay, I tried. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Hi, good afternoon. Looking back at slide three with those new customers, what kind of additional volume would those new customers represent? And looking also at that 1.25% increase, how much of that was from those new customers?", "Kevin Marsh", "We typically don\u2019t disclose the amount of usage from those customers. They see it as fairly confidential and competitive but in aggregate all that\u2019s been considered in our guidance and as Jimmy said we think that\u2019s a great foundation for the opportunity to see the continued increase in residential and hopefully commercial down the line, but we have not provided any specific output or usage expectations for those facilities.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "If I backed out some of the new stuff from that one in the quarter, is it fair to say that core or legacy industrial demand was roughly flat or is that being too aggressive contribution from these new customers?", "Jimmy Addison", "No. Realize these are announcements that Kevin has covered, so these aren\u2019t in operation yet. These are just third quarter economic development announcements. What you see in the 1.25% growth in industrial is our legacy, operating industrial accounts.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay, great. And then one other unrelated question, the 800 megawatts of the uncontrolled coal that you still have, how much of that is at risk of closing based on Casper and the proposed air toxic rule that we\u2019ve seen?", "Kevin Marsh", "When we see the final impact of those rules and understand some of the rules that we\u2019re dealing with the one you mentioned, plus others, are not completely identified or quantified yet. Their implementation date isn\u2019t certain. But, sufficed to say that we think that the EPA rules and regulations that are coming out will have an adverse impact on coal plant, and in our latest Integrated Resource Plan that we file with the Commission, we did contemplate some coal plan retirements. Now, we didn\u2019t specify which plant, but we do have some retirement specified.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay. Did you have a megawatt capacity on that?", "Kevin Marsh", "We did for the number of megawatts in it and don\u2019t have the \u2013 my fingertips, so I\u2019d be guessing, but its a few hundred megawatts.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay. I\u2019ll go back and check that. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Erica Piserchia of Wunderlich Securities. Please go ahead.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Hi, just a quick follow-up question. I know Andy exhausted a lot of the questions on the coal guidance, but just can you give us \u2013 because it seems to me like the biggest maybe sensitively factor there is study which is still out there, and I know you talked about that the usage, do you have any kind of like sensitivity on an earnings per share basis to 10 basis point change in customer usage in the base business? Is that way to think about that?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Well, you\u2019re talking me on the coal business not to do with nuclear. On the electric side of the business, if usage varied 0.5%, it would make roughly $0.03 per share of change in the earnings per share.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, thanks. And then what allowed return or is your \u2013 your current allowed return embedded in that guidance range somewhere?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, the allowed returns are back on the slide four, which is 10.7 for the electric business at SCE&G and 10.25 for SCE&G gas, and 10.6 at PSNC in North Carolina. The gas piece, as I discussed, we have made a filing for an increase under our Rate Stabilization Act and we believe one that\u2019s effective later this year, that that will push us back towards 10.25 on the gas business. We remain below the 10.7% on the electric side. I will tell you that we have not contemplated any potential increase in electric rates end of 2012 guidance, so there is nothing added in there for potential increase in revenues. We are watching the economic conditions to see what the recovery does and we\u2019ll certainly pay attention to that and \u2013 works that in more detail in 2012. We did have a moratorium that we received from the commission on our last increase last year, and that would keep us from increasing rates until July 2012. But if you back and look at what we\u2019ve done in history, it\u2019s been about two to three years between regular core increases depending on what the economy is doing.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. Kevin, you touched on my third question, which was any updated thoughts on rate cares? So \u2013 and then I guess just one last thing on the NRC\u2019s process and \u2013 been trying to kind to follow the DCD, what\u2019s your understanding of the time frame or the rough timeframe that the NRC is expecting in terms of ruling on the DCD?", "Kevin Marsh", "I think that the \u2013 if we talk about the Westinghouse AP 1000 DCD in Revision 19, the last revision, the proposed rule went to the Commission I think it was last week, so that\u2019s the staff has basically finished their work and have sent it up to the Commissioner themselves. According to their internal guidelines, they\u2019ve got four weeks to confirm the rule, so we anticipate that could be within the next couple of weeks.", "Erica Piserchia \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Jonathan Reader of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Reader \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Good afternoon. Couple of questions I guess that haven\u2019t been asked yet. One is just kind of a clarification, so if you get the COL in the timeframe you are expecting around year end, you are still going to implement one of those three options under the study?", "Kevin Marsh", "It would be our anticipation that we wrap up the negotiations with the consortium on the options by year\u2019s end and if we get the COL by year\u2019s end to position ourselves to start the nuclear construction right away.", "Jonathan Reader \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "But would you have to implement one of those three options if you get the COL by year end still?", "Kevin Marsh", "We would have to implement one of three options but the early part of \u2013 of all three options is the same.", "Jonathan Reader \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay.", "Kevin Marsh", "Once we start with basement for the first big secure concrete for mud mat, vapor barrier, (reblockage) that\u2019s all the same for any of the options.", "Jonathan Reader \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And then Kevin can you quantify what the EPS contribution is from the polar obligation in Georgia, does that really pull anything to the bottom line?", "Jimmy Addison", "Jonathan, this is Jimmy. Let me respond to that. There is an impact to the bottom line. And I hope you appreciate this, but this is in a bid process now and for competitive reasons I don\u2019t want to disclose that to all of our competitive bidders with any information in that bid process that they don\u2019t already have. Let me just say to you that we\u2019ve \u2013 that\u2019s also contemplated in this guidance range and it\u2019s not material.", "Jonathan Reader \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And then a last question, I think Jimmy you said that 2012 you\u2019re not assuming any industrial growth. Is that accurate?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, we\u2019re assuming industrial growth based on what\u2019s announced to-date. So everything that Kevin covered with you earlier on the slide based on their planned implementations of these facilities and their planned usage, we have built that into our plan. But we have not assumed yet unannounced industrial expansion that we \u2013 that may be in the pipeline.", "Jonathan Reader \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, makes sense. Thanks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yep.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Jim von Riesemann of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Good afternoon.", "Kevin Marsh", "Hey, Jim.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hello.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "How are you guys doing?", "Kevin Marsh", "Great.", "Jimmy Addison", "Great.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "I am a little tired because this is fourth call. So I\u2019m going to beat a dead horse to death if you guys don\u2019t mind. So it looks to me 2011 is probably going to come in above your internal target number barring anything else, right? So you have that. What takes this down to the low end of the 2012 range exactly to get to 305, so you would have like earnings decline? I\u2019m just missing that?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, it really would come back primarily to this discussion around the different options and again\u2026", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay.", "Kevin Marsh", "We\u2019ve given ourselves a little liberty there because we can\u2019t define it completely.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Yeah, okay. So that\u2019s why your internal target for \u201812 is above the midpoint you\u2019ve given yourselves such a low end just in case?", "Kevin Marsh", "Just in case.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Got it. That was easy enough. The COL is issued at the end of the year. Let\u2019s just assume that\u2019s done, everything has signed, sealed and delivered. What\u2019s keeping you and Steve and everybody up in night now because you\u2019ve got from where we get the thing license to like \u2013 now we got to sell the bigger construction project on our hands?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, getting ready for the construction keeps me and my folks up in my\u2026", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Right.", "Kevin Marsh", "We got a lot of work to do preparation wise. Beyond that, I think the outcomes from Fukushima\u2026", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Yeah.", "Kevin Marsh", "Now the 81,000 units were really designed to handle the kind of station blackout that they had over the Fukushima. So, that\u2019s one reason, I think why the NRC in their internal review they put out about 90 days afterwards said that they would support their continued licensing of two designs and the 81,000 as one as of those designs. So we\u2019re hardened by that. I do think that the 81,000 design will handle Fukushima type of issues. But that being said, it could be we get. Some impact from a Fukushima-related issue, I don\u2019t think that that will delay licensing and all, and again, I think the plan is a solid plan. So whatever they come up, well, that would be applicable to the entire fleet in the United States would also be applicable to our new units.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "I think if you guys once you get that fuel oil we don\u2019t like to come down and have another meeting on side of \u2013 if you guys don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m just throwing that out there. The last thing is; the Wall Street Journal has been running a lot of stories about South Carolina and labor laws and everything else. Can you just touch a little bit on that what that might mean for industrial growth and industrial production down there? I think it centers around Boeing?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, I certainly think people are coming to South Carolina for a reason. We got a very positive industrial climate. We have labor supplies and traditionally South Carolina was right to work state. I think we\u2019re less than 5% unionized in the state.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Right.", "Kevin Marsh", "And these are people looking at us. Certainly the issue that\u2019s gotten a lot of attention is the Boeing situation where they\u2019ve got their plant contemplated, not just contemplated, but up and running and they got plants moving through the facility at this point, and I believe the first plants do out of there early next year. So, there are big issues there. I certainly can\u2019t give the little aspect of their case. But generally, the complaints are centered around whether or not they unduly penalize the unions in Washington by expanding the plant down here. But it\u2019s my understanding that the union workforce was not reduced in Washington.", "I think it was slightly increased and this was addition to their facilities, not just a movement of the existing line from there \u2013 from operations out there. So, there\u2019ll be a lot of debate about that. I am sure it\u2019ll go through the legal process. But the reality is we got a plant down here. There has been a tremendous impact of a state. Thousands of people have found employment. I think there\u2019ll other companies that come in around to support their operations. And personally I think it\u2019d be difficult to try to shut it down and send all those people home, which I believe is what \u2013 I believe more to have happened. But I won\u2019t \u2013 somehow as well take place, but that\u2019s really the challenge at hand and what we have got as a plant it is working well and employing a lot of people in a state that\u2019s go ahead to have them and others are coming to join them.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Kevin, that was really helpful because some of these articles are a little \u2013 they\u2019ve got their own agenda. The last question is quite simple. You\u2019ve gotten actual ROE at SCE& of 8.6, your allowed is 10.7. If you get \u2013 if you close that 200 basis point GAAP, what does that do to the earnings power of the company?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, certainly it would boost us, but not change the guidance for next year because we\u2019ve not contemplated anything that might impact next year. We\u2019ve got the moratorium as I said earlier this takes us through July 2012. Any filing that we might make would not be effective until six months after we made that request to the commission. But certainly it will be an upside. What we are watching carefully is seeing what happens with the economy. If we can sustain some of the growth we are certainly interested in average customer usage that number is amassed around as we talk about in several meetings this year. All those are of interest to us and we\u2019ll watch that as we try to make a decision as to whether or not we make a decision to file a case.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Well, is it out of the realm of reasonable miss that you could be close to earning your allowed ROE in say 2013?", "Kevin Marsh", "I think that would contemplate what the economy does and if we have a filing on top of that, certainly if we return to the growth levels we saw in previous years it would move us in a good piece towards that direction.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Got it. Okay, just wanted to make sure. Thanks.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from David (indiscernible) of Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good afternoon.", "Kevin Marsh", "Hello, David.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just I had a couple of questions on 2012, but before that just simply a question, why did you give next year\u2019s guidance today rather than on your Q4 call as you did last year?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well interesting question, that\u2019s typically been our process and our style as to give that at the end of the third quarter is just with since the recession we\u2019ve not felt like we had our hands around it because it\u2019s been inconsistent. We\u2019ve not felt like we had our hands around the range well enough to do it. So we wanted most information possible. We are getting to the point now where we feel like we got more reliability around our projections, we\u2019ve got more insight into them because of the electric weather normalization adjustment and we\u2019re not trying to separate the art from the science as far as what is real customer growth and consumption looking like and we\u2019re just more confident.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Specifically on 2012, what\u2019s the amount of the cash tax savings that you expect? Can you break that out by D&A \u2013 it\u2019s only D&A impact or any other items?", "Kevin Marsh", "It\u2019s about $200 million in total but that really spanned a two to three year period, I believe the benefit in 2012 was something less than $100 million, maybe be less than $75 million but it really is kind of a cumulative impact of that benefit over, over several years. In fact, if you look at our \u2013 look at our financial statements you will see that we\u2019ve really \u2013 we\u2019re starting to turn that now, we are starting to pay current income taxes, so most of that benefit is behind us but there is a small amount next year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And majority of that was at the electric segment, is that fair to say?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, absolutely.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, so based on that, how much rate base growth you see at the electric segment E&G excluding of course the nuclear project, off of your, let\u2019s just take your year in 2010 rate base I think of $4.8 billion. What would you envision the rate base growth in the next \u2013 through 2014?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah. David, I don\u2019t have an objective number in front of me on that. Obviously, the nuclear is going to overshadow it that clip. But I will tell you that generally the way we pull back on CapEx to equalize the economy that it has been fairly close, maybe outpacing depreciation and amortization, maybe $100 million or so but I don\u2019t\u2019 have a specific number in front of me.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thank you so much.", "Kevin Marsh", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Chris Ellinghaus of Williams Capital. Please go ahead.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Williams Capital", "Hi guys.", "Kevin Marsh", "Hello.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Williams Capital", "Just a \u2013 just a follow up on the industrial question, can you give us a little flavor for what\u2019s going on with volume?", "Kevin Marsh", "I mean in terms of their operations there, they\u2019re up and running. They are taking energy from us. They are building planes and we are excited. We are just about ready to complete the solar panel installation or the solar laminate we put on top of their 10 acre roof which is going to produce about 2.6 megawatts of energy. But there are in full operation and are working to keep it at that direction, I don\u2019t think they plan on letting up.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Williams Capital", "Did they suffer any material delays due to the politics locally?", "Kevin Marsh", "Not that I\u2019m aware of. In my conversations with the billing officials they have told us consistently that they have been overwhelmed by the support they\u2019ve had in the state from all the other industry connections as well as all the regulatory and legislative support they needed has been very strong.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Williams Capital", "Okay. And related to the potential for a rate case, does your guidance or I guess not in the guidance but is your internal plan assuming that you\u2019ll file once the moratorium is complete? ", "Kevin Marsh", "We have not made that decision. I\u2019ve just said earlier that we don\u2019t have anything in the 2012 guidance. We\u2019ll wait and see what happens between now and the first half of next year to make a decision, but whether or not we need to file or anticipate the need for rate relief. ", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Williams Capital", "Okay. One more thing Jimmy, can you give us any flavor for what D&A looks like for next year? ", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, I really don\u2019t have that in front of me, I apologize. But its \u2013 I would say just based on what we are putting into CapEx etcetera that it would be fairly consistent with 2011.", "Chris Ellinghaus \u2013 Williams Capital", "Okay great. Thanks so much.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, congrats on a good quarter. One question, first of all, what are you expecting out of earnings outside of SCANA Energy and SCE&G and PSNC in your 2012 guidance, meaning holding company costs as well as the small gas transmission business?", "Kevin Marsh", "Consistent with 2011.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it, okay. Second, do you anticipate issuing any further \u2013 you\u2019ve got a maturity at the holding company level in February. You just going to refi that at the hold co., you\u2019re going to replace that at the operating company, how should we just thinking about kind of the puts and takes on the cap structure at the holding company level?", "Kevin Marsh", "Again consistent. There is a slide back there, slide 15, we are just going to simply refi that right where it is today.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Last question, we talked about this a while ago, when not long after Fukushima the contractors, meaning Westinghouse and Shaw filed a force majeure, I think related to Summer, just curious if there is an update on that, where that stands, how that process plays out from here as well?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah. They did that as \u2013 I would say a routine course of business whenever they have something that goes on anywhere around the world that could impact their deliveries units, they give us one of those type letters. Many of which they end up with sending. The supply chain in Japan, there were really two vendors in Japan that could have been affected one was IHI which is a large manufacturer that\u2019s supplying plate steel for us, and the other one was Toshiba and Toshiba is delivering the turbine condenser, really quite a large number of units. Toshiba largely have not started their work yet, IHI had actually delivered us plate steel in December.", "We got word from both of the vendors that our components that were on site were undamaged. For example, we had some plate steel onsite at IHI, but they were prepping to send us for the ring segment of the containment vessel. That was undamaged and that their facilities were largely undamaged. They did have some minor things that they had to correct. Their bigger issue was with the rolling blackouts, most of the vendors were in the Tokyo area. They have learned to deal with rolling blackouts now and they are in full production as we understand it, and we anticipate no delays from the earthquake impacts in Japan.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Meaning that they are on-time and on schedule for the containment vessel and \u2013 what is it I think the turbine generator?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, turbine generator auxiliary is condenser \u2013 yeah, they are schedule for all that.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. Thanks guys. Much appreciated.", "Kevin Marsh", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Dan Jenkins of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 Wisconsin Investment Board", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Kevin Marsh", "Hi, Dan.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 Wisconsin Investment Board", "Just kind of on the same topic on the nuclear plant construction, and particularly when we look at your slide, I think 14, where you have the CapEx, the new nuclear CapEx laid out, would the 2012 CapEx be impacted much by these various pass that you\u2019re exploring now \u2013 or \u2013 I know what \u2013 you made one comment that a lot of the work would be the same at the beginning, but I was just curious how variable that 2012 CapEx that you might be depending on that?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah. And again, it\u2019s unqualified since our negotiations and discussions with the consortium. We\u2019re not yet complete. There probably would be an impact on CapEx through, I don\u2019t think this is significant impact. Because, as I pointed out earlier, the first let\u2019s say six to eight months of work in the excavation that we\u2019re now allowed to do, once we receive the COL would be the same under any of the scenarios. There may be some more work done outside of the excavation under the first scenario where we try to keep the commercial operation take the same. But we will have a significant amount of work going on really irregardless of which of those scenarios we chose.", "For example, we are going to be assembling modules from subcomponents that come in to decide in a very large building. That work will continue, that\u2019s probably almost years worth of work on the two largest modules. We will continue to assemble the lower bowl assembly for the containment vessel and then the rings once we get the plate steel in for the rings, that work it really will continue irregardless as to which of the options we chose. And then we got some other things to decide that we\u2019re trying to complete water intake, water outfall, cooling tower work that work will all continue and we\u2019re trying to build a water treatment facility that eventually will supply our existing and the two new units and that work will continue. So we got a significant amount of work to do in 2012 really irregardless of the scenario we pick.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then just for \u201812, \u201813, \u201814 since that\u2019s kind of what you laid out, if there are any changes to that, new nuclear CapEx based on the plants would pretty much be an equal change to the financing related to that on slide 15? Is that the way to think about that or is it?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, in theory, now there might be some practical implications to that I mean if we were to increase $130 million do we necessarily increase the debt and the equity $15 million each, I mean within some parameters, I absolutely agree with your comment, it\u2019s just there is some practical implications to that too.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 Wisconsin Investment Board", "Right.", "Kevin Marsh", "In other words we might just use our short-term financing methods as we intend to bridge some of the peaks and valleys and do more economic financing at the debt and equity level.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, thanks. And kind of the last area I wanted to get into a little bit was in the industrial sales, first of all just that the gas industrial was down whereas electrical industrial was up, is there something going on like between customer classes that would explain that or is this just\u2026", "Kevin Marsh", "Interesting question, Dan. That\u2019s really that\u2019s what I asked myself a few days ago the staff and the answer to that is it doesn\u2019t have to do with our core retail gas industrial customers. That has to do with our gas sales through our marketing company principally to other electric generators, not on our system and the weather this third quarter was milder although still above normal, milder than the extremely hot summer in the third quarter of 2010 and so they were running their gas generation less. And so we sold less industrial gas to those \u2013 to those folks for electric generation purpose, but it doesn\u2019t relate to our direct serve industrial customers of our system.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then the last question in that area is have you seen any change in industrial demand and as the quarter progressed then into October given the market volatility and kind of the consumer confidence has come down have you seen any pull back on industrial demand in your service area over the period?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, I can\u2019t comment really on October, I don\u2019t have anything or any details on that with me. But I can tell you through September the real bright spot in this to me as I analyzed it was that we\u2019ve seen increases in all of our larger categories in order of significance to us at least in aggregate chemicals, paper, steel and rubber, all four of those have increased as well as obviously aerospace now with Boeing\u2019s ramping up full speed. So it\u2019s not any one general area, it has really been a good portfolio.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, thank you.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, one another thing I might add is that there was a comment here in the local press this week \u2013 after the last week after the most recent announcement of Continental Tire over in Sumter that followed on the heels of the Bridgestone that Kevin mentioned earlier and of course we got a lot of Michelin manufacturing facilities already in the territory and the projection is that once all these plans come online that South Carolina will produce more rubber products than does Akron in Ohio, the previous rubber capital of the country.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay thanks.", "Kevin Marsh", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium. Please go ahead.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Hi Jimmy. Sorry, entered late on the call. I just wanted to go over, if I\u2019m right, Jimmy on the slides that you presented in the conference in the summer you had talked about additional equity of about $115 million in \u201912. Is that out of the boat now or where does that stand, can I ask?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah we did cover that earlier but would be glad to refresh that if you can look on slide 15 of the slides for today. If you don\u2019t have those now, you can access them later. We do not expect to have to issue that follow-on equity offering in 2012 driven by the cash generated from our tax strategies, both\u2026.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "Deprecation and the change in our expensing of repairs for tax purposes.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay, I apologize. So, does that mean that\u2019s gone out of the system totally, right. That is the way we should look at it, right? It\u2019s not like deferred to 13 or later on right, so it\u2019s like total gone out of the system and a boost for earnings, is that correct?", "Jimmy Addison", "It\u2019s a boost for earnings in the short term because there is no dilution. But if you find that slide 15, you\u2019ll see where it really does, most of it comes back in \u201813 and the balance comes back in \u201814, so it\u2019s a shift of the timing.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "It\u2019s a shift of the timing? So, okay. Okay, I apologize. So, you\u2019re still expecting the 150 additional to be done in \u201813 and \u201814 rather than in \u201812?", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s right.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay, okay. Okay, thank you very much.", "Jimmy Addison", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And finally, we have a follow-up question from Andrew Levi of Caris. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "I\u2019m off that. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I am showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to end the question-and-answer session and turn the conference back over to Mr. Jimmy Addison for closing comments.", "Jimmy Addison \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Well, thank you. And to summarize, we\u2019re very pleased with our third quarter results. Despite the challenging economy, we continue to demonstrate growth in our earnings and in our customer base. Our service territory continues to exhibit significant industrial expansion and our nuclear project continues to move forward on schedule and budget. I want to close today by recognizing the visionary leadership Bill has offered both our company and me personally over his career. Bill has made us all better, significantly better, and for that, as a member of the management team and as a shareholder, I\u2019m very grateful. We\u2019re excited about our future, but also thankful and proud of our past. Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.", "Operator", "And that will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining us.

I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2011.", "Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.

During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2011, and provide an update on our outlook for 2012. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our nuclear project. ", "Let\u2019s start on Slide 3, which reflects SCANA\u2019s 2011 full-year basic earnings per share of 3.01 compared to $2.99 per share in 2010. Increases in electric margin from rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, and lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower gas margins, higher interest, property tax and depreciation expense and share dilution. ", "Our results were within our 2011 guidance of 2.95 to 3.10 per share, and only $0.01 below our internal target of 3.02. The mild weather in Georgia cost us approximately $0.01 in December. ", "I\u2019ll remind you that 2010 includes $0.07 of weather prior to the implementation of electric weather normalization, resulting in weather normalized earnings of $2.92. You can reference the appendix on Slide 18 for a reconciliation from GAAP to weather normalized earnings.", "Slide 4 shows the basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $0.76 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the same quarter of 2010. While operation and maintenance expenses were lower in the current quarter, those benefits were offset by the anticipated cost of our capital program, higher interest, property tax, and depreciation expense along with related share dilution.", "Now on Slide 5, I\u2019d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company\u2019s full-year 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.04 compared to 2010. Improved margins from increases under the Base Load Review Act offset the increased capital related cost.", "For the fourth quarter, SCE&G earnings were $0.02 lower than the same period last year, reflecting the aforementioned increased capital related cost. PSNC Energy\u2019s earnings for 2011, shown in red, were $0.37 per share compared to $0.36 per share in 2010.", "Fourth quarter 2011 earnings were flat over the same period in 2010. Increases in customer growth along with lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expense.", "SCANA Energy, in green, reported lower earnings for the full year 2011, due principally to milder weather. ", "I\u2019m pleased to report that SCANA Energy has again been selected to serve as the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming two-year term, covering September 2012 through August 2014. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program\u2019s inception in 2002.", "SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses reported a 2011 loss for the year of $0.01 per share and earnings for the quarter of $0.01 per share compared to losses of $0.03 and $0.02 per share respectively for 2010. The improvement is due to improved results in our communications business during 2011.", "Slide 6 shows customer growth at our major subsidiaries. We experienced customer growth in our North and South Carolina regulated business, while Georgia, while the Georgia market saw a decrease in customer count over the prior year. We are pleased that our regulated businesses continue to yield organic growth. The reduction in Georgia is due to a loss of customers in our Regulated Provider program, which was partially offset by increased customer count in our deregulated sector.", "Several marketers now have offerings such as a prepay service as an alternative to the regulated provider structure. Additionally, our analysis also shows that customers have been slower to connect their gas service this winter, due to the unseasonably mild temperatures. ", "Our Electric and Gas sales statistics can be found in the press release we filed earlier today and are available on our website. ", "On our weather normalize basis, electric residential sales are up approximately 1%. Industrial sales also saw improvement with an increase of a little more than 1%. Commercial sales continued to lag behind last year with a decrease of approximately 2% when weather normalized. ", "As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, industrial growth typically leads, followed by residential, and then commercial. So it appears that some of the industrial activity in our area over the last couple of years has translated into residential consumption, but we\u2019ve yet to see that in the commercial sector. These results were anticipated in our 2011 plan, and we\u2019ve forecast similar patterns in 2012.", "While we continue to see customer growth, we expect that customer usage will be slightly lower in 2012 as a result of demand side management programs, new lightbulb standards that are being phased in, more energy efficient air conditioners, and general conservation.", "For the year, retail sales of natural gas were lower by 1.6% because of milder weather. The residential and commercial sectors were down approximately 18% and 9% respectively, while industrial sales, which are not significantly impacted by weather increased more than 7%. ", "Of course weather is contemplated in our rate mechanisms in both regulated jurisdictions, so there is no margin impact in the residential and commercial sectors. ", "Fourth quarter brought more industrial announcements in our service territory. On Slide 7, you can see a update of economic expansion plans in South Carolina. During the fourth quarter alone, announced investment exceeded $500 million with the largest coming from a pharmaceutical company that will be located near our corporate campus here in Central South Carolina. These announcements during the quarter suggest the ultimate creation of over 1,900 additional jobs.", "For the full year, total announced investment was over $3.2 billion and more than 7,700 expected jobs. This was the best year for industrial economic announcements in South Carolina in the last decade.", "Unemployment continued to show improvement in the areas we serve. As you can see on Slide 8, we continue to see improvement at the national, state, and local level. At December 31, the unemployment rate in South Carolina was the lowest since 2008, and is now lower than that of North Carolina and Georgia, as a surge of economic development activities begin to take hold.", "Our service territory of South Carolina is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia Metro areas where unemployment is lower than the national average as denoted in the green box. ", "Please turn to Slide 9, which sets forth our regulated returns in South Carolina, regulatory calendar for 2012. The chart at the top shows the earned returns as of September 30, the date of our most recent filings. ", "Our Electric operations earned 8.74% a slight improvement over our June filing, due to margin improvement and cost containment. This figure is exclusive of any new nuclear equip or associated rate increases as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act and earned an 11% ROE.", "As noted on the second line, we have $1.1 billion of new nuclear equip currently in rates. This amount covers spending through June 2011. Subsequent to June, we incurred incremental quip of $156 million that will be considered in our next revised rates filing later this year.", "Many of you have asked if we expect to follow the base electric case in the near-term. While we have not made a decision of when we would file our next case, we typically file on a two-to-three year cycle. One of the stipulations from our last case was that we could not have another increase in base rates for 24 months, or until after the middle of 2012. ", "As we have mentioned previously, our 2012 guidance does not include additional revenue from a base rate increase. We recognize the importance of earning our allowed return, and we will evaluate our position regularly.", "As of September 30, our Gas Business at SCE&G was earning approximately 9.5% after annualizing the impact from the most recent $8.5 million rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act, effective in November. ", "Our North Carolina Gas Business continues to perform well and is earning it\u2019s allowed return, principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. ", "The bottom of the slide includes two time lines depicting our regulatory filings schedule for 2012. Consistent with prior years, we anticipate making our annual gas RSA filing in June, and our annual nuclear BLRA revised rate application in May.", "Yesterday, we filed our most recent BLRA status report with the Commission and Office of Regulatory Staff for the fourth quarter. Steve will address the project fully in a few minutes.", "Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast assumes receipt of our COL in early 2012, and incorporates new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA filing. We have also provided a preliminary estimate of additional owner\u2019s cost related to our nuclear project which Steve will discuss. As you can see, new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our projected CapEx over the next three years.", "Please turn to Slide 11. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014. In January, we completed two of our three planned debt offerings for the year. We issued $250 million in medium term notes at SCANA for a refinancing and $250 million of first mortgage bonds at SCE&G to fund CapEx. We were pleased with the market\u2019s reception to these offerings, with substantial over subscriptions and historically low interest rates, and we remain confident in our ability to raise the funds necessary to complete construction of our nuclear project from public sources.", "We expect an additional issuance of approximately $200 million at SCE&G later in the year. ", "We continue to anticipate to draw the remaining funds from our equity floor during the fourth quarter of 2012. From the beginning, our strategy has been to finance our nuclear project from public sources with 50% debt and 50% equity, and nothing has changed.", "I would also like to touch briefly on our pension assets. I\u2019m pleased to report that our pension plan is adequately funded. We have not had to make a cash contribution to the plan since 1997, and do not anticipate any until at least 2013. Our plan was recognized as one of the best funded among our peers in a recent study by UBS.", "Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on slide 12. We reaffirm our 2012 guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share with an internal target of $3.17, and our long-term outlook to deliver 3 to 5% earnings growth over the three-to-five year period, based on the 2010 weather normalize base of $2.92 per share. We are pleased that our 2011 earnings per share of $3.01 were within \u2013 were in line with our guidance, and essentially at our announced target of $3.02.", "I want to point out that our guidance is based on basic earnings per share. As you have probably noticed, we focus on basic earnings in our discussions with you. In May of 2011, we entered in to an equity forward contract. And to comply with accounting requirements, we present basic and diluted earnings in our financial statements. Basic earnings per share reflect the shares we\u2019ve actually issued during the year. In contrast, diluted earnings per share include the effect of theoretical shares that would have been outstanding if we had issued the shares under the forward contracts, which we didn\u2019t. If our stock price stays above the contract forward price, we expect similar amounts of potential dilution through the fourth quarter of 2012, when we anticipate drawing the remaining funds under the forward.", "At that time, those shares will begin to affect our basic earnings, and are considered in our forecasted share price count and earnings guidance. The diluted commutation is required but is a little consequent in this particular situation as the shares were not issued and can only dilute earnings when issued.", "We continue to forecast 2012 residential customer growth to be in line with 2011, while we believe average customer usage will be slightly lower as a result of continued efficiency efforts. We plan to keep O&M expenses relatively flat over 2011, with modest growth in CapEx-related cost of property taxes, depreciation, interest and share dilution.", "We anticipate weather normalized earnings from our Georgia business will be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 30.28% and we estimate the rate for 2012 will be approximately 31%. ", "Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and the 2011 gas RSA filing, as well as the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies. These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing the remainder of our equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012, and should postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Steve, to provide a update on our nuclear project.", "Steve Bryne", "", "Thanks, Jimmy. I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. At the end of the third quarter, we needed a completion of three items in order for the commission to be able to approve our COL. ", "The first, was completion of a mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission commissioners. This was completed in October. The hearing was uncontested and we believe went well.", "We also needed a 401 Water Quality permit, and this was received in December. Finally, we needed the NRC\u2019s approval of the AP1000 certified design. As you can see in the green section of the chart, the NRC has approved the AP1000 certified design. This approval came on December 22, and the rule was published in the federal register on December 30. The rule became effective immediately upon it being published in the federal register.", "At this point, there are not any remaining steps for us to take in order to receive our license. We were pleased to see the commissions recent affirmation vote to issue southern companies COL. We believe the commission will follow the same process in regards to our license. After the session, the license will be signed and we can proceed with full nuclear construction. We continue to have confidence that our license will be issued early this year. ", "Please turn now to Slide 14, which gives you an overview of some of the activity that is underway at the site. Construction of the heavy lift derrick continues and the attachment of the boom and the back mass to the carriage has been completed. Our control room simulators are being installed, and welding of the containment vessel lower bowl continues to progress well. Construction of the cooling towers continues to move forward as plan; we continue to make progress on construction of the switchyard, as you can see by the picture at the bottom of the slide. The switchyard is scheduled to be energized in March of 2013, which fully supports the nuclear project schedule.", "On Slide 15, you can see an aerial shot of the site from late 2011, which highlights several of the items I discussed. As Jimmy mentioned early, we filed our quarterly status report with the South Carolina Public Service Commission yesterday. This report provided an overview of our project and a discussion of project cost.", "Construction work on the site is proceeding safely and efficiently. The project has met the goal of completing the work necessary to allow the first nuclear safety-related construction to commence onsite, when the COL is issued. The project has compiled a safety record that is unprecedented for a heavy construction site of its size, totalling well over 5 million safe work hours, with only two lost-time instances since construction began over three years ago.", "In the quarterly BLRA filing, we also discussed additional costs that are included in our current estimates, which are described at the top of Slide 16. These cost include increased cost being passed on to SCE&G by Shawn Westinghouse, as a result of the new Federal Healthcare Laws, increased cost for cyber security regulation, incremental cost associated with the design modifications of the water discharge system, and additional forecasted transmission costs.", "In addition to these cost, currently reflected in the recent BLRA filing, we anticipate an increase in perspective owner\u2019s cost of approximately $150 million, related to accelerated hiring and training of staff, along with the cost of facilities, equipment, and information technology to support the nuclear units and associated personnel.", "A portion of these cost expected in 2012 through 2014 was included as a line item on the CapEx forecast Jimmy discussed previously. It is important to note that these cost are preliminary and may change as we refine the estimates by year and cost category. ", "In the coming months, we plan to make a updated cost filing with the public service commission to include these cost in our budget. ", "As you might recall, this filing\u2019s necessary due to the decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court in 2010, which found that previously-approved general contingency cost could not be included in the forecasts approved for the Basic Review Act. Instead, as the proposed use of contingency funds is identified and itemized to specific cost categories, we must file with the PSC for approval.", "I would now like to talk about the COL delay study. When we signed our EPC contract in 2008, it was anticipated that the COL would be issued by the NRC in July of 2011, due primarily to delays in approval of Revision 19 to the certified design, it should now be issued early this year.", "As we have previously discussed, in 2011 we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study, which would provide various cost and timing alternatives arising from this delay in issuance of the COL. ", "The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out commercial operation date for Unit 2 to account for the COL delay, while maintaining the commercial operation date for Unit 3 unchanged.", "The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2, and accelerating the date for Unit 3, in order to take advantage of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. While negotiations are not complete, we have indicated to the consortium that we intend to pursue scenario three.", "Included in negotiations of the COL delay study are all the commercial issues currently on the table.  As mentioned in our February 14 BLRA filing, the consortium has asserted the right to addition cost to recovery under the EPC contract for cost associated with design modifications to the shield building and structural modules, delay in NRC licensing and unanticipated rock conditions. We have not accepted the volatility of those claims. ", "While the parties have not reached an agreement, the upper bond of our portion of the claims is estimated to be approximately $188 million, valued in 2007 dollars. These cost have not been billed to the project. We are still hopeful these claims will be resolved through negotiations. We know that you are interested in the results of our negotiations and we will certainly communicate that information to you, once it is available.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions).

", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Well, we haven\u2019t published an assumed ROE there, but what I did say in my comments earlier is that, you know, we\u2019ve got moratorium on any new rate cases until the middle of the year, and we\u2019ve not included any new revenue in our earnings guidance for 2012.  So our current, most recent published return on the non-nuc is about 8 \u00be.  ", "David Paus \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, got it.  All right, and just on 2011, in the 246 that you earned at SCE&G, how much of that is related to your return on your nuclear investments?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Oh, David, I don\u2019t really have it analyzed that way because you would have to consider, of course, accumulative BLRA increases less the associated debt and equity cost of carrying those increases.  I really haven\u2019t analyzed it that way.  But it will certainly build over the next few years, but it\u2019s not a huge amount at this point.", "David Paus \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, is it fair to say if I just took your average QUIP and I think you\u2019re allowed a 53% equity and 11% return, that should be roughly your earnings from nuclear project?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yes, that\u2019s fair.", "David Paus \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay.  And just on the \u2013 I know it\u2019s only a penny on the pair and another segment, but I know there is some offsetting items in there, could you just give us some color on how that penny breaks out on the CGTC Energy marketing?  I know you mentioned communications was a huge driver in the last year, I believe a lot of that would be offset by I guess just interest at the hold COL level,  Is it \u2013 can you kind of just break those out, break that penny out?  And then\u2026", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yes, we\u2026", "David Paus \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "What do you expect going forward?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yes, I think what you saw this year is a reasonable expectation.  We kind of, you know, we made improvement on it this year.  I expect us to be able to whittle away on that from a net basis and the reason for that being the debt that we renewed is at or below, the existing costs of a debt that is being replaced.  We really don\u2019t have any more debt, refinancing subdued for the next eight or nine years at the hold COL.  So really it\u2019s going to come down to what kind of growth do we see in those smaller subsidiaries and we haven\u2019t in the past broken out the detailed numbers in those subs, but I think they will \u2013 I think it\u2019s reasonable to see that they will grow at least at the level that the major part of the business does.  So I\u2019d expect us to continue to be able to mitigate that interest cost at the holding company through the earnings of other small subs.", "David Paus \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Got it, okay.  And just on your new \u2013 last question, on \u2013 I may have missed this too, but just when do you expect to make that updated filing that you refer to in your quarterly filing last night?

Are we talking months, are we talking \u2013 what\u2019s the \u2013 what kind of color can you give us there?", "Steve Bryne", "", "Yes, relative to the completion date for the first new unit, which for us is unit two, we\u2019re looking to accommodate the delay in receiving the license.  So, what we\u2019ve been talking about with our consortium partners is roughly a six-month delay, so, we are looking at late \u201816 as opposed to, what, April of \u201916, which was the originally BC contract date.

So what we\u2019ve asked them for is what is that ideal split between the units that will save us money, and we think it\u2019s going to come in to be accelerating unit number three by less than a year, but probably somewhere in the 10, 11 month range.

I think they are going to want to have some nuclear portfolio.  I believe they have some stated objectives for a emission-free generation in which they cannot achieve without nuclear.  And then everything else is going to depend on a couple of things.  One, it\u2019s going to be load growth, and secondly, it\u2019s going to be the impacts of EPA rules and regulations on coal facilities.

They\u2019re the reference combined offering a license application, and we are the first subsequent.

They would either be an owner\u2019s cost, or cost that the consortium would pass onto us, but more likely an owner\u2019s cost, and then we would go into the public service commission which we\u2019re roughly planning on doing annually to  update anyway, with an update filing to recover those costs.

Please go ahead. ", "John Ali - Decade Capital", "", "Hey guys, nice quarter.  Just a question, I apologize if you answered this, I joined late.  When you filed for the new build schedule what does that do to 12/13 CapEx?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Well, we've been delayed by, we're running almost eight months now, Steve, beyond what we expected for the COL delivery, seven months or so.  So we've naturally pushed some of the construction that was expected in 2011 into 2012.  So we're kind of pushing that a little bit into another year.  We really haven't changed it a great deal other than the two items Steve outlined earlier, which we the potential owner\u2019s cost increases that were filed in our BLRA yesterday, referenced.  And also, these challenge costs we're negotiating with the consortium. ", "Steve Bryne", "", "So keep in mind that a lot of the capital expenditures we would not intend to change.  For example, we've got a large component being manufactured overseas, things like reactor vessels or steam generators or piping, turbine generators, all those kinds of things.  We would not anticipate changing the schedule for delivery on those, we would like to keep the pressure on those suppliers to hold their original dates.  I would much prefer to store it onsite then to give them another six months in their delivery schedule.  And then we've got another raft of activities that are going on at the site.  For example, the containment vessel itself, which is a very, very large steel cylinder, we are fabricating that right at the site adjacent to our construction project.  And we would anticipate continuing with the fabrication construction of those kinds of items irregardless of which option we would have chosen in that COL delay study.  ", "John Ali - Decade Capital", "", "So the CapEx in 12/13 won't be materially different from what's in the slides today?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "That's right, our best estimate today is in the slide.

And once we have that we will refine the CapEx.", "John Ali - Decade Capital", "", "Okay, but if that were to, if Option 3 were to become official what would you expect the CapEx in \u201911-\u201812 to do?  Or all the changes in kind of like the outer years \u2013 \u201914, \u201815?", "Steve Bryne", "", "Yes, unfortunately I really don't have an answer to that.  That's why we've asked the contractor to give us that answer, we just don't have that.

Last thing, in the BRLA report you all talk a little bit about two issues that we had questions on.  One was some of the QA/QC issues that Shaw Modular Systems in terms of kind of the fabrication of the modules.  And second, the permitting process for some of the water, the NPDEF permits.  Can you just walk us through what some of the issues are and what any concerns you may have and what you're doing to resolve those issues.

Now we have a schedule for receipt of those and as is typical of startup type facilities, they're struggling a little bit with getting their quality assurance and quality control up to nuclear standards.  That is something that we're trying to help them with.  They did have one Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspection in 2011 that was suspended basically because they didn't have enough work going for the NRC to evaluate.  They've subsequently finished that inspection in November of last year.  So they're getting their act together at Shaw Modular Solutions, but as we point out in that BLRA a quarterly filing, it is an area of focus for us, and we SCE&G, are spending a lot of time at that facility.

We have permits that are issued by a lot of different agencies.  The NPEDF is something that should not slow us down.  It\u2019s just that we had anticipated receiving it at one date and we were asked for additional information that really has to do with flows in the Broad River.  And what you do is you evaluate the lowest flow condition over an extended period of time and they wanted us to reevaluate those flows.  So we'll do that and get back to them, but we don't anticipate that's going to have any impact on the project.  ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "", "Got it, okay.

We're going to keep them informed of where we are.  We're going to be considerate of the timing of increases under the Base Load Review Act.  We're going to be considerate of items surrounding our potential fuel hearing and adjustments like that.  So we're really going to try to do anything we can to keep from really pancaking those increases in rates.  And so that's a lot of what goes into the strategy.  And we'd like to get a little more feel for what's coming, you know, how the recovery is economically and how much of a potential margin need, that 200 basis points we're looking at there, how much that might be filled by growth in customers and expansion of the economy as opposed to having to raise the rates on the customers to provide it.  So that's a long answer to say somewhere between the middle of \u201812 and the middle of \u201813.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "", "Got you.  It sounds like it's basically economic and administrative issues.  There's nothing really beyond that.  I appreciate, you know, I'm not asking you to predict when you're going to file and know you have to communicate with your folks there.  But if I'm just to categorize it, it sounds like it's economic issues and then more administrative timing around rate cases.  ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "I would agree.  I mean, it's a matter of when, not if.  And when you have a business like this that's subject to inflationary pressures and you only have increases periodically you've got to go back and you can't just absorb those costs, although we've done a good job of handling the cost over the last five years or so.  ", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "", "Great.  and then last question, I didn't think, maybe I missed it, when do you expect Westinghouse Shaw to come back to you with the re-cut costs as a result of the COL delay study, and your selection, or at least leaning towards scenario three?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "The first thing we need to do is conclude on negotiations with the consortium on the validity of those costs, which we have not accepted.  So I don't know whether it would be a month, six weeks, two months, something along those lines, but I would imagine it's somewhere in the next couple of months we ought to have both a new construction schedule, milestone schedule, and a CapEx forecast.  ", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "", "Got you, but if you're just getting that in sort of a three-month timeframe it might be, is it fair to say that it might be a bit of a stretch to assume it would be in the next BLRA filing and that it might be a second from now?  So not the May, but the August?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yes, I really think that depends a lot on the negotiations.  I think the consortium is certainly capable of turning around within a month or two, it just depends on how else they're going to follow that if they know that we're still in negotiating with them.  But at some point they have to give us that new schedule and if we decide to forgo the negotiations and go to some other kind of dispute resolution then they would give it to us based on what they know at the time.  And then they would have to rectify that when the dispute resolution played out.  ", "Steve Bryne", "", "And let me just add, if we are successful in negotiations, which we sure hope everyone can reach a negotiated settlement on all of this, you won't necessarily have to wait until a quarterly BLRA filing to get that information.  If it happened in between those, as it likely will, we might end up just doing a briefing for the commission of having it in a special update filing with them.  ", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "", "Okay, fair enough, but just so I understand the cadence, you would get something back from them?  Again, you've finished your negotiations, then you get something back from them, there's some internal analysis that you're doing.  You not, I think you've said several times here, you've not decided on scenario three, you'd be looking at those.  So if you got those costs or got that information from Westinghouse Shaw, you know, two days before BLAA filing it's not going to be in that BLRA filing, I assume it's going to be, again as you pointed out Steve, pushed out into either a special briefing or the following BLRA filing?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yes, unless it was, the BLRA, the quarterly BLRA updates are really due 45 days after the end of the quarter.  So if there was something that was that material that happened in that interceding 45 days, again, depending on when those 45 days had transpired we might be able to put it in that previous BLRA quarterly update.

This one, I think I missed, I think you answered already, but the 188 million, that would just flow through the BLRA or you\u2019d have to actually have \u2013 actually, not the BLRA, that would have to flow through a separate filing, right, is that correct?

", "Steve Bryne", "", "We\u2019d haven\u2019t broken that down just because we\u2019re still in negoiations with the consortium so we wanted \u2013 they had asked to \u2013 for us to include all of these things that were open items on the table at the time we wanted to negotiate the COL Delay study, and so we\u2019re going to respect their \u2013 the negotiating process of both parties.  We put the bond on it, but I don\u2019t want to break it out just yet. ", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.", "And I guess what I\u2019m a little confused about, maybe you guys are too, is I guess part of the delay, I mean, bedrock is bedrock, but wasn\u2019t part of the delay because of the design certification taking longer on Westinghouse\u2019s part? ", "Steve Bryne", "", "Yes.  I guess that\u2019s kind of part of the negotiation.  That\u2019s the reason for the dispute.  ", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.", "Okay, I hear you on that one.  Okay, and then on the modules, can you give us any specific, like which pieces or which parts that are being constructed had issues?  ", "Steve Bryne", "", "Well, the modules are largely structural modules that form the buildings of the new plant and these will be modules that generally are going to go in the inside of the containment vessel and outside that form parts of the auxiliary building, fuel handling building, those kinds of things.  They have had to redesign a number of those based on their discussions with the NRC Regulatory Commission around DCD Revision 19.  So it really is \u2013 their claim anyway is that they NCR Regulatory Commission, to satisfy them, they\u2019ve had to make changes to this design.  So that, you know, without getting into specifics, so we\u2019ve got a number of modules; the first one, for example, we expect to show up on site, it\u2019s a module that\u2019s called CA20, which is a relatively large, it weighs about 2 million pounds, it\u2019s about the size of a 7-story building.  We\u2019ll get that in 72 different subassemblies and we will put it together on site.  But it\u2019s those 72 subassemblies to CA20 being fabricated at the SMS facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  They\u2019ve had t make some changes to those structural modules; supports, materials, those kinds of things.  ", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.", "Okay, and then I guess as you kind of look at your EPC contract with Shaw, is there any other things that we kind of just need to keep an eye out for over the next couple of years that could arise similar to the claims that were made by Shaw on the 188 million, I mean, whether it\u2019s bedrock or other type of things or is that kind of unpredictable?  ", "Steve Bryne", "", "Well, it\u2019s unpredictable but I think a lot of those are probably bias.  For example, you know, you take core bores to try to characterize what the bedrock looks like underneath, you know, between 20 and 40 feet of earth, and this one depression in the bedrock just happened to be between two core bores.  So you know, that\u2019s something that Shaw could not have known about, so that is probably more legitimate than anything else.  They\u2019re going to take some concrete and fill that in, is really what the issue is there. ", "With regard to the change that they\u2019ve had to do, the design changes they\u2019ve had to do to things like the modules, with the approval of the certified design for the AP1000 Revision 19, which came in December, they are past those design issues.  So I would anticipate that those kind of things would be far less significant going forward as a certified design is approved.  ", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.", "Okay, thank you, guys.

And Jimmy, can I just ask you, the \u2013 now, of course, having known where you are in 2011, which you said you came exactly around your target, and with decoupling and with the BLRA and with the, if I\u2019m right, would you tell us on Slide 9, right, there are no regulatory things to do in 2012, right, except for the BLRA filing.

Right?  Is that a fair thing? ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yes, I think that\u2019s fair.  As I said earlier, I mean, that\u2019s really simplifying the calculation.  I had not thought about it like that before, but I think that\u2019s fair.  It should be covering the debt one for one, right?

All my questions have been answered except just \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this, when we talk about customer usage, I know there was some weather impacts for the year and stuff, but just what are you seeing there?  How has that been changing?  I know the unemployment rate seems to be getting better and what have you, but what are you \u2013 can you just give us a little bit of a flavor as to what you\u2019re seeing? ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yes, for the year as a whole, \u201911 versus \u201910, weather normalized usage for residential and industrial was up less than 1% but commercial was down a couple of percentage.  As I said in my comments earlier, you know, industrial has got to lead, there have to be jobs out there for folks to have confidence to start spending money at home.  And then that\u2019s got to translate ultimately into more commercial business.  So I think we\u2019re seeing that on the industrial and residential side, but it\u2019s not translated to the commercial side yet.  To me, the kind of wild card in this, we saw this impact several years ago, I think for our industry is what happens to gasoline prices this summer.  I heard a report this morning that gasoline prices could hit an all-time high this summer.  And if they do, that\u2019s money straight off of the discretionary income of every household.  And that can have a significant impact, that can cause a concern over demand.  You know, I hope those reports don\u2019t prove to be true, but certainly, as natural gas has come down, we\u2019ve not seen \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the inverse of that in petroleum.

You know, they were up 20%.  I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the particular, you know, is that driven by chemical or new \u2013 a new plant coming on, or you know, that seems like a pretty big jump in the quarter. ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Well, some of that\u2019s in transportation.  I mean, when customers that buy interrupt gas, if they, you know the price of natural gas coming down like it has, when they had the opportunity to run on alternate fuels, and they can switch to natural gas, they\u2019re switching.  In addition to that, we\u2019ve got customers that are calling us now that do not operate on natural gas that are interested in getting natural gas supply in the future because of the low price compared to their current fuels.  So I just think you\u2019re seeing that really driven off the price of natural gas, you\u2019re just seeing much more driven off that. ", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin ", "Well, is that something then that going forward, you think we\u2019ll be dependent on the price \u2013 the gas prices as opposed to just based demand in the service territory or how should we think about that?

I mean, I think certainly the economy as a whole and what they need to produce in their relative businesses, it\u2019s going to drive \u2013 obviously drive their production.  Then the price of gas compared to their other choices of fuel is going to drive which choice they make in their fuel source.  So I really don\u2019t think you can separate the two although they\u2019re \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can say it\u2019s just one over the other, both are included.

", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin ", "Okay, and then the last thing I was curious about was, you know, you saw 6% - I mean, a $0.06 pickup based on the lower O&M in the quarter.  I wonder if you could give a little more color on what drove that and if that\u2019s the way to expect going forward? ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Well, we\u2019ve had a constant focus on cost control, significantly stepped up during this recession. I think we\u2019ve really got our hands and our culture around that.  I think our \u2013 if you look over the last several years, it\u2019s not just a quarterly trend, but the fourth quarter there was a fairly significant number there.  Frankly, some of that was driven by some of our incentive comp that\u2019s earnings driven.  We did not hit our internal target, so we did not \u2013 we will not be paying out a portion of that related to that incentive.   Some of our incentive comp is driven by the performance of the stock, did not reach targeted levels.  Frankly, after Fukushima, the stock took quite a shot, so we did not hit some of those.  So some of that is related to the accruals or incentive comp, but they\u2019re just a hodgepodge of other items in there too.

Are we still under 5% annual rate increase? ", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Yes.  I think that\u2019s in the ballpark.  I mean, of course that\u2019s also dependent upon what kind of change in the CapEx there is as a result of these negotiations, as a result of the COL delay study of delaying the first new unit and accelerating the third new unit.  We\u2019ve got to get all of that information form the consortium before we really understand that and the impact on rates.  ", "But overall, we originally, when we originally filed for the approval of the plants and they were approved, we\u2019re projecting about a 2 1/2% average increase and now it\u2019s less than that, principally because of inflation being less than we expected.  So yeah, it\u2019s going to \u2013 by pushing these out and compacting the period, it\u2019s definitely going to drive up the peak, but the average increase is lower than we originally projected because the overall cost is lower than we originally projected.

And just to summarize, we\u2019re very pleased with our results for 2011, which were in line with our guidance and we\u2019re optimistic about 2012.  Our nuclear strategy continues to move forward as expected in all areas with the progress of construction and licensing to execution of the plant financings and the BLRA increases each year.

Thank you for standing by. My name is (Amily) and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, May 3, 2012. Anyone who does not consent to this taping may drop off the line at this time.", "I would like to turn the conference call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron Hinson \u2013 Director, Financial Planning and Investor Relations", "Thank you. I'd like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know earlier today, we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2012.", "Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. The slides and the earnings release that we'll refer to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that maybe made during today's call, which are not statements of historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are shown on slide two and discussed in the company's SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Finally, as noted on slide two, we will disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the slides used in conjunction with this call.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Byron and thank you all for joining us today. During today's call, I will discuss our financial results and economic activity for the first quarter and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our nuclear project after which we will respond to your questions.", "As shown on slide three, basic earnings per share were $0.93 for the first quarter of 2012 versus $1 in 2011. Increases in electric margin from rate increases under the Base Load Review Act were more than offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to significantly milder weather, higher operating and maintenance expenses and the costs of our capital program, interest expense, depreciation, and share dilution.", "According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this winter was one of the warmest in over 100 years. Our gas margins in Georgia were impacted by $0.06 due to milder than normal weather and an additional $0.02 compared to the colder than normal quarter in 2011 for $0.08 total. Additionally, although the electric WNA mechanism largely mitigates the impact of weather on electric margins, certain weather-sensitive load is not subject to the mechanism, churches and schools as an examples. So, there can be some earnings impact during extreme weather periods such as this quarter. As a result, SCE&G's electric margin was negatively impacted by $0.01 of abnormal weather this quarter. As an aside, it would have been down $0.14 without the WNA mechanism.", "Now, on slide four, I would like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's 2012 first quarter earnings per share denoted in blue were flat compared to the first quarter of 2011. Electric margin was $0.07 higher due to increases under the Base Load Review Act, net of the $0.01 weather decline. This increase in margin was offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, interest expense and depreciation, as well as share dilution. Total weather-normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were relatively flat over the first quarter.", "Industrial sales were down approximately 2% due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire. We understand this customer's production will likely be limited for the majority of the year. PSNC Energy's earnings for the first quarter of 2012 shown in red were $0.24 per share compared to $0.25 per share in 2011. Increases in customer growth were slightly more than offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses and share dilution.", "SCANA Energy in green reported lower earnings for the first quarter of 2012 due to the aforementioned milder weather. In the first quarter of 2011, weather increased SCANA Energy's margins by $0.02. However, the extremely mild weather in the first quarter of 2012 resulted in an $0.08 swing in margins.", "Next, I would like to touch on economic trends in our service area as shown on slide five. We continue to see business growth and expansion. In the first quarter, companies announced plans to invest $124 million with expectations of creating over 200 jobs in our South Carolina territory. Our gas businesses in North Carolina also saw a promising quarter of economic announcements with companies projecting investment of $194 million and over 2,900 jobs. These announcements covered a variety of industries such as plastics, metals, and food and beverage. As I have mentioned previously, 2011 was an excellent year in terms of economic announcements and we are pleased that this trend appears to be continuing. Another measure \u2013 container volume at the Port of Charleston also continues to improve.", "Volume during March of this year was the highest since October 2008. First quarter of 2012 volume was 7% higher than the first quarter of 2011. We continue to be encouraged by the trend in unemployment rates particularly in the areas we serve as all three states along with the national rate decreased in December \u2013 since December. Our service territory in South Carolina is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia metro area where the average rate has fallen to 7.3%, 90 basis points below the national average.", "This recent industrial expansion has obviously translated into jobs. The chart in the bottom left of the slide shows customer growth at our major subsidiaries. We continue to experience customer growth in all of our regulated businesses while our Georgia market saw slight decrease in customer count over the prior year likely due to the mild weather. We are pleased that all of our regulated businesses continue to yield organic growth.", "Please turn to slide six which set forth our regulated rate base, returns, and South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on the slide represents information as of December 31, 2011, the date of our most recent regulatory filings. As you can see in the pie chart on the left side, our regulated rate base of $7.1 billion is composed largely of SCE&G Electric with closed to $6 billion in total electric investment denoted in blue. The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period.", "Our earned return at the electric business continues to lag behind our lab return despite our cost containment efforts, although, it improved slightly over the last two quarters. Many of you have asked about the potential base rate electric filing to address this deficit. While we have not made any final decisions we are considering filing a Notice of Intent later this month to initiated the regulatory process timeline. We are requiring to file the notice at least 30 days prior to the filing of a case.", "Again the decision around the timing and amount of this filing is not yet named. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina continue to earn steady returns as you can see from the chart. Of course, the South Carolina gas business will adjust under the RSA mechanism if it falls more than 50 basis points below the allowed return. The bottom of the slide includes the two timelines depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012, which we shared with you previously.", "Since our last earnings call, we've completed our electric fuel cost preview and we expect to file our integrated resource plan at the end of May. Later this month, we will file the quarterly status report and annual revised rates request related to the new nuclear project. In addition to these regular BLRA filings, we will be withdrawing our petition to update costs and schedules dated February 29. Simultaneously, we will be filing a new petition updating costs and schedules we previously filed as well as updating the filing for the impact of the issuance of our sea well and to incorporate the $138 million resulting from our preliminary agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes. This will align all of our known nuclear costs in one petition. All of these nuclear filings will be made available on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Slide seven presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA filing in February, which included amounts as of the fourth quarter of 2011 along with the additional cost we disclosed in February. This slide does not include the additional amounts related to our negotiations with Shaw and Westinghouse, which Steve will discuss in more detail. It also does not include any revisions to the schedule from the shifts and timing of the planned dates the plants will come online. The consortium is updating the forecast now and we expect to present the updated data in our BLRA filing later this month and in our Analyst Day on June 5.", "Please turn to slide eight, this slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014 and has not changed since our last earnings call. We continue to anticipate an additional debt issuance later in the year and expect to draw the remaining funds from our equity forward in fourth quarter of 2012.", "Please turn to slide nine, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. Our long-term outlook is unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the three to five-year period based on the 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share. We have adjusted our expectation of earnings from our Georgia business to consider the impact of weather during this quarter. Additionally, we've considered with our guidance the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and gas RSA adjustment. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was just over 30% and we estimate the rate for 2012, will be approximately 31%.", "I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Steve Byrne \u2013 Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Jimmy. I'd now like to direct your attention to slide 10. We are pleased as Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued the combined construction and operating licenses for our two new nuclear units bringing the licensing proceedings at the NRC to conclusion. We have given the consortium of full notice to proceed and are moving forward with nuclear safety-related construction.", "As you can see on slide 11, we have been making significant progress at the site even prior to the issuance of our COL and this picture is from February of 2012. Switchyard shown at the bottom of the slide continues toward completion and is scheduled to be energized in the first half of 2013. Foundations for the cooling towers are progressing as planned, welding of the containment vessel lower bowl continues, the Unit 2 excavation sites for both the nuclear island and the turbine island are ready for concrete to be poured. In the center of the picture, you can see the heavy lift derrick. This derrick has a 560 foot long boom and rotates 360 degrees on rails.", "It will be used to lift assembled modules and other heavy components and place them in the excavation sites of both units. Since this photo was taken and after the receipt of our COL, we have begun pouring concrete in the excavation for Unit 2. Over the next few months, we will complete placing leveling concrete, install the waterproof membrane, pour the mud map and lift and set the nuclear island rebar cage.", "Rebar cage was made in several sections with lifting process installed to allow fabrication before the COL issuance. After that, we will pour the nuclear island base map, which will be approximately six-feet thick. At this point, we'll be ready to set module CR10 on the base map. CR10 is a steel frame support used to hold the lower though above the base map until the foundation concrete is completed.", "Once that concrete is complete, we will set the lower containment bowl. Please turn now to slide 12. As we announced at the end of March, we have signed a preliminary agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse related to challenged cost for the construction of our new nuclear units. As you might recall, these costs related to four items. The first was on unanticipated raw conditions.", "During the excavation for Unit 2 an unanticipated crevice was discovered. This will be filled in with additional concrete. The second challenged cost related to a delay in receipt of the COL. When we signed our EPC contracts in 2008, it was anticipated that the COL would be issued by the NRC in July of 2011. Due primarily to delays in approval of Rev 19 to the certified design and became evident that the COL would not be issued until early 2012.", "In anticipation of this, we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study, which provided various cost and timing alternatives arising from this delay in issuance of the COL. After reviewing the results of their study, we opted to delay the commercial operation date of Unit 2 to 2017 and accelerate the date for Unit 3 to 2018 in order to take advantage of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule and thereby mitigate some of the cost of the initial COL delay.", "Originally, the commercial operation dates were scheduled for 2016 and 2019. The other two channels cost related to design modifications, to the shield building and structural modules. On our last earnings call, we communicated that we believe the upper bound of SCE&Gs portion of the cost would be approximately $188 million valued in 2007 dollars. After negotiations, we agreed to an amount of $138 million.", "As Jimmy mentioned previously, these amounts will be reflected in the cost schedules presented in our upcoming filing with the South Carolina Public Service Commission and discuss in detail at our Analyst Day in early June. We will also continue to provide updates on the progress of construction at the site to our quarterly mining reports with the commission.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond any questions you might have.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Thanks. Good morning. Good afternoon rather. Can you give us a sense for some of the key issues you\u2019ll be addressing in the IRP when you file later this month? Obviously, the nuclear plant will have a key impact, but anything else, gas prices, power prices, stuff like that impact your plans?", "Jimmy Addison", "The IRP is intended to outline where we think the system is going and growing and what our plants will do to help meet that need. It also will forecast the demand side management impacts on load. So, there will not be a significant discussion about the price of natural gas. Rather, what you\u2019ll see is charge a lot when nuclear plants come on. It will also discuss some level of plant retirement, as it has done for the last couple of IRPs.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Has anything changed materially since your last one that was suggest needing either new generation or needing more retirements, leading to more retirements?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, First off the IRP has not been published yet. I think (indiscernible) scheduled date to publish at the end of this month, so I don\u2019t want to get out in front of the IRP with any changes.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "", "Sure, okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim von Riesemann of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Yeah.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, good morning Jim. Jim go ahead. ", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "", "Are you there? Hello, hello.", "Jimmy Addison", "Jim, we can hear you, can you hear us?", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "I can hear you. You can\u2019t hear?", "Jimmy Addison", "You\u2019re cutting in and out.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay. The question really is on just a modeling question, if you don\u2019t mind. Can you just talk about your trailing 12-month like I am coming up at 292 and what some of the drivers are to get it to your 317 internal number for the year?", "Steve Byrne", "I have not looked Jim at the trailing 12 months through Q1 but as far as the 317 we issued that the original range backup I think at the third quarter call back in October and then as we\u2019re refined our plan for this year we reaffirmed that, and are reaffirming it today in spite of the $0.06 of weather versus normal that we lost in Q1 in Georgia. I think our keys to achieving that are to continue our aggressive cost control that we\u2019ve had in place now for several years. We see the possibility of a small rate stabilization increase this fall, that\u2019s not final yet, but that looks like there is some possibility of that, that would impact SCE&G gas business.", "You might remember our original assumptions we didn\u2019t have anything in the plan for that. It looks like we may be able to likely differ the first mortgage bond financing that we have - we had scheduled for in the middle or so, the second quarter. We may be able to push that out a few more months just because of the original delay from the NRC. We also had planned to do the original issuance that we did in January, a little earlier in the month, that occurred later in the month. And also the rates on those various financings that we had in our plan are higher than we realized in January and higher than we project now on the one later this year. So, those are some of the keys to how we think will make up what we realized there as a loss in the first quarter in the weather margins.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Switching to Georgia retail for just a second, can you just talk about some of the experiences you are seeing with your customers there, I don't know how much of its weather, how much of it has to be the change in the gas prices etcetera and what the outlook is there?", "Steve Byrne", "Well, we really don't see the outlook change from what we got it earlier. We really think it's a $0.22, $0.24 kind of business\u2026", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay.", "Steve Byrne", "On an annual basis, on a weather normal basis. Of course, we had the most unusual weather here that we have had in probably in over 100 years this past quarter. So, we don't see a lot of difference there. Now, for the market as a whole and for our business, more customers are on the fixed rate plans as opposed to the variable plans and those just have smaller margins with them.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Then I guess the last question is just a real more holistic question, but with respect to the news build at summer now, now that you have the COL and you can actually really turn pour concrete and turn the spades etcetera, what's keeping you up at night there?", "Steve Byrne", "Let's keeping us up at night. Things at the site actually are going fairly well. Obviously, it impacts the construction are going to be things like weather. We have had good weather so far. So, as long as we get good weather we will keep moving. We have had good interactions with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission so far. Getting a license was a big deal for us. But as I think you found out in the southern disclosures in their last call, there are some issues that are going to come up that are regulatory in nature from now to the end of this project and working our way through those is going to be very important to us.", "So far, I am pleased to say that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is living up to its obligations and so we need to do the same thing. You have seen an issue with reinforcing bar or rebar that's going in the \u2013 for the base map at Southern's. Obviously, we would be coming under that same issue. We are just a little behind them. So, we have perhaps a little bit more time to get to resolution than they did, so it's a little more urgent for them, but those kinds of things are going to come up a lot of more normal course of business things. This is a new license process. So, when you got things in the certified design that perhaps don't make a 100% sense to implement in the field we got to be able to work our way through those.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Right. So, I guess my takeaway is that it sounds like it still remains just a big old construction project. I don't think you say anything negatively about supply chain or anything, so it's just status quo otherwise?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah, so far we have been very pleased with the supply chain and we obviously had some concerns with the \u2013 little over a year ago with the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that some of our materials and components are coming from Japan, but those deliveries have been coming. So, we haven't experienced any supply chain issues from Japan fortunately.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay, great. Thanks for the questions or the answers please.", "Steve Byrne", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Hi, good afternoon. Jimmy, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about O&M, it was up in the quarter yet you talked a little bit about your cost control plans for the balance of the year and maybe talk a little bit about what happened in the first quarter and then how we are going to think about that going through the balance of this year?", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure. Well, we still remain firmly committed to managing the O&M for the year to a level that's similar to 2011, some of the timing of expenses they have to occur when the operations obviously drive them. In Q1 of this year, couple of examples like you've asked for, we had a combustion inspection at one of our combined cycle gas units that was not in the comparable quarter from the year before, so that occurred in Q1. We are running those plants a great deal now. So, you've got to do the inspections. That's not something that occurs each quarter. So, that's more cyclical, if you will.", "We have moved \u2013 changing gears on you moved into healthcare plans, high deductible plans. We have encouraged employees to consider those. Last year, 2011 was the first year. We had about 20% of the employees to adopt the plan last year voluntarily, I was one of those. This year, about 50% have adopted it. As part of that transition, we, the corporation puts seed money into their HSA accounts to help encourage them to move to this to carry the cash flow in the early part of the plan. So, we obviously funded all of the seed money upfront.", "Later, as we move through the year, we think we will see that level out. So, healthcare was up about $0.01 per share. And then, you may remember last year, I commented that due to two items, one, us lowering our long-term earnings guidance to 3% to 5%, and two, Fukushima, our stock took quite a hit in the early part of the year. And as a result, we were substantially below several of our equity based incentive comp plans. So, the stock has performance much better this year, so there's about a $0.01 due to that. So, some of those things are kind of our timing type matters that we don't expect are really linear throughout the year. We are comfortable with saying we're going to manage hard to get towards a flat O&M year-over-year.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "", "That's great. Thanks for the clarity. And then similarly on residential usage, I know it's hard to view through the weather normalization mechanism, but just sort of highlight what the trends you're seeing there, and if we are seeing any pinch of a reprisal in some growth there?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "Well, you are exactly right when you say it's hard to view. My short answer to it is it's just shop and I've commented on that last year that we've seen a couple of good quarters but that doesn't trend make this year in the first quarter commercial was up close to 3%. It looks like early announce looks like residential was down close to 3%, but that's just one quarter and it just doesn't make a lot of sense to try to analyze it on a long-term basis.", "Year-over-year 2011 compared to '10 it was up slightly over 1% for residential. So, we still see good industrial growth on the system. We see good unemployment numbers coming down fairly significantly with our electric territory falling well below the national unemployment rate, almost one full percent. So, we think the long-term trend is good, but trying to look at these usage rates on a quarterly basis is pretty difficult, draw any conclusions.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "", "Got you. So you're still remaining somewhat conservative there from a sales forecasting perspective and I'm talking specifically on the residential class?", "Jimmy Addison", "", "We are.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, great. And then lastly, Steve I was open you could talk a little more about the base mat rebar issue that\u2019s other is identified and just sort of what your understanding of it is and then to a fairly granular degree, if you don't mind and then how it would impact you, they seemed unwilling to be talk about whether it was a warranty or actually an issue with the installation versus the plan, and I'm trying to understand how it impacts you all?", "Stephen Byrne", "Okay. It's not an installation issue within, with no problem with the installation. The issue came out with the design certification document identified specifications for how the rebar cage would be constructed. During our constructability reviews the constructor said this is going to be difficult and went back to the designer and said could we do it a different way. The designer looked at and said yes those drawings were amended and went to the field. So, within the field was constructed in accordance with the drawings. However, the drawings were not as the original design certification drawing was.", "And you have options with changing some of the designs, but it's what the DCD would call a Tier 1 or Tier 2 star kind of a detail. You need to get pre-approval to make those kinds of changes and the position of the vendor was, this was a Tier 2 issue, which means that they could have made those changes, the position of the regulators was now to Tier 2 star issues, so you need to get pre-approval, and that's where the rub comes in. That slight differences between the Vogel project and our project, that Vogel got a limited work authorization, so they actually are ahead of us on the work in the excavation.", "So, they were at the point where they had poured all their preliminary concrete, if you will, down concrete to leveling that, the mud mat, vapor barrier, and they were installing the rebar cage. In our situation, we are just starting on that dental concrete in the Unit 2 excavation and we're moving on to the leveling concrete, and we're building the rebar cage outside of the excavation in order to say some time. And then, we've our intention was to lift the rebar cage with the big derrick, so we've installed lifting lugs in ours. So, we're doing it outside, they were doing it inside the excavation. So, we don't actually need that rebar cage until we're finished with all of that preliminary concrete work, which is going to be a couple of months yet. So we\u2019ve got some time to deal with the issue.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Got you. But just to be specific, is designing or building the rebar cage outside of the pit allow you to build it in line with the specs in the DCD or is it still going to have to be changed and then the dispute will be again whether its Tier 1, Tier 2?", "Jimmy Addison", "The resolution to the issue, let me be clear, ours was built the same way that Southern was going about their construction. So, the resolution to the issue yet has to be determined. We think we will determine which path going forward will be \u2013 we should decide that in the next week or so but is there going to make a change, we are more unlikely going to make the change the difference is they are making it inside the excavation while we are doing it outside the excavation but we got some options we are weighing the options and fortunately we are not at the point yet where we need that rebar cage.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "So, you wouldn't be happy to be behind them, but you are. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Paltz of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon guys.", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "Good afternoon David.", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Just switching to guidance your 2012 guidance how much of that comes from earnings from your new nuclear investments?", "Jimmy Addison", "How much of the 317 our internal target?", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Yeah.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve got that \u2013 David, as we really got it \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t know if you are asking incrementally for this year because really you\u2019ve got full increases now that have occurred over the last four years that are built into that. This year, of course, we\u2019ve got the full year of the increase under the BLRA that was implemented last November and then we would have another two months of the increase that would go in this November.", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Alright. But then maybe the AFUDC earnings that you get on the investments?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah I just got \u2013 I mean I got your question. I just don\u2019t have an answer for that. Sorry.", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Fair enough. Then, just if we look at your long-term growth rate of 3% to 5%, what earned returns on equity are you assuming on your base electric business, excluding the new nuclear?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, we don\u2019t\u2026", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "I mean range will be fine.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, we build you might imagine, we build the model differently than you do. We build it kind of bottom up. I think many of you guys understandably start from the top and look at our earned return and back into that way. We build it a different way. But I would say, to answer your question, within historical test year, when we implement the rates in the base electric business now this is not new nuclear, that\u2019s as you understand a different mechanism. But on the base electric business, once you implemented, you\u2019re probably going to be 50 basis points behind the allowed return. And then now, you see from the slide in the presentation here, we\u2019re a couple of hundred, a little less than a couple of hundred basis points under that allowed return. So, you\u2019re generally starting off a little lower than that allowed return, 50 basis points or so, and I think that some of the consideration that the commission allows in setting the ROEs is they understand with this historical test year. And with the six month, seven month with the notice period minimum process, I mean there is going to be some attrition, if you will.", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Alright, okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "So, we don\u2019t really start on in that way and say, what\u2019s the estimated allowed return. We look at the plant rate base CapEx, etcetera, and build it from bottom-up.", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Got it. But effectively, based on the regulatory structure there, you have about 50 basis points of under-earnings on a structural basis?", "Jimmy Addison", "If you\u2019re looking at the actual allowed, that\u2019s right. Now, the wildcard in all that is, any change in the economy and growth. Now that assumes a static economy - economy of course, when it slowed down, it contributed to accelerating that and presumably when it speeds up again it will mitigate that.", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Right. In your sales graph I believe you said in past calls as long-term sales graph is 1%?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right.", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "And then just last question on the challenged costs I know you guys are going to update that. But just for our purposes should we think of those costs being allocated to near-term CapEx or would it be allocated uniformly across the project timeline?", "Jimmy Addison", "We would allocate them in general across the timeline. Now, some of those costs since are disputed and may have been spent maybe buyer towards the front-end of the project. But in general, we're looking to spread them over the project.", "David Paltz \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Great, thank you so much.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Godby of Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Chris Godby \u2013 Stephens", "Yeah, good day everyone. Given the light results in the first quarter and maintained guidance, how should we think about revenue and earnings distribution over the remainder of the year \u2013 for the coming quarters?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. So, I think we discussed this on our third quarter call that may have been at the beginning of the year and I know you're kind of new to the count. But generally our earnings are distributed about 30% in Q1 and Q4 and about 15% in Q2, 25% in Q3. So, that's kind of generally how they fall out.", "Chris Godby \u2013 Stephens", "Sure, sure we understand that. But kind of thinking about with the first quarter being a little bit light do you anticipate kind of change in that distribution or are you unable to kind of comment on that?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I don't anticipate changing it. That was an abnormal weather in the first quarter. So, I would say, as I've said our internal target was 317, take this \u2013 we can take these same percentages and apply to that and get fairly close to our internal plan.", "Chris Godby \u2013 Stephens", "Okay, okay, that's great. Thank you very much.", "Jimmy Addison", "Right, I mean the abnormal weathers behind us. We don't presume that's going to happen each quarter from here on.", "Chris Godby \u2013 Stephens", "Sure, okay. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from (indiscernible). Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "My question has been answered. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Good morning and good afternoon, excuse me.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Just, sorry, if I missed this, I'm not really clear. What was the weather normalized growth that you guys are estimating for the quarter?", "Jimmy Addison", "Weather normalized growth, Paul, could you?", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Sales growth. Electric sales, what would they have been without this incredibly abnormal weather that you guys had?", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay. Actual margins, as I said earlier, commercial margins were up, just for the quarter. Commercial part margins are preliminary announces as they were up about 3%. Residential was down about 3%, compared over the first quarter of 2011. But that's one quarter. These margins have been very choppy in the last, well frankly, over the last couple of years as we try to come out of this recession, so I would just caution against\u2026", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Why was commercial up 3%?", "Jimmy Addison", "I don't have the specifics as to why. What I can tell you is the last few quarters, industrials have been growing substantially over the year before period and the unemployment rates have been coming down. And as we said in the past, industrials typically lead and that translates into jobs, which helps on the residential front and then the last to come out of it are commercial. Now, whether that's what we're seeing this first quarter or not, I don't know. This is the first quarter we've seen commercial grow year-over-year. So, I wouldn't draw any conclusions over one quarter.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay, fine. And then the credits that you mentioned, what was that? Again I'm sorry, that was some sort of rock issue, what was there?", "Jimmy Addison", "Our side is a hard rock side, but it was covered with clay and prior to getting into the construction to map where the rock is we did a series of core bores. And in the Unit 2 excavation, there was one area between two core bores where it was not linear actually it performed a valley or crevice. And so, as a part of that, we have to fill right in with concrete. It was quite a bit of concrete and probably you're going to take a month or so to fill it in. So that was one of the cost that consortium want to try to recover.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then just finally, Santee Cooper selling looks like it's attempting to sell some of its ownership and there have been \u2013 are there any concerns that you guys have with respect to the potential new partners you might have, credit issues or anything like that that we should be thinking about or I mean does everything look okay over there?", "Jimmy Addison", "Now, the parties that Santee Cooper has announced Letters of Intent with so far all appeared to be credit worthy companies. So, we don't have any concern with those.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Just trying to think through a handful of modeling things, first of all, Jimmy, you mentioned there could be potential for an RSA increase at the back end of the year. That would go into effect, when November any kind of thought or guideline on how big or how small the number that could be?", "Jimmy Addison", "Michael, it would go into effect in November, of course, measured for the 12 months ended March 31st. We obviously just closed those books, we've not made the regulatory adjustments and all that are required as part of that filing. The audit hasn't taken place. But I would say, you have last year kind of as a benchmark. I don't think it would be any larger than last year, but that's just kind of speculation at this point.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If you filed a case, I remember one of your prior cases, I think you filed it mid-year, would that imply implementation, Jim, on 2013?", "Jimmy Addison", "Now, you're switching to electric?", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yes, sorry, yeah.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, right. It's six months by law in South Carolina, so minimum 30 day notice period. Then the filing can be made any time after that 30 days, and then from the time of the filing, six months in total rates.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then can you \u2013 the RSA that went into effect this last year and the BLRA that went into effect in November, how much of that have you benefited from so far? I'm just trying to think through the rest to this year, how much of that revenue increased for both of those items as left to take.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, on the RSA, I'll tell you, it's implemented in November, as we discussed earlier, and about \u2013 for a November implementation about 15% of that increment falls in those tail two months of that calendar year. So, the inverse 85% falls in the next year. The BLRA, frankly I've never analyzed it like that. The gas is driven off. The cyclical nature of the gas business, I don't know if could use the same numbers two months out of 12, probably more pro-rata on the BLRA side, but I really haven't analyzed it like that.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So, safe to assume that the bulk of the RSA, because the bulk of your gas demand is obviously fourth quarter, first quarter driven, has already been taken and there's probably only a limited amount left, but the BLRA is kind of more even or steady ready across the quarters?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Last thing, I'm little confused about one thing. When I look at the debt at the holding company, it implies like $50 million or $55 million a year of holding company interest and if I spread that across the quarters that's like $0.06 or $0.07 drag per quarter if I were to issue that as a standalone and use your tax rate. You are reporting $0.05 this quarter and positive earnings that would imply its instant swing and I'm just curious what the biggest contributors to that are, meaning if interest is a drag of $0.05 or $0.06, $0.06 or $0.07 what's offsetting that more than $0.10?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, that as you know probably that aggregates not just the holding company, but that aggregates the other miscellaneous subsidiaries we held to sale as well like the interstate pipeline business, the communications business etcetera, so all of those are messed in there together.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Have you all ever talk about how much of a contributor you think any of those are likely to be and where they are \u2013 was this quarter abnormal or normal was those?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I wouldn't say it's really abnormal I mean with the low of natural gas. You are getting everybody that can use natural gas from an industrial standpoint they are trying to do it. If they are not already doing it, they are trying to see what they can do to modify their systems to allow them to do it. So anyone that can take gas industrially is so there is some certainly driven by $2 or so of gas but not a huge amount.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then last on O&M because O&M was up year-over-year in the quarter. I want to make sure I'm understanding, you're basically saying that for some portion whether it starts in second quarter or whether it's very back-end loaded you'll actually see O&M down year-over-year to help offset the first quarter delta?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's our plan.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.", "Jimmy Addison", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Andy Levi of Avon Capital. Please go ahead.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hello, Andy.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital", "Just to understand, the earlier question on the BLRA. So you're saying that expectation is to file for about the same amount that you filed for last year?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I was talking about RSA then Andy on the gas business. So on BLRA we had forecasted there in our public docs about I think to slightly over a 3% increase. We're slightly down in the part of the BLRA period that runs through first quarter this year just because of the NRC delay in issuing the license. So, we're 10% or 15% down in this BLRA cycle on our CapEx. We expected to be a little less than that. Our goal is to refresh all of that and file it later this month and go through a full discussion with you at our Analyst Day in about a month.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital", "", "Okay. I had misheard. I apologize. And then again on this rate case that you'll be filing, I guess we have rates go into effect beginning of next year. Is that kind of how it added?", "Jimmy Addison", "The only thing I want to comment on today, really only decisions we've made is to file the notice of intent. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve not made any final decisions on when we would actually make a filing and on any amounts et cetera, because we're just wrapping up the quarter and preparing this information. But we want to go ahead and file that letter of intent and that just starts the process.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital", "So, that will be filed within the next four weeks you said?", "Jimmy Addison", "Later this month, yes.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital", "Later, this month. And then generally, the 30 days after that you file your increase or there is no set kind of timeframe on that?", "Jimmy Addison", "Minimum 30 days after.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital", "Minimum 30 days .And then generally, once you do file your case at the six month process, is that correct?", "Jimmy Addison", "That's by law, the six months. So, the 30 days minimum notice and then it's in our option as to when we make the filing afterwards, but once we make the filing is six months until rates are implementing.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital", "Okay. And again you are not willing to talk about this amount or ballpark or anything like that?", "Jimmy Addison", "Growth not that, not willing. I just don't have the information yet. So, if timing were different we would rather be talking about all of that at the same time, it is just that we are here on the call today and we felt we should give everyone a heads up because we are getting a lot of questions about it.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital", "Possibly by your Analyst Meeting in New York is that time when we will probably get the details?", "Jimmy Addison", "I don't know that yet, we are likely to kind of make \u2013 we are going to make the notice filing by then I don't know that we will have the details on the filing at that point, it maybe the second quarter call.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Addison for any closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Well, thank you all for being with us today to summarize. 2012 has already been an exciting time for our company. We are very pleased to have our combined construction and operating licenses in hand for our new nuclear units and are pleased with our progress we are making on those projects. While the mild weather impacted our results for the quarter in the Georgia market our core fundamentals remain unchanged, and we are continuing to offer a business strategy focused on providing a reliable power to our customers and long-term growth for shareholders and I encourage you all to sign up to attend our Analyst Day on June 5 in New York, if you haven't already.

Thank you for standing by. My name is Denise and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron Hinson - Director, Financial Planning and Investor Relations", "Thank you. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2012.", "Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.", "During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory and regulatory activity, including an update on our base rate case for our electric business. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project, including the recently approved annual rate increase from the Base Load Review Act or BLRA, our current new nuclear hearing as well as the current refueling outage of V.C. Summer Nuclear Station. After those comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that maybe made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on slide two. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we will disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the slides used in conjunction with this call.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Byron. I would like to start by saying to all of you in the path of Sandy that you are in our thoughts and prayers. And continuing with our tradition of providing resources through our mutual assistance arrangements coordinated through the Southeastern Electric Exchange, we have already sent both utility, construction, and three crews to the affected areas. And we are prepared to send additional resources as directed as part of this coordinated effort to assist those in need.", "I will begin our earnings discussion on slide three. Basics earnings per share were $0.93 for the third quarter of 2012 versus $0.81 in 2011. Electric margins were higher due to customer growth and base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act. These margins were partially offset by the cost of our capital program depreciation, interest expense as well as share dilution. Gas margins were also higher due to customer growth and the rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act. Operating and maintenance expenses were slightly lower during the third quarter of 2012 than in the same period of 2011. We still forecast operating and maintenance expenses to be slightly higher for the full year compared to 2011. We also expect a modest trend to continue into 2013 as we continue to see increases in the costs to operate our systems safely and reliably.", "Please turn to slide four. As you can see, basic earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $2.41 versus $2.25 in 2011. Increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to the mild weather in the first quarter along with higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, specifically depreciation, property taxes, interest and share dilution.", "And now on slide five, I\u2019d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company\u2019s 2012 third quarter basic earnings per share denoted in blue were $1.1, an increase of $0.09 over the third quarter of 2011. Electric and gas margins were higher due primarily to increases under the Base Load Review Act and the Rate Stabilization Act coupled with customer growth. This increase in margin was offset by higher interest expense, depreciation as well as share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher about $0.20 due primarily to higher electric and gas margins.", "PSNC Energy shown in red reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, consistent with 2011. Increases in margin due to customer growth were offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2012, basic earnings were $0.21 per share, again consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy in green reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, also consistent with 2011. Year-to-date earnings were down approximately $0.09 due to the impact of mild weather in the first quarter.", "Our corporate and other businesses reported a loss for the quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in 2011. For the nine month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $0.03 compared to a loss of $0.02 in the same period in the prior year. The results for 2011 reflect a slightly higher quarterly effective income tax rate at the holding company, while 2012 results also reflect revenue growth at our interstate pipeline business due to lower natural gas cost.", "Next, I would like to touch on economic trends in our service area as shown on slide six. We continued to be encouraged by the level of economic development in our territories with approximately $1 billion invested in the Carolinas this year. Housing is also encouraging. While we still have not returned to pre-recession levels, we are seeing improvement in each of the areas we serve as you see in the chart at the bottom left. Additionally, SCE&G\u2019s territory, which is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia metro areas has not been as volatile as the rest of the Southeast. In the bottom right you can find our current \u2013 customer growth percentages. We continued to be encouraged by the growth in our customer base. Customer growth has slowed slightly in our electric business during the quarter as it\u2019s typical. We tend to see slower electric customer growth during the third and fourth quarters of the year.", "For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2012, total weather normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were up approximately 1% and 0.4% respectively. Industrial sales were down approximately 2.6% primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire as we have discussed in prior quarters. This customer was brought back on line earlier this month. Where the customer\u2019s operation is consistent with 2011, we estimate overall industrial sales would have increased approximately 1.4%. In addition the Port of Charleston continues to see increased traffic with customer volume up 12% this quarter over the prior year. As I mentioned before it is estimated that one in every five jobs in South Carolina is related to Port volume.", "Please turn now to slide seven, which sets forth our regulated rate base returns in South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on the slide represents information as of the date of our most recent regulatory filings. The pie chart on the upper left presents the components of our regulated rate base of over $7.5 billion as of June 30. This is composed largely of SCE&G electric with approximately $6.4 billion and total electric investment as denoted in two shades of blue.", "As Steve will discuss the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently approved the fifth consecutive rate increase under the Base Load Review Act. The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period, not much has changed here. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina continues to earn a steady return due to customer growth in their territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker. The return on our regulated gas business in South Carolina dropped slightly after the winter season. However, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently issued an order or a rate increase of $7.5 million under the Annual Rate Stabilization Act. This increase should bring the earned ROE for that business more closely in line with the allowed return of 10.25%.", "As you are aware in June of 2012, we filed an application for rate increase for our retail electric business, which I will discuss to a greater extent on the next slide. That application reflected a return of 7.26%. This reflects the full pro forma return considering all known and measurable adjustments as required when the case is filed. The bottom of the slide includes the timeline depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012 outside of the new nuclear project. As you can see in the timeline, we have completed all, but one of our planned regulatory filings. In November, we will undergo the annual review of our gas, fuel cost at SCE&G.", "Please turn now to slide eight. On June 29, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission requesting an increase in our retail electric rates. In this application, we requested an allowed ROE of 10.95% and additional revenue of $151.5 million. We filed our testimony on October 2 in the Office of Regulatory Staff and other interveners filed their testimony last Friday. We are constructively engaged with ORS and the other interveners in hopes of reaching a settlement by hearing a schedule for November 27 and we anticipate receiving an order from the commission in late December as new rates are effective January 2013.", "Slide nine presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report from August, which includes amounts as of the second quarter of 2012. We will update these amounts with our next quarterly filing in mid-November to include changes in AFC, escalation and construction activities. Otherwise, this slide is identical to the CapEx forecast we shared during our second quarter earnings call. Also, as you can see along the bottom of the slide and due to your request, we have included our anticipated incremental nuclear CWIP as of June 30 of each year. This represents the incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increases are calculated. As you will note, the amounts are nearly the same as the calendar period CWIP that we have previously provided.", "Please turn to slide 10 to review our financing plan, which is consistent with our last earnings call. We have successfully completed all of our planned debt financings for 2012 and our estimated financing plan through 2017 remains unchanged. We continued to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity forward during the first quarter of 2013, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.6 million shares.", "As presented on slide 11, we are tightening our guidance for the year to $3.10 to $3.25 in basic earnings per share. We estimate our effective tax rate for 2012 will be approximately 30%. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share. While we have seen positive economic signs in our territory, we remain conservative about customer growth and usage. While weather normalized sales are up over the last 12 months, the monthly change versus the prior year has been inconsistent.", "Finally, on slide 12, we are very pleased to report earlier this month we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction and the tenure spans substantially all of the planned peak construction period of the new units. The committed lines of credit now total $1.8 billion, with $1.6 billion covering the entire five years and an additional $200 million over the three years for added peak construction liquidity. I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and support of our nuclear expansion plants. We are pleased that we have received an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors as well as our banks.", "I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Steve Byrne - Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks Jimmy. I would now like to direct your attention to slide 13. We are pleased the construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018 for Unit 3. We have made progress in several years during the past quarter. We completed the installation of the Unit 2 rebar cage assembly, poured 30,000 cubic yards of nuclear concrete and begun fabricating the walls of the turbine building. We also continue to make progress on the switchyard and cooling towers and have begun training operators for the two new nuclear facilities. The heavy lift derrick has been assembled, tested and is currently in use. Large component manufacture continues to progress at sites around the world.", "And slide 14 shows two of those components at our facility in South Korea. The reactor vessel has completed testing and is expected to be received on-site early in 2013. The steam generators for Unit 2 are scheduled to be tested around year-end and expected to be delivered early next year.", "Please turn now to slide 15 which shows the progress of the nuclear island for Unit 2 throughout the year. Over the past months, we have completed the installation of leveling concrete and the waterproof membrane which is same as between a lower mud-mat and higher strength upper mud-mat. We also completed the installation of our rebar cage on top of the mud-mats. Our next step will be to pour base mat which will be the foundation of the nuclear island. On this six-foot thick nuclear island base mat, we will the CR-10 module as pictured on slide 16. CR-10 module is nearing completion and has been fabricated on-site. As you might recall, the CR-10 has a steel frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed. We anticipate setting the lower containment bowl later this year or early next year. So, in summary, the construction is progressing well and on track to achieve the amended completion date.", "On slide 17, we review our new nuclear and Base Load Review Act filings as related \u2013 and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response of that request in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.1 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30th. This is the fifth rate increase under the BLRA. We continued to be pleased that the mechanism is working as designed.", "Our BLRA filings for 2012 are shown in the bottom of the slide. And as you can see on August 14th, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the Commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2012. This report provided a detailed update of capital cost incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2012 in November.", "As you may remember, in May, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission seeking to update our budget and schedule. A new schedule set the substantial completion dates for the units at March of 2017 and May of 2018. The updated costs totaled $283 million and were primarily the result of delays in receipt of our license, and agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse related to challenged costs for the construction of our two new nuclear units, transmission costs and additional owners costs or a non-EPC cost for which we are responsible, such as staffing, information technology and facilities. The hearing for this filing was held on October the 2nd and 3rd. During the hearing, we provided the Commission with an update on the project and presented evidence that our decision to pursue nuclear generation remains prudent. We anticipate receiving an order from the Commission on these items in mid-November.", "On slide 18, you\u2019ll see a picture of Unit 1 at V.C. Summer Nuclear Station. On October the 12th, we took Unit 1 offline to begin a scheduled refueling outage. The outage follows an 18-month operating cycle and is the 20th for V.C. Summer since the station began commercial operation in 1984. The outage allows us to replace one-third of V.C. Summer\u2019s 157 uranium fuel assemblies and to perform preventive maintenance work that cannot be performed when the reactor is operating. During this outage, we performed a planned inspection of the reactor vessel head.", "This inspection is designed to find minor defects which allowed timely repairs and prevents an actual problem. The reactor vessel head contains a total of 66 penetrations which are mostly used to maneuver control rods in the reactor. As a result of this inspection we identified welds for four of those penetrations that need repair. An extensive robotic inspection of the reactor vessel showed there was no leakage from these areas as a result of the condition of the welds. We notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as required and developed a strategy to repair the welds. These repairs have been made successfully at other nuclear facilities. As part of the planning for this inspection V.C. Summer and Westinghouse personnel developed a detailed contingency plan if repairs were needed. We will now execute this plan. Our focus is on completing the repair safely during the outage before returning the reactor to service.", "We are pleased to announce that the beginning of this scheduled outage marks the end of the first breaker-to-breaker cycle in the history of V.C. Summer. A breaker-to-breaker run is an industry term recognizing a plant that operates continuously between refueling outages and only occurs when the plant reliability is very high. V.C. Summer was connected to the grid for 501 continuous days, which also set energy production records for the station.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And the first question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar Securities. Please go ahead.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar Securities", "", "Good morning. Thanks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good morning.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar Securities", "Wanted some more detail on conversation, you\u2019ve had perhaps with regulators or other outside parties on the rate case, and particularly the ROE elements, what are the sticking points? What are the pros and cons that you\u2019ve heard and obviously with interest rates where they are in some other allowed ROEs we have seen over the couple months that 10.95% appears quite high relative to peers and other financial metrics? Can you just discuss kind of again the pros and construction, what the other people involved in the case are thinking along those lines?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, sure to the extent I can of course. What we have filed, we believe is very defensible. When you look at the some of the peers, it\u2019s difficult to get apples-to-apples. Some of our peers have prospective forward-looking test years. We have a historical test year. So, as I have said before by the time we start off with new rates, it\u2019s very difficult to get within 50 basis points of the ROE just because of the historical nature of the test year and the attrition that occurs. Some of the other peers have more mechanisms, if you will, around environmental matters and things like that than we do. So, you really got to be careful when you just compare numbers from across the country, because I think ours are more pure. And I think those are the kinds of factors that the commissions here in the Southeast have taken into consideration when they have granted ROEs in the past. And of course, very few of our peers in fact one is building new nuclear at the same time we do which brings increased risk as well. So, those would be the primary factors that I would suggest differentiate us.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar Securities", "Well, what are the elements in the rate case aside from the ROE that you are looking at in the settlement, where I suppose again, we are part of the most contentious issues are the ones that the other parties in the potential settlement want some clarity on?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, I am going to protect the confidentiality of those discussions as I have to or else it would deteriorate into never reaching a settlement most likely, but all parties are attempting to do that so we are working hard about it. Let me just frame it by saying that the commission has a practice that they like to have any settlements presented to them at least a week before the beginning of the hearing. So, they have got ample time to consider this settlement when they are hearing the testimony from the various parties. So, that essentially means we have got the next two weeks, this week, next week to try to work something out and we are trying. And I am encouraged by the party\u2019s participation and I think everyone is serious about it.", "I don\u2019t know that there are any other significant items that would have as large of an impact, particularly on earnings as would ROE. So, that\u2019s certainly a significant item, but there are other items too. For example, we have got some deferred costs related to the scrubber that we installed at the Wateree Station, that was not completely in service at the time of our last increase about 2.5 years ago. So, we agreed to defer that until this time. So, one of the items that will be up for discussion is what amortization period do you collect that deferral over. So, there is differences in opinions over that and that will go into the judgment. That\u2019s just an example.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar Securities", "", "Great. Thanks a lot for the detail.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Hi, good morning.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good morning.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Going back to the rate case, I\u2019m think you had said that staff and interveners have filed their testimony already, that\u2019s correct right?", "Jimmy Addison", "It is, that\u2019s true.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "So, what did they recommend in terms of an ROE?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, there is variety of recommendations. The ORS recommended 10.25% and some of the other parties that made other lower recommendations and of course ours was at 10.95%. So, you\u2019ve got ranging from anywhere in the 9.5 or so percent range to our 10.95%.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "The lowest was 9.5%?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, I don\u2019t know precisely what the lowest, but was in that range.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, and then you talked about deferral period, so are other any other big issues that particularly the staff brought up other than that and ROE?", "Jimmy Addison", "I don\u2019t recall any other significant issues those are the most significant.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, and then you mentioned that you found some \u2013 during the inspection of Summer 1 that there is going be some repairs on the welds, so I was wondering do you have a sense yet for how long the outage is going to be then at that unit?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah, Dan, it\u2019s Steve. We anticipate that we\u2019re going to add about somewhere between two and three weeks to outage scope.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, and what was the original plan?", "Steve Byrne", "Original was around 40 days, so we ought to have the unit back on somewhere in the first or second week of December.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, and then I was wondering if you could give us just a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing in your service territory from industrial sector, I know you mentioned that you have that customer with the fire comeback on line, but beyond that and given that you\u2019ve had a number of new like the Boeing plant stuff like that what we see\u2026?", "Jimmy Addison", "We\u2019ve had \u2013 2011 was an extremely strong year. The announcements have been slower this year, but what\u2019s occurring now is some of the announcements what were made in the past of course were starting to materialize now. One of the more significant ones of those is a pharmaceutical manufacturer that\u2019s locating a facility in fact just cross the interstate here from our corporate headquarters and they are looking to add about 700 jobs or so very, very good jobs in the $70,000 to $80,000 range. So, we\u2019re seeing the lot of these kind of coming into fruition now so while the announcements aren\u2019t as much, that\u2019s encouraging. And overall and as I said earlier industrial sales if this one industrial customer were at full level would be up about 1.5% on a weather normal basis.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, and then my last questions relates to your financing plan and I was wondering where you stand related to potential loans from the DOE?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, we\u2019re \u2013 the position really hasn\u2019t changed there Dan. We continued to communicate with the DOE, but as we\u2019ve constructed this project from the beginning to be financed with public debt and equity and that has been supported very well to-date, and as I said earlier supported by the banks tremendously in renewing and raising our credit facility. So, this point we don\u2019t envisioning \u2013 envision participating in that although if things could change down the road.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium. Please go ahead.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Hi, how are doing?", "Jimmy Addison", "Good.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "I just wanted to go over, I guess the guidance where it comes out I guess you have it. As you \u2013 Jimmy as we look at next year because you don\u2019t file rate cases on electric side so often. And we will get double whammy, right. We will have the BLRA increase which has happened. And I guess \u201813, \u201814, \u201815 are big high CapEx and rate base years. But then you will also have your rate increase which is coming in I believe effective January 1. So, as we look at it shouldn\u2019t earnings be growing at higher than the \u2013 your range that you have forecasted, because the rate case is going to expound the results with the release? Is that a fair assumption as we look at 2013 that the earnings should be higher than the top end of the range that you have mentioned as part of the long-term?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, two things. First of all, we are still comfortable with the range, if there becomes a point that we think that range is inaccurate, we\u2019ll certainly update the range for you, but secondly, there is no certainty yet around the rate case. So, normally, we like to provide the following year guidance on this call and we are just not in position to do that this year, because of such a significant variance variable factor that is with the rate case. So, we are going to need to wait until our year end call to do that, but we are still comfortable with the range at this point.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Yeah, Jimmy, you didn\u2019t understand my question. My question is on the range is long-term range it\u2019s not a one-year range, if I am right, the way I look at your range unless you can correct me?", "Jimmy Addison", "You are correct.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "You are correct.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay. So, that\u2019s the number one assumption, okay. Second, I am saying is because you don\u2019t file rate cases every year that the year that you have a rate case decision coming pending, and it\u2019s a pretty hefty rate case. Shouldn\u2019t you be above that range because of a double whammy effect of the BLRA and the rate case? So, you should technically be higher than the range, and of course, the range will go down some years and everything, but technically you should be higher on that range next year?", "Jimmy Addison", "I think I do understand your question, but I don\u2019t believe that to be the case. Of course, the rate case, there is a lots of expenses that come along with that case too if you were listening earlier and I was talking about the amortization period. There will be revenue associated with that amortization, but there will be a dollar in expense for every dollar in revenue associated with it too. So, that will create no margins, no earnings at all, that\u2019s simply a dollar for dollar wash in collecting the cash that we have already spent. So, and I know you are aware that. That\u2019s just one example. But I really don\u2019t think that will be the case next year.", "Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium", "Okay, thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The next question will be from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Hi, how are you doing?", "Steve Byrne", "Good Paul.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "I\u2019m just \u2013 most of my stuff was asked, but the litigation or excuse me disagreements with contractors or anything, do you guys I am sorry if I understood, it\u2019s been a crazy morning. Is there any issue there that you\u2019d like to talk about or you could describe like you see it obviously with another company that\u2019s building a nuclear plant?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah, Paul, this is Steve. I think I can\u2019t speak to that other company.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Sure.", "Steve Byrne", "Building the nuclear plant and what their disagreements may or may not be, but we have had some disagreements with our contractors that we have negotiated and settled. That settlement was made earlier this year and the expenses associated with that settlement were included in the Base Load Review Act update filing that we made and presented to our Public Service Commission in early October. So, we\u2019ve settled those disputes from our perspective without having to go the litigation round.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Okay. Nothing new was developed since then, right?", "Steve Byrne", "We have nothing new that we are aware of.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And could you give us a feeling as to \u2013 and I apologize if just I can\u2019t recall right now, what the total amount was that you guys settled on?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, we \u2013 the amount to SCE&G in that settlement with Shaw and Westinghouse was $138 million.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And that\u2026", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s our 55% piece.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "That\u2019s what you got. Okay, that\u2019s your 55% piece. And what was the total amount that was in disagreement? Sorry to touch on this spot if you don\u2019t want to come back to me, that\u2019s okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, I am trying to remember what the total was. It was something I believe, just short of $400 million. It was in that range anyway.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "And that was the total amount or just the amount that was SCE&G\u2019s disputed amount?", "Jimmy Addison", "I think that $400 millionish was the total amount.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then with respect to the economy and stuff, it looks like you guys are on a 12-month running basis it\u2019s coming up, it\u2019s improving, anymore sort of outlook or flavor you could give for us on that?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, it is up across all categories on a 12-month basis residential up about 1%, commercial up about 0.5%. And then industrial, if you pro forma in a full year run-rate for that one customer, I mentioned it would be up almost 1.5% also. So, things continued to go well there. I hear from the commerce folks here in South Carolina that there are lot of things pending, they are just not ready for announcement yet. I also have mentioned earlier, I think port traffic at the Port of Charleston was up significantly in Q3, up over 10% year-over-year and that is a significant factor in South Carolina as it is such a heavy driver in the economy.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And is there any change in usage patterns or anything else that you are detecting there, I mean, obviously the economy is doing better than everything but is it coming in pretty much as you expected or any thought on that?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. I\u2019d say if anything Paul, it\u2019s slightly on the upside. We have been fairly conservative just because of the erratic nature of it. I would say its still \u2013 still not a linear trend, so we have still got to kind of keep our fingers crossed on the thing, but as a whole, I would say things are looking a little better than we had expected earlier in the year.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Jimmy Addison", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "The next question will come from David Paz of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hello, good morning.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hello, David.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just actually following up on the last question, when you said that residential power, sales were up about 1%, are you referring to a weather adjusted number?", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s correct.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, commercial diesel was 1.5% as well and there is not a lot of weather there?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. Commercial is about a 0.5% where industrial would be about 1.5% if you included a full year comparable period for that one industrial customer that was down due to the fire.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Alright, great, thanks. And then picking up on actually Ashar\u2019s question, can I just get a sense, I think you've said this in the past, but remind me how much incremental pre-tax margin would come from your requested rate increase, net of all the costs?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, based on what was filed about $50 million.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s pre-tax.", "Jimmy Addison", "After-tax.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "After tax, okay, I want to confirm that. Thanks. And then in looking at the ORS\u2019 recommendation, do you happen to know what are the difference between their recommendation and your request, how much of that is associated with the differing ROEs on a dollar basis?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, that\u2019s 74 basis points, that\u2019s about 30, little over $30 million $30, $32 million.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it, great. And actually going back to Q4, \u201811, can you remind me was there any weather benefit or hit that you guys experienced in that quarter?", "Jimmy Addison", "David, let me back up your last question first to be sure I am clear, because we are talking after-tax and then pre-tax numbers. The last information I gave you about the $30 million or so, that\u2019s pre-tax.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Pre-tax right?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah. So, the earlier one was after-tax the 50 and that ROE estimate was pre-tax.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Perfect. Yeah, and\u2026", "Jimmy Addison", "So, you asked about weather?", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "The weather impact in Q4 \u201911?", "Jimmy Addison", "Q4 \u201811 would be Georgia, really\u2026", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Actually normal.", "Jimmy Addison", "Slightly milder normal, I believe, but I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips, David.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Alright, no problem. I can follow-up later. And then just the last on O&M, in your script you have talked \u2013 you touched on O&M, I think you\u2019ve said that you expected O&M to slightly or modestly increase full year \u201812 versus full year \u201811. I guess, can you confirm that and is that the actual O&M that you see this year, or is that based on the pro forma you included in the rate cases just want to get a sense of?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right. You see the actual that we are seeing this year, so I think year-to-date it\u2019s in the 1.5% to 2% range up. So, something around that would be what we would expect for the full year, and of course, those that come in as part of the rate case those new expenses would not go into effect until January of \u201813 when the revenue accompanied them.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right. And I think you said about that you would see some of that trend go into \u201813 is that should we see roughly same percentage basis or would it\u2026.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yeah, I think something in the 1% to 2% range would be the best ballpark. Of course that can change a lot, just based on this earlier discussion we had about these amortization periods.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Okay, great. Thanks so much.", "Jimmy Addison", "But there will be no margin impact from that once you\u2019ve shorter period, more revenue, longer period and less revenue.", "David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right, right, alright. Thanks again.", "Jimmy Addison", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Addison for any closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, thank you. And just to summarize, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter. And while customer growth and rate mechanisms continue to drive the margins, we maintain our focus on containing operation and maintenance cost and construction of our new nuclear project continues to move forward.

Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron W. Hinson", "Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012. Joining us on the call today are Kevin Marsh, Chairman and CEO of SCANA; Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.", "During the call, Kevin will make opening comments and Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory, regulatory activity and earnings guidance for 2013.

Marsh", "Thanks, Byron, and I'll begin on Slide 3. SCANA had a very good year in 2012, both financially and operationally, and Jimmy and Steve will speak to those accomplishments in just a few minutes. Like most businesses, we had plenty of opportunities and challenges during the year to keep our team busy. Early in the year, we developed and then executed a multifaceted strategy to overcome the challenges of the extremely mild weather that impacted our natural gas marketing business in Georgia. Additionally, the new nuclear team received our combined operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and made substantive progress on the construction of the 2 new plants.", "Last year, we completed a comprehensive analysis of each business unit through our robust, strategic planning process that allows our management team to focus on significant issues and to execute. One example of a positive outcome of the strategic planning process is our decision to consolidate the leadership of all our regulated natural gas operations under one leader. Rusty Harris, who previously served as President of PSNC Energy in North Carolina, is now leading this combined group as President of SCANA's natural gas operations. You may remember Rusty from our Analyst Day presentations last year.", "As a company, our strong financial and operational results are reflected in our total return to shareholders, which outperformed the majority of our peers in 2012. Yesterday, we announced an increase in our annual dividend rate, further contributing to shareholder return.", "Several years ago, I was on the earnings call when we announced we were lowering our growth rate. We monitored the economic impact of the recession over the last 24 months, and we're more confident in the economic environment today than we were in 2011. Unemployment in our service area has improved by nearly 200 basis points, and customer growth also continues to improve. As a result, today I am pleased to tell you that we are increasing our growth rate. As Jimmy will discuss shortly, we are raising the upper band of our long-term growth rate from 5% to 6%. Our new growth target will therefore be 3% to 6% over a 3- to 5-year period, reflecting our more optimistic view while acknowledging some volatility in margin growth. We are now focused on executing our 2013 plan to achieve this goal.", "Jimmy and Steve will now lead you through a discussion of our 2012 results and areas of focus for 2013. Obviously, one of our primary areas of focus will continue to be our new nuclear project. We are entering a period of peak construction spending, and focusing on successful execution will continue to be paramount. I'm confident we have a qualified team in place that will be able to bring this project to completion. Another area of focus for the next few years will be managing our base electric business, with a goal of no request for base rate increases until peak nuclear construction is behind us.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy, who will discuss our 2012 results.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 4. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2012 were $0.79 per share compared to $0.76 per share in the same quarter of 2011. Higher electric and gas margins, as well as proceeds from the sale of communications towers, partially offset by increases in operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation and dilution. The increase in operating and maintenance expense was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and generation expenses. As I've mentioned previously, incentive compensation levels were abnormally low in 2011 due to stock performance and the fact that we did not meet our internal earnings target for the year. In 2012, we outperformed most of our peer group and exceeded our internal earnings target, resulting in the accrual of additional at-risk incentive comp.", "Generation-related expenses were somewhat higher due largely to changes in the O&M and fuel allocation mix at our biomass facility. We also had termination fees related to the change in the third-party administrator for our health plan in the fourth quarter of 2012. As you can see on Slide 5, for the full year, our GAAP basic earnings were $3.20 per share. There are several factors which should be considered as you review our 2012 earnings and look forward to 2013.", "First, I would like to review the weather impact. 2012 marked the warmest year on record in the U.S. We experienced $0.11 per share of abnormal weather in 2012 comprised of $0.10 in Georgia in the first and fourth quarters, as well as $0.01 in the first quarter at SCE&G. As Kevin said, we recognized early on that weather in Georgia was going to be a challenge, but we remained committed to meeting our earnings target. It took several actions, including the sales of several well-subscribed telecommunications towers, as we do in the normal course of business from time to time. These sales of those towers contributed a gain of approximately $0.04 per share. We also reduced our forecasted spending, which contributed an additional $0.05 to the bottom line. The year-over-year increase in O&M is due to factors we discussed earlier: incentive comp, generation expenses and termination fees associated with health care. As a result of these actions and stronger-than-expected margin growth, we were able to more than offset the impact of weather.", "Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's full year 2012 earnings were up $0.23 compared to 2011, driven largely by base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and the Gas Rate Stabilization Act, along with customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expenses, interest and depreciation expenses, and share dilution. For the fourth quarter, SCE&G's earnings were $0.04 higher than the same period last year, reflecting the aforementioned margin increases. PSNC Energy's earnings for 2012 were $0.38 per share compared to $0.37 per share in 2011. Increased margins from customer growth were somewhat offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, and depreciation. Fourth quarter 2012 earnings were flat over the same period in 2011. SCANA Energy reported lower earnings for the year and quarter primarily driven by the abnormally mild weather as I discussed earlier. SCANA's Corporate and other businesses for 2012 reported a gain of $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in 2011. The increase is largely due to the sale of telecommunications towers as mentioned previously.", "Next, I would like to touch on sales growth as shown on Slide 7. Weather-normalized sales volumes have shown promise, particularly in the latter half of 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, total weather-normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were up approximately 2.4% and 1.7%, respectively. Industrial sales were down approximately 1.7%, primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire, as we discussed in prior quarters. This customer was brought back online on October. Were this customer's operations consistent with 2011, we estimate industrial sales would have increased approximately 1.4%, while total weather-normalized retail sales would have increased approximately 2%. Of the total retail sales growth, approximately 2/3 was from increased usage, while 1/3 was attributable to new customers.", "On Slide 8, you will find information about economic trends in our service territories. We continue to be encouraged by the level of economic development activity with approximately $1.6 billion announced investment in our Carolina territories this year.", "Census data also shows a positive trend in domestic population migration for our service territories. Of the 4 census graphic -- geographic regions, the South region saw significantly greater domestic population migration growth. In fact, more than 10x the growth of any other region. South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia are all among the top 10 states in population growth, signifying that more people are relocating to the Southeast and more importantly, into our service territories, which leads to customer growth. Over the last year, customer growth has trended higher in our electric business, as well as in our regulated gas businesses in South and in North Carolina. As of December 2012, those rates were 0.9% for electric, 1.8% for SCE&G gas, and 2% for PSNC. SCE&G gas had its best growth rate since 2007 and PSNC had 2 linked quarters of 2% customer growth.", "Please turn to Slide 9, which sets forth our regulated rate base and returns. The bar graph on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of over $7.6 billion. As you can see from the items denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is composed of SCE&G electric. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continue to perform well. Public Service of North Carolina continues to earn a strong return due to customer growth in its territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker mechanism. The return on the regulated gas business in South Carolina reflects the November rate increase of $7.5 million under the Rate Stabilization Act. We also continued to see the expected returns on the new nuclear project under the BLRA.", "As we've mentioned previously, a strategic goal for 2013 and beyond will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years of 2013 through 2015. Control of O&M and non-new nuclear CapEx, while monitoring and responding to margin fluctuations, will be essential to achieving this goal. As you're all aware, in late December, the PSC issued an order approving an overall increase in retail electric revenues of approximately $97 million with an allowed ROE of 10.25%. We anticipate this rate increase will have a net income impact of approximately $26 million in 2013. These new rates were effective on January 1, 2013.", "We will file our quarterly surveillance report for SCE&G electric with the Commission in mid-March. We estimate the regulatory retail electric ROE for the 12 months ended December 2012 is approximately 10%. We continue to fine-tune our strategy with a goal of managing this business so that we earn a reasonable return while not requesting a base rate increase during this period of peak nuclear construction.  The bottom of the slide includes a timeline depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2013 outside of the new nuclear project. These planned activities are standard annual filings. As you can see in the timeline, we have completed our annual demand side management filing and we'll be submitting our integrated resource plan shortly.", "Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report filed on February 13 and reflects our new CapEx budget for 2013 through 2015. On the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental nuclear CWIP as of June 30. This represents the incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated. Our projected nuclear spend has not changed substantially since the last public version of this slide. The projection for capital spending at our North Carolina LDC and in our gas transmission business has increased to accommodate growth in both of these subsidiaries. Spending at SCE&G has remained largely consistent with the previous CapEx schedule we presented, with increases in our generation, transmission and distribution categories being partially offset with decreases in other categories.", "Please turn to Slide 11 to review our financing plan. As a result of a shift in our nuclear spending, as shown in the Q3 and Q4 BLRA filings, coupled with the extension of bonus depreciation into 2013, we have pushed approximately $275 million of additional equity from 2013 to 2014. We are committed to drawing the remaining funds from our equity forward contract during the first quarter of this year, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.6 million shares. We expect this equity from the forward, in addition to the $100 million from the employee stock and other DRIP plans to meet our needs for 2013, further minimizing dilution. The blue box denotes our estimate of the additional equity needed to complete nuclear construction. Of course, the amounts and timing could change due to a change in inflation, bonus depreciation, the construction schedule or other factors.", "I would also like to touch briefly on our pension plan. I'm pleased to report that our pension plan remains adequately funded. We have not had to make a cash contribution to the plan since 1997, and do not anticipate any such contributions until after 2014. In addition, we are now largely insulated from the earnings impact of changes in pension costs as a result of the implementation of a pension cost recovery rider as part of our latest electric rate case.", "Slide 12 presents our 2013 earnings guidance and related assumptions. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we have increased the upper band of our long-term target growth rate from 5% to 6%. Therefore, our new target will be 3% to 6% over a 3- to 5-year period, based on 2012 GAAP basic earnings per share of $3.20. This increase represents our projected earnings momentum driven by our BLRA filings, our stated goal to manage retail electric returns and our view of the economy, balanced with our assumption of the impacts of the phase-in of the CFL lightbulbs and other efficiency standards.", "Our 2013 guidance is $3.25 to $3.45 per share, and our internal target is $3.35. Typically, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in each of the first and third quarters, approximately 25% in the fourth quarter, and the remainder in the second. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA, the 2012 gas RSA filing and the retail electric base rate increase that took effect on January 1. This guidance also assumes drawing the funds under our equity forward contracts in the first quarter of 2013, and incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier.", "Additionally, while we anticipate the number of customers will continue to increase, our assumption of customer average use of electricity is lower next year considering the aforementioned energy efficiency impacts. We anticipate overall retail sales growth for 2013 to be slightly less than 0.5%. We forecast customer growth to be in a similar range to 2012.", "We expect operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 2.5% higher in 2013, excluding bad debt expense and specific O&M expense increases associated with the recent rate case, since those have already been considered in the anticipated $26 million net income impact we previously provided. If you were to include rate case and bad debt expenses, O&M would grow at approximately double the 2.5% rate. The largest driver of rate case expenses is the recognition of pension expense in 2013. While this increase will be offset with additional revenue via a rider, it will cost the O&M line item to increase on the face of the financials. In regards to non-rate case O&M, approximately 1/3 of the expected increase is due to deferred items from 2012.", "Some of the other items driving the increase include amortization of program costs from our demand side management program, which are offset with increased electric margin and increased reliability related costs. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx related cost of property taxes, depreciation and interest. Also, our effective tax rate for 2012 was approximately 30% and we estimate the rate for 2013 will be approximately 32%. Our lower effective tax rate for the last couple of years has reflected the amortization of previously deferred state investment tax credits, and that amortization ran its course during 2012. The higher effective rate was considered in our most recent electric rate case. In addition, we've seen a fundamental shift in the Georgia market. The business has really matured during the last decade, resulting in thinner margins and enhanced competition for customers. As a result, we estimate earnings in Georgia will be slightly lower prospectively, and in the range of approximately $0.18 to $0.20 per share.", "Keeping in mind our internal target of $3.35, let's discuss the potential upsides and downsides to our 2013 earnings range. There are several factors that could cause us to trend towards the lower end of our guidance. We continue to see fluctuations in average use. While we were pleased with usage in 2012, we believe that there's uncertainty around average use. And as a result, we have forecasted average use to be slightly lower in 2013. Average use could come in even lower than forecast due to higher CFL bulb adoption rates. Customer growth continues to be a bright spot in our service territory. We are currently forecasting an increase similar to 2012. However, there is the possibility that customer growth comes in lower than expected. And as you are all aware, many American households have seen a reduction in take-home pay in 2013 due to the recent expiration of the payroll tax holiday. Lower discretionary income could impact customer spending. In addition, gasoline prices are already increasing, which could further impact discretionary spending, particularly in our service territories, where customers typically drive personal vehicles to and from work. Additionally, if nuclear spending were to slow down or shift to later years, it would negatively impact our earnings potential for 2013.", "In contrast, there are several factors that could push it toward the upper end of our guidance. If average use were to increase at 2012 levels or better or if customer growth accelerates beyond 2012 levels, we could have potential upside. Hopefully, this will provide you with a line of sight into our view of 2013 as you update your own models.  And finally, I want to mention our upcoming Analyst Day event to be held in New York on June 5. Please mark your calendars and plan to attend.", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy. I'd now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. Construction continues to progress at our nuclear site in Jenkinsville, South Carolina. The project maintains an excellent safety record and has seen good coordination between the various contractor companies on-site. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates in 2017 for Unit 2 and 2018 for Unit 3.", "On the top left of the slide, you can see a picture of the switchyard. Switchyard was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2012 and was energized for testing this year. At top right, you will see a picture of Cooling Tower 2 Alpha. Progress on all 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continues to progress as anticipated. On the bottom left, you'll see the Unit 2 Turbine Building. Turbine Building basemat for Unit 2 is substantially complete and we are starting vertical construction. At bottom right, you'll see a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island, rock cleaning and form work have been completed and leveling concrete has been poured. The lower and upper mud mats, along with the waterproof membrane will be installed in the coming months.", "Slide 14 is a picture of the Unit 2 Nuclear Island. As you may have noticed, in January, we filed a License Amendment Request or LAR and a Preliminary Amendment Request or PAR, with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to reflect changes in the license design as it relates to reinforcing bar in the Nuclear Island basemat. The proposed changes reflect a modification to the American Concrete Institute code section referenced in the design from Section 349 to Section 318. The use of this code section requires relatively minor changes to the rebar and to the thickness of the concrete in the areas below the elevator pits and the sump.", "In January, we received a No Objection letter from the NRC staff on the path laid out in the PAR. At that point, we began work on the reinforcing bar reconfiguration, allowing us to prepare for the nuclear concrete pour upon receipt of the LAR. We're optimistic that we will receive the LAR in the first quarter. We don\u2019t expect this issue to impact the commercial operation dates for the 2 units.", "As you may have noticed in our most recent BLRA filing, we have filed 7 LARs to date and anticipate that there will be more throughout the course of the project. I wanted to bring to your attention that these filings are relatively routine and are a normal part of the nuclear licensing process. Not only are they filed for new nuclear construction, but they are routine in all nuclear facilities, including our V.C. Summer Unit #1. These filings were made periodically throughout the construction of our new nuclear build.", "Overall, the fabrication of equipment off-site is proceeding on a schedule that supports the commercial operation date of the units. The components of the condenser for Unit 2 have arrived on-site and are being assembled. Manufacturing and testing of the reactor vessel for Unit 2, as seen on Slide 15, is nearing completion and shipment is planned for the second quarter of 2013. Steam generators for Unit 2 are also scheduled to be delivered in 2013. However, the schedule for fabrication of the sub-modules from a Shaw Modular Solutions facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana, remains a focus area for the project. Senior management from SCE&G, Shaw and Westinghouse continue to actively provide oversight, and we continue to see improvement in the fabrication and delivery process related to the sub-modules.", "Progress at the Sanmen plant in China, which is building the AP1000 design, is going well, as you can see on Slide 16. In January, they successfully set the containment vessel top head, which you can still see attached to the large blue crane. All major equipment has been installed and the welding of the main cooling piping is in process. We congratulate them on their achievements and look forward to accomplishing the same milestones.", "Slide 17 gives you a visual representation of the sections of the containment vessel. You can see that the top head, which Sanmen just set -- the containment vessel is approximately 215 feet tall, 130 feet in diameter and weighs about 7 million pounds. The containment vessel is assembled in 5 main sections: the bottom head, 3 ring sections and the top head. Each section is assembled and welded from individual steel plates that are shipped to the site from sub-vendors, where they have been rolled, formed, cut and beveled.", "On Slide 18, you can see the progress that has been made on the fabrication of the containment vessel for Unit 2. The on-site fabrication by Chicago Bridge & Iron is steadily progressing. They have worked on the rings that attach the completed bottom head and which will form the vertical walls of the containment vessel containers.", "On Slide 19, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings and related rate increases. In September of last year, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved a rate increase of $52 million. These new rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30. We continue to be pleased that the mechanism is working as designed. Our BLRA filings for 2013 are shown at the bottom of the slide. As you can see, our next quarterly status report will be filed in May, and we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in May as well.", "Information on Slide 20 reflects the expected rate increases for our nuclear project through 2015. As you can see, the amount for 2013 is lower than the number previously provided in May of last year, due largely to the shift of CapEx as discussed in our third quarter 2012 BLRA report and the escalation associated with that shift. The amounts for 2014 and 2015 are largely unchanged. We will adjust these numbers in May when we make our request for revised rates, but we wanted to give you a sense of our current expectations.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Adam Muro of Goldman Sachs.", "Adam Muro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Adam Muro here, subbing in for Michael and Neil. Just curious, the Vogtle plant under construction by Georgia Power recently faced a challenge of the railcar used to get the reactor vessel from the port to the plant site was not big enough, creating some logistical issues. I mean, just curious on whether this impacts your construction project. If so, how, and what can be done to remedy this?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "This is Steve. The railcar that was used to transport the reactor vessel from the Port of Savannah to the Vogtle site,  I didn't understand that it was undersized but the load did shift in transit not far out of the Port of Savannah. The vendor, in this case it's Westinghouse, along with the railcar vendor, are redesigning that car. We don\u2019t anticipate that it's going to have any impact on our delivery schedule. We don't need our reactor vessel on the site until sometime next year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just discuss your dividend policy and ability to increase the dividend in line with your targeted earnings growth rate, particularly given the amount of capital expenditure you have coming up?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Sure. Well our policy is 55% to 60% payout ratio. And we got a little ahead of that, not due to dividend growth, but due to a pullback in earnings at the beginning of the recession a few years ago. And we presented a plan to our board about 3 years ago. They took the third step in that plan yesterday, which we published. And that is to continue to grow dividends, but grow them at a lesser rate than the earnings growth so that we get back inside the top end of that payout ratio. So we're very close to it now, I think based on our proposed guidance for '13, we're just slightly over 60%. So we would expect to be able to continue to grow it until we're completely inside of that range at a slightly lower rate than earnings growth, and then we would expect the dividend growth to be fairly consistent with earnings growth.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Great. If you could provide a little color on the expected difference between the retail sales guidance of roughly 0.5% compared to 2% for 2012 if you include the customer outage. Is that all just due to higher efficiency rates?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "It principally is. And we've expected our actual number of customers added, new customers added to the system would be very similar in 2013 to 2012, that's our planning assumption. At least we based it off of what we had experienced through Q3. When we put our plan together, of course, Q4 accelerated just slightly above that from 0.6% to 0.9%. So most of the kind of dampening of it is our expectation of these efficiency standards. And there's kind of no question that this is coming with these CFL bulbs principally. The question -- the very difficult part for all of us is exactly when does it work through and how much of it comes through. So we've assumed it comes in over 3 to 4 years, and becomes completely saturated. But frankly, we don't know what kind of inventories are out there in folks' homes of incandescent bulbs that they can use over time. So that's the biggest factor.", "Operator", "The next question will be from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.", "Andrew Levi", "I'm sorry if you've talked about this in your formal comments, I've just been hopping around calls here. But what was -- what prompted you to take the high end of your growth rate up to 6%, which we were happy to see?", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Yes, Andy, this is Kevin. We've had these discussions on the calls, I think ever since we lowered the rate, as to when we might be able to move it back up. We talked last year and we watched carefully as we tried to figure out exactly what was going on in the economy. We saw glimpses of movement both in the customer usage, as well as the growth rate. We hadn't seen anything that we felt like was more of a trend until we got towards the end of the year. Based on our analysis, I guess we would say we see a light at the end of the tunnel now rather than a flicker, and we felt confident raising that top end combined with the growth we expect to see from the Base Load Review Act increases. But we still a left a 3% on the bottom end just in case the economy does take a turn on us or we see more of an impact from the CFLs that Jimmy talked about earlier. But I think just all in all, it's a little firmer confidence from our feeling of what the opportunities are and the growth we see in the population in South Carolina, as well as just a more continuous stream of average usage going up rather than being up 1 month and down the next month. We see that a little more consistent.", "Andrew Levi", "And I think you probably mentioned this, too, and I probably missed it. So you moved the equity out a year, which you had scheduled to do for '13. Was that a function of bonus depreciation or what was the reason for that?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. Andy, it's really a function of several things. But one, I would say the inflation on the overall project continues to be less than we had expected. Project to date now, it's about $600 million less total projected escalation or inflation on the project than we had planned at the outset when it was approved. Hence, the overall projected cost is now down from $6.3 billion to about $5.7 billion. And if -- you know our strategy is 50-50 debt and equity financing, so half of that comes from equity, so that's kind of a permanent dampering on the need for equity. And then bonus depreciation certainly contributed some to that, as well as some of the just -- better results on customer growth and customer usage. The retained earnings as a part of that helps offset it, too. [indiscernible] Sorry, to finish up, we will take down the equity forward here next month before the end of the first quarter, and that's $200 million from the deal we did back in 2010 and that keeps us in good shape.", "Andrew Levi", "And what was the benefit -- what's going to be the benefit of bonus depreciation in '13?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I think we estimate it to be maybe $80 million or something in that ballpark.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. So basically, you're below budget and on schedule on the nukes, pretty good.", "Andrew Levi", "That's right.", "Operator", "The next question will be from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I guess, just the one last one I'll add is, the 3% to 6% using $3.20 as a base, that's 3% to 6% is basic earnings per share growth?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "So what might that look like on a diluted basis, as these issuances come out and as the share count changes over time?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, the dilutive effect, at least prospectively, will be eliminated once we take this forward down next month. So that dilution calculation will require to use that treasury method just like you would you be for options or something of that nature. But it's not like an option in executive comp where it's not the company's option as to when it happens, it's the individual's option. This is always -- we were the driver of it. I've been a little frustrated with the dilutive calculation related to the forward because it's such as theoretical animal, but I really haven't computed it going forward. There'll be some tail period until it works out of the historical calculations, but it will not be applicable prospectively.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Sure, that makes perfect sense. And similarly, the 2013 guidance, again, that's basic but dilutive probably won't look too different, is that a fair assumption?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. I think that's a fair assumption.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we have a question from John Alli at Decade Capital.", "John Alli", "I apologize, but I was hopping on just as you guys were starting the commentary around the dividend growth. I was wondering if you might just be able to recap that quickly?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Sure. Well, our policy is 55% to 60% payout, so we've been a little over our policy statement the last few years just due to the pullback in earnings around the recession. So the strategy that we've recommended and our board's endorsed over the last 3 years has been to grow dividends at the smaller rate than earnings growth to get back within that cap. So we're almost back there now. Growth rate on the dividend was about 2.5% this year, higher than the last couple of years, but still smaller than the earnings growth rate of about 6%. So we're about back where we need to be. And once we're completely inside that cap, we would expect to grow dividends fairly consistently with earnings. Now there may be some years when earnings are a little lumpy with rate increases and things like that, and we intend to take a longer-term view on dividends to kind of flatten some of that out.", "John Alli", "Great. Any color on the timing of the '14 equity?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, not at this point. I mean, we'll continue to monitor the project construction. We'll continue to monitor what Congress might do. I mean, hey, they could come up with some more bonus depreciation or something like that, so I really don't have anything specific at this point. And we need to watch what inflation does as well because if it continues to come down, that could haircut some of the total amount and the timing of when this is needed.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Marsh for his closing comments.", "Kevin B. Marsh", "Thank you. Let me summarize by saying we are pleased with the results for 2012. The abnormal weather during the year presented some challenges for us, but I was pleased with the management team as they rose to meet that challenge and their efforts resulted in a strong finish for the year. Our nuclear construction continues to progress, as Steve discussed, and although we have some challenges, we continue to focus on bringing the 2 new plants online during 2017 and 2018, respectively.", "Thanks for joining us today and for your continuing interest in SCANA. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation.

Morgan Asset Management, Inc.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Timothy M. Winter - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Andrew Levi", "Operator", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 25, 2013. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron W. Hinson", "Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2013. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.", "During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and economic development in our service territory. Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at SCANA.com.", "Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Thanks, Byron, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the first quarter of 2013 were $1.13 per share compared to $0.93 per share in the same quarter of 2012. Higher electric and gas margins were primarily offset by increases in CapEx-related costs, such as depreciation, property taxes, interest expense and share dilution. Our results during the first quarter of 2013 were slightly better than our forecast, due primarily to timing of O&M expenses.", "As we projected in our February call, we took down the 6.6 million shares under our equity forward during March. For the remainder of the year, we expect comparable basic earnings per share to moderate due to the related dilution.", "Now on Slide 4, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's first quarter 2013 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.13 compared to 2012, driven largely by base rate increases along with customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in interest and depreciation expenses, and share dilution.", "PSNC Energy's earnings for the first quarter 2013, shown in red, were $0.24 per share and consistent with the first quarter of 2012. Increases in margin due to customer growth were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation expenses.", "SCANA Energy, the company's retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported first quarter 2013 earnings of $0.16 per share compared to $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2012. The increase is primarily attributable to a return to normal weather.", "SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported earnings of $0.05 per share, consistent with the first quarter of 2012.", "Next, I would like to touch on sales growth, as shown on Slide 5. We continue to see growth in weather-normalized sales volumes. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2013, total weather-normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were up approximately 2.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Industrial sales were down approximately 0.9%, primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire, as we've discussed in prior quarters.", "As we have mentioned previously, we evaluate weather-normalized sales on a 12-month rolling basis in order to capture an entire business cycle. Because of this, the impact of the fire is reflected in our industrial volumes. Excluding the impact of the fire, we estimate industrial sales would have increased approximately 0.5%, while total weather-normalized retail sales would have increased approximately 1.4%.", "On the bottom left-hand side of the slide, you will find the information about economic trends in our service territories. We continue to be encouraged by the level of economic development activity, with approximately $1.1 billion announced investment and over 2,600 jobs in our Carolinas territories this year. A significant portion of these investments and jobs are due to a recent announcement by Boeing Corporation that plans to invest another $1 billion and add at least 2,000 more jobs at its North Charleston campus.", "Our electric customer base grew at a rate of 0.8% this past quarter, continuing to show stable growth. Growth at our regulated gas businesses in South and North Carolina continues to be strong. As of March 2013, those rates were 1.8% for SCE&G gas and 2.2% for PSNC. PSNC had its best growth rate since 2008. PSNC also hit a milestone this quarter, as they exceeded 500,000 customers.", "Slide 6 presents our CapEx forecast, which has not changed since our previous earnings call. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending, as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report filed on February 13, and reflects our new CapEx budget for 2013 through 2015.", "Along the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental nuclear CWIP as of June 30. This represents the incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated. As you can see from the slide, we're beginning to enter a period of nuke -- peak nuclear spending.", "Please turn to Slide 7 to review our financing plan. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2017, and is also consistent with the forecast on our last call. As I mentioned, we settled our equity forward, resulting in the issuance of 6.6 million shares in early March. We don't anticipate any additional equity issuances for the balance of 2013, other than through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans. We continue to anticipate new First Mortgage Bond issuances to support new nuclear construction later in the year.", "Please turn to Slide 8. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 basic earnings per share, along with our internal target of $3.35 per share. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period, based on 2012 GAAP basic earnings per share of $3.20.", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy, and let me start by addressing an issue we have been dealing with since last year, but has gained notoriety in the past few days based on a press release issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday. SCE&G has requested a regulatory conference with the NRC, based on the NRC's preliminary categorization of a finding during a construction inspection. The NRC assigned a color coding -- sorry, the NRC assigns a color coding to findings based on their determination of safety significance. The range of colors is green, white, yellow and red, with green being the least significant. A green finding is defined as one of having very low safety significance. In this instance, we were preliminary issued a white finding, the next lowest level, which indicates a low to moderate safety significance. We have not previously received a finding of greater than green on a construction, and we believe that this one should also be green, which is why we requested the conference.", "This is not a new issue, having first been raised last September, and we have discussed it on previous earnings calls. It deals with shear reinforcement spacing and the use of T-heads in the concrete basemat. We corrected the problem prior to pouring the basemat, which was completed on March 11, and no additional work on the basemat will be needed, regardless of the outcome of this conference.", "In addition, we identified a similar condition that exists in other wall sections of the nuclear island. We are submitting license amendment requests, or LARs, to document the change and gain NRC approval, and we expect to receive those LARs shortly. And we'll then be able to begin pouring these wall sections. We continue to anticipate that Unit 2 will become operational in 2017 and Unit 3 in 2018.", "I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 9. As I mentioned previously, in March, we completed the placement of the nuclear island basemat, sometimes referred to as first nuclear concrete, or FNC. That event marked the first new such construction of nuclear concrete to be poured in the United States in 3 decades. Basemat provides a foundation for the containment building, shield building and auxilliary building that make up the nuclear island. Measuring 6 feet in thickness, the basemat covered a surface totaling 32,000 square feet, and it took just over 50 hours of continuous pouring to complete. We're very pleased with the collaborative efforts of our partners in making this concrete pour a success.", "Please turn now to Slide 10. At the beginning of April, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the Unit 2 basemat. This module had been previously assembled on-site and was lifted into place using the heavy lift derrick. CR-10 supports the containment vessel. One of the next steps for Unit 2 will be to set the containment vessel bottom head in the CR-10 module. The bottom head has also been previously assembled on-site.", "On the top left of Slide 11, you can see a picture of the switchyard. The switchyard was energized and turned over to SCE&G in January of this year. This gives us the ability to back feed to the 2 new nuclear plants to perform testing when the time comes. At the top right of that same slide, you will see a picture of cooling tower 2 Alpha. Progress on all 4 low-profile forced-draft cooling towers continues to progress as anticipated.", "On the bottom left, you will see the Unit 2 turbine building. The basemat for the Unit 2 turbine building is complete and the forming and pouring of the walls has begun. At bottom right, you will see a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Leveling concrete has been poured and the lower mud mat is complete. Installation of the waterproof membrane in the upper mud mat will be completed in the coming months, and the basemat will follow. Again, the schedule continues to support commercial operation dates in 2017 for Unit 2 and 2018 for Unit 3.", "As you can see on Slide 12, we have 2 Base Load Review Act, or BLRA filings coming up in May. Around mid-May, we will file our quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And on May 30th, we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. Both of these filings will be made available for review in the Investor Relations section of SCANA.com", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Travis Miller with MorningStar.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Wondering if you can walk through some of the cost implications that might be related to the NRC finding, the meeting, anything related to that, potentially?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Travis, this is Steve Byrne. At this point in time, we are still hopeful that we will be able to make our case that this is a lower safety significant item than the NRC, perhaps, preliminary thought it was. And that -- if that's the case, we won't see any changes to the cost of the project based on this. Really, when you look at the significance determination process that the NRC goes through in categorizing these findings, even if it were to be categorized as a white finding, what that would mean for us is increased inspection. And of course, I don't know at this point how much increased inspection. That really becomes a burden on our staff, the cost of which would be difficult to quantify. But there is no direct correlation to say that if you get a finding, it's going to cost you x, because we would not anticipate a fine from this. So from a cost point of view, we don't think it's going to be material.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And that relates to the capital investment, potentially, or CapEx. Also, you won't expect to see much impact on that side?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "That's correct, we would not.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.", "Moseh Yang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "This is Moseh for Julien. Just a quick question on retail. Any chance if you guys could give us an update on your outlook and expectations for retail in Georgia prospectively?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. It really hasn't changed since what we guided at the year-end call in February. So we expect that business, on a normal weather basis, to be about $0.18 to $0.20 a share in earnings for 2013. And the first quarter of 2013 was normal. It's just that the first quarter of '12 as compared to was so abnormal, almost 50% below in heating degree days. So we're right on track so far.", "Moseh Yang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just going back to nuclear for a second. Just kind of help us understand how this safety violation kind of differs from Southern's rebar issue?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "It's the same issue. The rebar issue that they had at Southern initially was the same issue that we had. And in fact, it came up at our plant. So when we talk about the rebar issue for the basemat, this is the same issue. And again, it was corrected prior to us pouring the basemat, and the same thing would be the case for Southern, corrected prior to them pouring their basemat. So there's no impact to the basemat from this violation.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.", "Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.", "I wondered if I could ask you to review again, you said you need to file another license amendment request for the walls. I wondered if you could just go through that again.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Sure. Similar to the way we handled the basemat, we filed a license amendment request to handle the changes that we wanted to make to the basemat. And if you remember that issue probably from our last earnings call, we did some physical changes to the reinforcing bar in the basemat, and we also changed the applicable code section from the concrete code, from one section to another. So for the wall section, we're going to do the same thing. So we'll change the reference from ACI 349 to ACI 318, and then we'll do some physical changes to the reinforcing bar itself. Now those -- for the lower levels, the critical sections, the ones that we're going to need next, we have already submitted that license amendment request to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and expect approval of that relatively soon. And we think that, more than likely, there will be other license amendment requests for the upper levels, these will be levels that obviously we won't be needing for some time, in the months or years to come.", "Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.", "So I guess this license amendment request process, is it getting a little bit more streamlined? And when the first one was filed, it was sort of potentially a big deal. Now is it just more, \"Oh, we have a change here, we have a change there?\" It's not likely to be hung up at the NRC for any extended period of time?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Leslie, I think as with everything else, the more often you do it on our side and on the regulator side, they become more efficient at handling and processing them, so I do expect some efficiencies to be gained there. But to their credit, even with the basemat license amendment requests and preliminary approval request that we submitted, the NRC did exactly what they said that they would do and pretty well followed their timeline. So we have no complaints about how expeditiously they processed those changes, and we would anticipate similar handling of these changes.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just some nuts and bolts questions. First of all, O&M was basically flat on a year-over-year basis. Just curious, because when you -- in some of your prior slides from last year, you outlined some of the pressures, like pension, like environmental cost, that were embedded in the rate case, but would also create upward movement in O&M. It didn't look like that flowed through. Just kind of would love your thoughts on what happened there.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Sure. Those costs did flow through. The reason they might not appear on the surface is they were offset by other kind of reductions. We had 2 or 3 things going on in the first quarter that will relate to, what we call, internally timing. They're going to show up later in the year rather than in the first quarter when we initially expected, and let me give you a couple of examples. We had some really -- we had a really mild January, and we had a really wet and cold February and March. Overall, it was statistically normal. So for example, the Georgia business ended up, like I said earlier, with normal weather. However, with very mild weather in January and the colder weather at the end of the quarter, we really didn't see the same level of bad debts or write-offs that we had expected in Q1. A lot of those bills are just showing up in April and May to the customers. So we expect there may be a couple of cents of that, that trickles over into Q2. We didn't have any significant storms that would require us to hit our storm deductible, which is $2.5 million a year, before we go against our storm reserve. We didn't hit any of that, but we had hit some of it in the past comparative quarter. We were lower than expected on our vegetation management, our tree trimming in Q1, because of that wet weather prevented the guys from being out there and executing on some of those plans. So those were some of the things that were really netting and offsetting those costs that are there, that we discussed earlier.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And so when we think about what's embedded in your 2013 guidance, what should we assume kind of year-over-year O&M growth?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, well, as we discussed a couple of months ago on the year-end call, I said, overall, we expected to be in the close to 5% range. And about half of that is driven by amortized costs that are coming out of the rate case order, pension costs, those kinds of things. So on the net, at this point, I really see it maybe being slightly less than that, maybe 4% to 4.5%, but not significantly less. I think it will still show up in the full overall period.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. So a little bit more back-end loaded rather than kind of spread? Like we were assuming it was just kind of spread evenly throughout the quarters.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. And frankly, we presumed some of that in our plan too, but we can't tell in advance what the weather's going to be and the rain's going to be and the storms. That's reality.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "One follow-on, just trying to get a feel for how much of the rate increases that were granted at SCE&G going into 2013, really just the core base rate, not the nuclear. How much of that has already been incurred that you benefited from versus what's left over to take rest of the year?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, it started January 1, so we've got a full quarter in there. And I don't know the exact cyclical breakdown of it. But net of those related costs, you and I were discussing earlier, it's probably $0.02 to $0.03 earnings contribution in Q1, net of those costs. But I don't really have the revenue breakdown on a cyclical basis.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And finally just from a reporting perspective, how do you all allocate the holding company debt when you show your segment EPS?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, that's really rolled up in the holdco and others in that category, that's not broken out in any of the separating opcos. So it remains in there netted with the others.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, you mentioned that you're still on track for 2017 and '18 for the new nuclear units. Is that still March and May, respectively?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Jonathan, we haven't had any changes to the in-service dates that we last took to our commission. Now with the Base Load Review Act order, we do have some schedule flexibility, and so it's 18 months before we would have to go back and say we were not on schedule. So as of this point in time, I don't have any information to say that we're going to be outside of the specific dates that we have in our last order, which you just mentioned, March and May.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, Jimmy, on the trailing 12-months weather-normalized retail sales growth of 1.4%, the adjusted amount, is that net of the energy efficiency efforts? I'm just kind of wondering since I believe your 2013 guidance embeds only 0.5% usage growth for the whole year.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, we're using 12 months rolling, so that's including 3 quarters from 2012 and the first quarter of '13. We try to do that, just take out some of the -- to get a full cycle in there. And I think what you were talking about, our plan for '13 obviously excludes those prior periods in 2012.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Right. But is the 1.4%, is that net of energy efficiency efforts? Because I know you're kind of indicating the 0.5% for 2013 reflected a headwind from some efficiency efforts, in particular, kind of CFL bulb adoption and stuff like that.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, net, we expect to be somewhere around 0.5% or slightly less overall retail growth.", "Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Does that mean -- I guess you feel pretty comfortable that, that's on the conservative side, if anything right now, based on how Q1 shaped up?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, I wouldn't really say that. I'd say I feel like it's pretty accurate at this point. I wouldn't characterize it as conservative or aggressive either way.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins", "Going to your Slide 6 on the CapEx, I was wondering if you could update what you've spent in the first quarter?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, Dan, I really don't -- I don't have that handy with me here now. But on the general part of the business other than generation, which tends to be projects and when we do those in the shoulder months, so either the spring or the fall, generally, the others is going to flow fairly ratably throughout the year. And the new nuclear, Steve, I don't know if you have any comments to characterize?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "I don't yet have the first quarter update.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, we really don't have that. I'm sorry.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And I was curious on the prior Slide 5, if you had -- could give any color? You talked a little bit about, on the industrial, what the impact for the customer with the fire. But have you seen any change in trend among the industrial classes, is that improving or about the same or any color related to that?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "It's really a case-by-case deal. In fact, I was looking over those a couple of days ago at our top 30 or 40 customers, and it's kind of a hodgepodge. There's not any one certain trend or it's not like all are flat, like the average is. As you might imagine, there's some volatility on both sides of that. Somewhat sector specific, there will be fits and starts with housing and chemicals and things of that nature, but nothing really stands out as a trend, Dan.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "You've already addressed most of them. Just a bookkeeping one, what was the basic and diluted share count ending the quarter, after the equity floor was drawn?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, Page 4 of the press release, right at the bottom of that page, you can get those. So basic, it was 134.4 million; diluted, 136.1 million.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Wasn't that the average for the quarter? I'm asking the ending.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "If you're looking for an ending...", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Like what's going forward, what should we be assuming?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, you're going to -- we're going to put that in the 10-Q. It will be filed in another week or so. But the year-end number, we took down 6.6 million shares. So I mean the actual number outstanding is just slightly under 140 million, but it will take a full 12 months for that to average into the annual average for sure.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tim Winter with Gabelli & Company.", "Timothy M. Winter - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "I was wondering if you could just kind of talk about some of the puts and takes with the equity going forward, your stock's hitting an all-time high again today. And the forward, how did that work out for you and what are you thinking going forward?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, well, I might just refer those over, if you have the slides nearby to Page 7, so nothing has changed since the last call on this. We still estimate about $500 million of equity in addition to that, that would come through our K and dividend reinvestment plans, and that would cover the balance of the construction of the projects. We indicate that in kind of that blue hash box because it may or may not occur just like it's laid out there on the chart. The forward helped us a great deal in that we did the forward originally in the middle of 2010. We had expected to take it down in 6 to 9 months based on the planned construction schedule. Because of the bonus depreciation stimulus passed by Congress, because of some of the change in our tax strategies, we really didn't need that cash at that point, so we extended the forward twice. So on one hand, it's really worked out well that we avoided the basic dilution for close to 3 years. On the other hand, the market -- frankly, you guys have been about 50-50, some have included it in -- you picked up diluted, some have picked up basic. So it's kind of a hodgepodge. So it certainly helped our actual earnings per share on a basic basis. But it's been a little bit of a disappointment that it's just an odd animal, as I've discussed before, and about half the market has followed on the diluted basis. So I just see it really different than options or something like that, so it does have that drawback. How we do it going forward? We're going to continue to monitor this. The good news is we don't need any more for the balance of the year, other than what we would get through the plans, which is kind of pro rata each quarter. And we'll watch the market and see what's going on, watch the projected inflation with the project and the project schedule. And it's just too early to tell any more about when or how we'll do that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Andy Levi with Avon Capital.", "Andrew Levi", "Actually, most of my questions were answered, but just a follow-up. I guess based on your comments, it's safe to kind of say that your opinion of a forward sale is not as favorable as it was since you've experienced the forward sale. Is that kind of what you're trying to say?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I'm glad we did it. I wish it did not come with the baggage of the dilution associated with it. Because again, about half of the market has focused on the diluted and about half have focused on basic. I wish it were clear there. But no, if I had to do it over again, knowing everything we know now, it would still be the best option, because it gave us that flexibility for such a period of time.", "Operator", "[indiscernible] question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Jimmy, real quick follow-up. Tax this year, how big of a difference do you expect between booked and GAAP in cash taxes? Or how impactful, how much do you expect in terms of cash flow related to bonus D&A?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, bonus D&A, we expect to be somewhere in the $70 million to $90 million range for 2013. And the effective tax rate, we projected at the beginning of the year and it's held through so far at about 32%. So I can't tell you exactly what the cash basis will be, but it will start ramping up here this year or so.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Meaning the $80 million of bonus D&A is basically the only major offset to book taxes you can imagine from a cash tax perspective?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, we've got one other one in that change in our tax strategy, the 263A, but it's not as significant as the bonus depreciation.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to now turn the conference back over to Mr. Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, thank you, and thank you, all. To summarize, we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter of 2013. We remain on track to meet our target and have met several major milestones with our new nuclear project. And finally, I want to again mention our upcoming Analyst Day event to be held in New York on June 5. Please mark your calendars and plan to attend either in person or online.

Hinson - Director of Investor Relations", "Jimmy E. Addison - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Stephen A. Byrne - Senior Vice President", "Analysts", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Andrew Levi", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Ashar Khan", "Operator", "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, August 1, 2013. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron W. Hinson", "Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the second quarter of 2013. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.", "During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and economic development in our service territory, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides in the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. And the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Thanks, Byron, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3.", "Basic earnings in the second quarter of 2013 were $0.60 per share compared to $0.55 per share in the same quarter of 2012. Higher electric and gas margins were principally offset by increases in CapEx-related costs, including interest expense, depreciation, property taxes and share dilution.", "Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2013, were $1.73 versus $1.48 in 2012. Similar to the quarter, increases in electric and gas margins were partially offset by higher expenses related to our capital program.", "Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's second quarter basic earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.04 compared to 2012, driven largely by base rate increases along with customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in operating and maintenance expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.17 due primarily to higher electric margin.", "PSNC Energy recorded seasonally flat earnings for the second quarter of 2013, comparable to the same period of last year. For the 6-month period ended June 30, shown in red, basic earnings were $0.24 per share, in line with the prior year. SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, shown in green, reported a seasonal loss of $0.02 cents per share for the second quarter, consistent with last year. Year-to-date earnings are up $0.08, primarily due to a return to normal weather during the first quarter of 2013. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the second quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in 2012. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported basic earnings per share of $0.04 in 2013, consistent with 2012.", "I'd like to touch on economic trends in our service territory as shown on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. Through the second quarter of this year, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $1.5 billion with expectations of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We're pleased that this year is shaping up to be another solid year in terms of economic development in our region. Driven by prior economic announcements, unemployment rates continue to improve. Announcements of new businesses, as well as business expansions, have translated into job creation. The unemployment rate in SCE&G's electric territory, denoted in blue, of 7% is 200 basis points better than during the peak of the recession and continues to be favorable compared to the national rate. Additionally, the U.S. Commerce Department released a survey in June noting that South Carolina led the Southeast in economic growth during 2012 with real GDP growth of 2.7%. Manufacturing is clearly playing a key role in South Carolina's economic growth.", "Slide 7 presents weather-normalized sales and customer growth. The top left outlines our weather-normalized sales for the 12 months ended June, which you can see have increased slightly. From the bottom of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. In addition to the aforementioned electric growth, our regulated gas businesses in South and North Carolina grew at 2%. SCE&G gas hit the 2% growth mark for the first time since the third quarter of 2007. As you will note on the top right, these results are in line with our expectations.", "Now I would like to speak about our operational and maintenance expenses for the year. As we've previously mentioned, our strategic goal for 2013 and beyond would be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. One of the instruments in achieving this goal is O&M cost control. We originally estimated during the year-end call that O&M expenses would be approximately 5% higher in 2013, with about half of that increase driven by a specific rate case-related expense amortization of previously deferred items. While these amortizations are occurring as projected, the other projected expense growth has been mitigated by cost-control efforts, such as lower labor cost and the delay of certain items. We constantly scrutinize the organization for efficiencies, which has principally been accomplished through attrition to mitigate other external cost increases.", "Now, please turn to Slide 8. Another factor is lower-than-planned vegetation management during the significant rainfall of the second quarter. Our crews have been able to trim approximately 300 fewer miles of transmission and distribution right of ways than they had at this point in 2012. South Carolina received substantial rainfall during the past quarter, as you can see in this picture from one of our transmission right of ways. While this photo is an extreme example, on average Colombia and Charleston, comprising the majority of our service area in SCE&G, had 15 inches of rain during the second quarter, which is approximately 50% above normal. This has kept our crews from being able to trim some of the right of ways, which has resulted in lower O&M compared to our plan. We expect most of this O&M will be spent during the balance of the year, assuming normal rainfall.", "Also, outages and projects at some of our coal-fired plants have shifted from the spring of 2013 to the fall, which have caused some timing variances compared to our plan. Considering the cost-control efforts and these type of timing items, we now project full year O&M expenses to grow approximately 3.5% over 2012 levels.", "Now, please turn to Slide 9, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.3 billion. As you can see from the items denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is composed of SCE&G Electric. In the block on the top right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return as of the end of the second quarter of 2013 was approximately 9.9%, virtually unchanged from Q1. Again, the strategic goal for 2013 and beyond will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. Control of O&M and nonnuclear CapEx, while monitoring and responding to margin fluctuations, is essential to achieving this goal.", "Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. We've had incremental CWIP in the last year of approximately $570 million, and we expect to implement a rate increase in November of just under 2.9%. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North Carolina and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to run those businesses close to those returns. Along the bottom of the page is our regulatory schedule outside of any Base Load Review Act or BLRA filings. These items are fairly routine annual filings.", "Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated with our high-level estimates of the changes in the construction cost timing due to the schedule delay we announced on June 5. These preliminary estimates reflect a delay in the in-service dates by up to 12 months for Unit 2 and a similar delay for Unit 3. The consortium, consisting of Westinghouse and CB&I, provided their preliminary estimates of the cash flow changes for Unit 2, but have yet to revise their estimates for Unit 3. We have prepared our own estimate internally to evaluate the impact of a similar deferral on Unit 3. To be clear, this is our current best estimate of the impact of the delay, and the numbers may shift intra-period as they are refined. These numbers do not include the potential increased costs of up to $200 million as we have not reached any further conclusions on those matters. Along the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.", "Please turn to Slide 11 to review the net change. This reflects the shift in construction cash flows due to the change in in-service dates. You will note that incremental CWIP from 2013 to 2015 is lower than filed in the last quarterly BLRA report and is higher beginning in 2016 for the duration of the construction. Steve will address nuclear construction in a few minutes.", "Please turn to Slide 12 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, we settled our equity forward, resulting in the issuance of 6.6 million shares in early March. We don't anticipate any additional equity issuances for the balance of 2013 other than through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans. Also in June, SCE&G issued $400 million in First Mortgage Bonds. $150 million of this issuance was used to refinance maturing First Mortgage Bonds, with the remainder used to repay short-term debt primarily incurred for construction of the new nuclear units. We've not made any changes in our financing plan at this point due to the shift in the in-service dates, as we do not expect the total cost of the project to change significantly. Once CB&I finalizes its analysis on the construction schedule and related costs, we will provide an update on our financing plans.", "Now, please turn to Slide 13. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 basic earnings per share along with our internal target of $3.35 per share. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on 2012 GAAP basic earnings per share of $3.20.", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to Slide #14. Let me start by addressing the topic we discussed at our Analyst Day event as it pertains to the new nuclear in-service dates and the associated costs.", "As we stated in New York, we expect Unit 2's in-service date to be between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, which is still within the Public Service Commission's 18-month scheduled contingency window for the currently approved in-service date, which is March of 2017. Although we have provided you with a high-level estimate to show the shift in CapEx spend, we continue to work with the Chicago Bridge & Iron to finalize how the construction cost will shift, as well as determine what the additional costs might be for this delay along with the associated responsibility. I want to reiterate that our estimated upper bound of the additional cost to SCE&G is approximately $200 million. We hope to get more definitive information later this year.", "I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 15. As I have mentioned previously, in March, we completed an over 50 hour continuous pour of nuclear island basemat, sometimes referred to as first nuclear concrete, for our first new unit, which can be seen in the picture at the top of the slide. The basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel shield building and auxiliary building that make up the nuclear island. At the beginning of April, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the Unit 2 basemat, which you can see at the bottom left of the slide. This module had been previously assembled on-site and was lifted into place using a heavy lift derrick. CR-10 supports the containment vessel. As you can see at the bottom right, the containment vessel bottom head, which was also assembled on-site, was lifted into place by the heavy lift derrick in May. The containment vessel will house numerous reactor system components, such as a reactor vessel, piping, steam generators and the pressurizer.", "On the top left of Slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel lower bowl as it begins to take shape on-site. The top right of that same slide, you will see a picture of Cooling Tower 2 Alpha. All 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continue to progress as anticipated. On the bottom left, you'll see the Unit 2 Turbine Building. Placement of the Unit 2 Turbine Building basemat and associated walls has been completed.", "At the bottom right, you'll see a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. We have completed the placement of the dental concrete, the leveling concrete, a lower mudmat, the vapor barrier and the upper mudmat. Currently, the reinforcing bar cage is being assembled, and we are on schedule for the first nuclear concrete Unit 3 some time around October of this year.", "Early this month, we set the first condenser section in the Unit 2 Turbine Building, which you can see on Slide 17. On the top is the lift from the condenser assembly area. On the bottom left is a mid-air shot. And on the bottom right is the placement in the Turbine Building basement.", "On Slide 18, you'll some components that have arrived on-site. Across the top, you'll see a photo of the Deaerator. I included this photo to show you the scale of this enormous item. It's about 140 feet long, 18 feet in diameter, and its purpose is to strip oxygen from the feedwater system. On the bottom left, you'll see a picture of the Unit 2 Reactor Vessel on-site. As I'm sure you're aware, the Reactor Vessel will house the fuel assemblies. On the bottom right, you'll see the low pressure turbine rotors, 2 Alpha and 2 Bravo as they arrive via railcars. There are 3 low pressure and 1 high pressure turbine rotors for each unit.", "Please now turn to Slide 19. As discussed at Analyst Day, in May we filed our Base Load Review Act or BLRA quarterly status update for this first quarter of 2013 with the Public Service Commission, as well as our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. The Office of Regulatory Staff has completed their review of our request and is recommending to the Commission a $67.2 million revenue increase or a rate increase of 2.87%. We concur with their recommendation and anticipate the requested increase in rates by November 1.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "One general question here. If you look out over the next 3 to 6 months, say the second half of the year, where do you see the biggest risk? Is it earnings or the operations in general? Is there something at the nuclear plant? Is it something back on just core operations at the utility, O&M? Are we just talking about weather? Where is the biggest risk, you think, to the performance in the second half?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, so this is Jimmy. I'll start off, and then let Steve jump in here later. I would say that I feel pretty good about the economy. We continue to see a lot of announcements, but the large industrials are really mixed. We are seeing some sectors, those related to housing and those related to automotive that are doing pretty well, and then some of the other sectors are really mixed. So that's a little bit uncertain, kind of like the national news on that front. O&M, I feel like we really got our hands around that and doing a really good job with that. As I said in the comments a few minutes earlier, I think we're in much better position there than we thought we would be 6 months ago. And then as it relates to weather, other than our Georgia business, all of our operations are weather-normalized, so that's really not an issue for us. And I'll let Steve speak to more about operations and the project.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "I think from the nuclear project perspective, the module deliveries out of the CB&I Lake Charles facility is probably our biggest concern. And when we had in Analyst Day in June in New York, we had just received the new schedule from the CB&I Lake Charles facility for some modules delivery to site. And that prompted us to reevaluate the in-service date for the units. Since that timeframe, they have been beating that schedule. So that's good news, but it's not a real long trend. So we're still watching the module facility very closely.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Great. That's helpful. And then just one clarification question. Over the last few months here you shifted the spending from the nuclear plant, but no additional spending. And then you gave a the guidance around the potential for the $200 million. I'm just -- am I getting that very simply correct?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, that's right. And remember, the estimate of the $200 million was our estimate, not the consortium's estimate, of what we think the additional charges could be. But we haven't yet sorted out, let's say, responsibility for some of those charges. So we anticipate that we're going to be doing that over the remainder of this year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.", "Andrew Levi", "Just on the O&M, could we just go over that again, just so I understand? I mean, you were pretty clear on it, but just -- so originally, you were expecting a 5% increase in O&M, which half of that was from things that you're getting back from rate cases, right?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right. And those are, if you will, fixed -- on fixed amortization. So that hasn't changed.", "Andrew Levi", "And then you expected another 2.5% kind of base O&M growth on top of that, but now you're saying that's going to be 1% for a total of 3.5%. Is that kind of the way to think of it?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right. And largely, that delta from our earlier projection to kind of our projection as to where we are today, has really been driven off of labor and labor-related costs. We're, I don't know, 100, 125 or so full-time equivalents down from where we were a year ago aside from the new nuclear project, which those costs are being capitalized as part of the project. But we continue to just look for opportunities through attrition and the operations for efficiency.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay, so that's something that's sustainable and doesn't have to do with the weather or tree trimming or planned outages...", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Absolutely.", "Andrew Levi", "All that stuff. Okay. So we should carry that through?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay, great. That sounds good. And then on the sales side. I know you don't have it in your slides. But do you have any quarterly data for the second quarter, residential, commercial, industrial, weather-normalized sales?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, Andy, we really don't present that. It's just, it doesn't have a full cyclical nature of the business in it. So we tend to just report the 12-month weather-adjusted.", "Andrew Levi", "Any flavor you can give us without being specific?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Not really.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay, fair enough.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I mean other than comments I made earlier about industrials, et cetera -- I mean look, overall, the RNC market continues to be very conscious of usage. So we grew customers at 0.8% percent, but overall usage is up 0.2% or so. So you can tell that, although you're adding new customers at a higher rate than your overall consumption's growing, then the rest of the base is using less on average. Part of that is just good news from the effectiveness of some of the demands on management programs that we're promoting, the CFL light bulbs, et cetera. Some of those are really taking effect.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. And then the last question I have is just on the timing/method of new equity. Any color you can -- I mean, obviously, you said no new equity this year. Does that include a possible forward sale? If we should assume that there's no activity this year? Or is that just on the share count type of thing?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, we really haven't made any decisions around that, Andy, so I can't be absolutely definitive on it. But I'll tell you that we really don't see any need until the second half of '14 at the earliest for the actual cash. And these recent delays in the cash flow that both Stephen and I spoke about only kind of take additional pressure off of that need. So we're not anxious about doing anything in the near term.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. So the last thing -- but on top of that, as far as on the equity, kind of looking at that earnings are coming in a little bit better, O&M, a little bit better. Is it possible that the amount of equity that's needed in the future could change, or are we kind of set in stone at this point?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Certainly not set in stone. It could be impacted by the factors you mentioned. It could be impacted by the actual inflation that occurs as we build out the projects. So one of the most significant variables is the escalation, and we have to project that. And you may recall that we're roughly, today, projecting the total project, SCE&G's share, to cost about $0.5 billion less than when we started the project. And that's largely driven by lower inflation. Now, that could go lower, that could go higher. And if it did, generally, it would impact equity $0.50 on the dollar and debt, $0.50 on the dollar.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. And obviously, debt expenses have been lowered because of lower interest rates in general, so...", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Absolutely. And those benefits will anew for 30 years, because we're doing 30-year fixed-rate debt.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "First question, I just want to clarify, maybe if you can repeat what you said about any changes to the CapEx. It's changes of timing related to the delays, but that does not include your estimate of up to $200 million of additional cost, did I hear that right?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's correct. All we've done is shift the cost for where we think it will occur now. But as Steve said, we've not done anything to incorporate the $200 million because, one, it's just our internal estimate, we've not got it from the consortium. And two, when we do get something from them, there will be a lot of discussion and negotiation around whose responsibility that is.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And you said that, that's the fundamental plan over the rest of the year. Is your expectation that say, by the end of the calendar year, you'll have a better sense of that, of the sharing in the total costs?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "We would anticipate that by end of the calendar year, we certainly would have a better understanding of both the cost and the cash flows of those costs. But again, if we get into the negotiation process, that could be protracted based on our previous history. It's not to say that it's overly contentious. It just takes a long time to work through who we think is responsible for what portions of the cost.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Then on the changes to the CapEx, they're a bit bigger than I was expecting since the Analyst Day. Can you maybe talk a little bit about why the numbers are 3 digits or 3 -- or almost 200 million for this year?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, I think you need to keep that in perspective. Let me just start off with this and see if Steve wants to add anything. But if you look at that net change at the bottom on the 12 months ended June here, down in the blue bar, that's what's going to drive the BLRA proceedings. The $141 million shift, we estimate at June of '14 is just slightly more than 10% of the CWIP we expect that occur -- incur during that period. So while they look significant outside of context, you put them in context, it's really about 10%, which doesn't surprise me when you're looking at moving the delivery data, the project by 9 to 12 months, and you've got 4 or 5 years left to build on it. That's not surprising to me.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's pretty helpful. Then just want to go back to the question on the weather-normalized sales growth. I understand you don't want to get too specific on the quarterly moves, but these are some pretty dramatic changes from the 12 months ended in March. Residential, in particular, was 2.5%, now it's barely over 0. I noticed you kind of took out the commentary about the industrial customer that was down, and you added this comment that it was adjusted for the leap year. Is this change mostly a change in the actual trends or in your presentation and accounting for it?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, it's not really a change in the accounting. We're dropping the industrial customer that has been down in the past because most of this tail period now has the industrial customer back in that production that they were in before, so it's not -- it's more of an apple and apple now without any type of adjustment. And then we talked about the leap year last year when it was a positive, so we'll talk about it now as it's a negative. We're just trying to be consistent. And if you really put these -- if you look on that Slide 7, up in that box on the top right, they're really fairly consistent with what we expected when we put our plan together. So yes, sales growth is slightly less than we had expected. Customer growth is about what we expected. But O&M costs are less than we had expected. So we try to really balance that 3-legged stool, and those are the key 3 levers for us.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay. So if I can ask it a different way then, even though it looks like the second quarter growth really, really collapsed, you're still confident that, that was not a new normal, and that the second half, we'll see a somewhat meaningful recovery back toward the trend lines that you had expected?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, I can't predict the future, that's for sure. But I still feel confident about our overall plan for the year and our ability to monitor and adjust to the customer margins. And look, we still have growth. I mean the electric new customers are as high as they've been since prerecession. The SCE&G gas business hit 2% growth this year in new customers for the first time since 2007 in the housing boom. So we're adding a lot of new customers. And PSNC was similar to North Carolina, about 2% growth. The issue is, I think, just general, folks' general uncertainty with the economy. And is that going to be better in the second half of the year? I don't know. I mean, we've got a lot of discussion that's going to fill up the TV and the Internet. And in the third quarter with Congress bickering over debt ceilings and budgets and tax reform and things of that nature, I'm not sure how that makes folks feel a lot better about their pocketbook.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay. I'm try one different way to ask the same question then. If the second quarter trend of slowing growth is continued, you've already announced these cost controls in lower O&Ms. Are there more bullets you could throw at this problem, or if -- or is that kind of it? And at this point, you're hoping for a recovery in sales growth to hit your internal target for the year.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "We do not need sales growth to \"recover\" to hit any internal targets. We were confident of our plan for the year based on the actions we've taken today, because as our early -- earlier question that asked me, I said really, these cuts that you have made, these attrition and labor retirements, I mean those folks aren't coming back to work. Those cost reductions are there and in place.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just -- and I hate to be the dead horse here, my apologies. I just want to make sure I understand O&M. When you're talking about O&M, you're talking company-wide, not just SCE&G?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So company wide year-over-year, 3.5% increase from the 2012 GAAP reported nonfuel O&M.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right, and a little over 2/3 of the related to those fixed amortizations at SCE&G from the rate case.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And those fixed amortizations, so that's not a cash -- that's a noncash O&M cost?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right. Well, at least, noncash in '13. It was cash at some point in the past and just deferred until the rate proceeding last year.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Since you're moving nuclear capital spending down, why not -- before '13 and '14, why not revise down financing needs?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, as I think I said in the comments, Michael, if I didn't, let me be clearer now. We're constantly monitoring that plan. What you see here in the CapEx shift is our internal estimates, largely. So we need to get these refined from the consortium and have more concrete numbers. And if those warrant shifting to capital plans some, we will. The good news is we're not -- we don't have anything in the immediate headlights that we're about to pull the trigger on that's irreversible. As I said earlier, I don't see us doing anything in the equity markets until the second half of '14 at the earliest. So there's nothing in the near term that says, let's make a decision today that's going to impact '14 or '15 before you get all the information you'd like. I'd rather have more information over the next 6 months and make a better decision.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Completely agree. Last items, and these are both nuclear related. When you think about the move out of the $224 million from the '13 to '15 timeframe, into '16 and beyond, and the potential for some cost inflation up to $200 million, what is that -- which year then becomes the peak CapEx year? It was supposed to be kind of '14, '15-ish timeframe. Does that change, and is the peak year a different year now going forward?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I think Slide 10 really is our best estimate today to answer your question. That's where we've estimated the changes. And you can see down at the bottom -- we stick on our corporate-wide CapEx to the 3 years that's in the K. That's why you see '13, '14, '15 presented. But if you look down below, you'll see how we've recapped this for you on June 30 year-end basis related to the project. So you can still see that June of '14, we still project to be the peak capital year, and then it starts to taper down from there.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I want to make sure, so the blue bar down there, that's the June to June nuclear CapEx?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the data you're showing in the table above, that's the new adjusted nuclear CapEx or...", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right, on a calendar basis. And down below is also adjusted, but on a mid-year basis because that's how the BLRA is driven.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. But neither of which include the potential for any cost increases, whether it's $10 million or $200 million or whatever you guys in the consortium wind up negotiating?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's correct.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "Jimmy, I was just trying to -- sorry I joined a little bit late coming in from another call. I mean the first half, you did 50% of earnings. And as you've done so well, did you mention that you can be in the top end of the range for the year, or why not?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, I didn't mention that. I did mention, though, in my earlier comments that there were certain items that we had expected to expend in the first half of the year that we were not able to because of the weather. We were specifically, we've trimmed about 300 miles less of right of ways than we had hoped to and planned to at this point during the year and than we had last year, just because it's been so wet in the area. Our rainfall's up 50% above normal just in the first 6 months of the year. So the short of that is we expect some of that to turn around in the latter half of the year, unless we continue to have incredibly high rainfall.", "Ashar Khan", "But isn't there been higher rainfall, that's what Southern told us, in the whole month of July as well and continuing into August?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, we're only $0.5 billion in August. I wouldn't get too far into predicting August right now, but there has been more into July.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay, okay. So you don't think -- so you're above plans for the year or no? That's my basic question right now.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "We still feel confident about our internal target. And we'll reevaluate that as we get through the third quarter. The second quarter's only 15% of our operating plan for the year just because of the cyclical nature of our businesses. So really, you really need to get through to Q3 before we size up where we are and make any tight estimates for the year.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. And can we still expect guidance as you've gone back for '14 on the third quarter call?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Now, that's our plan.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, thank you very much. And to summarize, we're pleased with the results through midyear. We remain on track to meet our internal target and continue to focus on providing safe and reliable energy, while also staying focused on the execution of the PC summer construction project. I want to thank you, all, for us today, and thank you for your interest in SCANA.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded.

I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, October 31, 2013. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron W. Hinson", "Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2013. Joining us on the call today are: Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory and regulatory activity. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we'll respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.", "I would also like to mention that we recently began a new process of posting new nuclear project-related information directly to our website at scana.com. On the SCANA homepage, there's a yellow box containing a link to the new nuclear section of the website. That section contains a yellow box with a link to project-related news and updates. It is possible that some of the information that we've posted from time to time may be deemed material information that does not otherwise become public. This new process replaces our prior practice of furnishing a Form 8-K, the quarterly reports that SCE&G submits to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff in connection with SCE&G's new nuclear project. Instead, the company now posts copies of those reports in the new nuclear section on the SCANA website.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. And the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Thanks, Byron, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the third quarter of 2013 were $0.94 per share compared to $0.93 per share in the same quarter of 2012. Higher electric and gas margins were principally offset by increases in CapEx-related items, including depreciation, property taxes and share dilution and a minor increase in O&M.", "Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, were $2.67 versus $2.41 in 2012. Similar to the quarter, increases in electric and gas margins were partially offset by higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program and minor increases in O&M.", "Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter basic earnings, denoted in blue, were down $0.01 compared to 2012. Earnings were $139 million for the third quarter of 2013 compared to $132 million for the third quarter of 2012. Higher margins from base rate increases, along with customer growth, were offset by increases in operating and maintenance expenses as well as CapEx-related costs, including property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.16, due primarily to higher electric and gas margins. PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 for the third quarter of 2013, in line with the same period of last year. For the 9-month period ended September 30, shown in red, basic earnings were $0.21 per share, also in line with the prior year.", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, shown in green, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter, consistent with last year. Year-to-date earnings are up $0.09, primarily due to a return to normal weather during first quarter of 2013. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been granted a 1-year extension to serve as the regulated provider for the state of Georgia. This additional year will be added on to the current 2-year term and will end in August 2015. SCANA Energy has served as the regulated provider since the program's inception in 2002. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported flat earnings in the third quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in 2012. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported basic earnings per share of $0.04 in 2013 compared to $0.03 in 2012.", "Now I would like to speak about our operation and maintenance expenses for the year. As we've previously mentioned, our strategic goal for 2013 and beyond will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. One of the instruments in achieving this goal is O&M cost control. We estimated during the Q2 call that O&M expenses would be approximately 3.5% higher in 2013 with 2.5% driven by specific rate case-related expense and amortizations of previously deferred items. While these amortizations are occurring as projected, the other projected expense growth has been mitigated by cost control efforts, such as lower labor cost. Currently, we have approximately 100 fewer employees, excluding our nuclear construction activity, than we had at the end of September 2012. The reduced headcount, along with lower incentive compensation accruals, have resulted in lower O&M labor cost of approximately $10 million compared to last year. These savings have offset increases in pension cost, which were anticipated in our electric rate order, and higher health care costs. Considering the cost control efforts, we now project full year O&M expenses to grow at approximately 2.5% over 2012 levels or basically flat, excluding the rate case-related items.", "I'd like to touch on economic trends in our service territory as shown on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. Through the third quarter of this year, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $1.75 billion with expectations of creating approximately 7,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We are pleased that this year is shaping up to be another solid year in terms of economic development in our region. You can see that the national unemployment rate, along with the 3 states where SCANA has a presence. The unemployment rate in SCE&G's electric territory, denoted in blue, of 7%, is 200 basis points better than during the peak of the recession. And both continues to be favorable compared to the national rate and continues to decline due to the industrial expansion. The Port of Charleston continues to see increased traffic and finished this June 2013 fiscal year with container volume up 9%. Also going into fiscal year 2014, the port handled approximately 145,000 units in August, which is the highest recorded monthly volume since October of 2008. Year-to-date, fiscal year 2014 container volumes are up 4.5% over the prior year and 1.8% ahead of their plan. As I mentioned before, it's estimated that 1 of every 5 jobs in South Carolina is related to port volume. This increased traffic is a very good sign for the local economy.", "Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see accelerating customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric growth is 1.3%, the highest it's been since the first quarter of 2009. And SCE&G's gas growth is at 2.2%, its highest level since the third quarter of 2007. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina grew at 2%. The bottom table outlines our weather normalized kilowatt hour sales for the quarter in the 12 months ended September 30. Overall, weather normalized sales were down 0.9% for the quarter and 0.6% on a 12-month ended basis. Industrial sales are showing the most improvement, driven by the expansion discussed earlier but are more than offset by the residential and commercial decline. As I've mentioned previously, there continues to be uncertainty around residential average use, driven by conservation, CFL lightbulb adoption rates and more energy-efficient appliances. As our customers change their spending habits, we tightened our O&M cost control. I also believe the uncertainty in Washington has been a serious concern to all and has likely impacted spending habits.", "Please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.2 billion. You can see from the items denoted in the 2 shades of blue approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the top right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The third quarter earned return in electric business is approximately 9.7%. Again, our strategic goal for 2013 and beyond will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. Control of O&M and non-new nuclear CapEx while monitoring and responding to margin fluctuations is essential to achieving this goal.", "Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. The South Carolina PSC recently approved our request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $570 million to our rate base. And we will implement a rate increase in November of just under 2.9%. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina respectively, and we continue to run those businesses close to those returns. Along the bottom of the page is our regulatory schedule outside of any Base Load Review Act or BLRA filings. These items are fairly routine annual filings.", "Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast was updated using the preliminary estimated BLRA third quarter quarterly report cash flows and reflects lower escalation and a shift in the in-service dates by up to 12 months for Unit 2 and a similar delay for Unit 3 as we've previously presented. Along the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.", "Please turn now to Slide 10 to review the net change. This reflects the shift in construction cash flows due to the change in, in-service dates and the lower escalation. You will note that incremental CWIP from 2014 to 2016 is lower than filed in the last quarterly BLRA report driven by the lower escalation. Steve will provide an update on nuclear construction in a few moments.", "Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. Earlier this year, we settled our equity forward, resulting in the issuance of 6.6 million shares in early March. And we do not anticipate any additional equity issuances for the balance of 2013 other than through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans. In June, SCE&G issued $400 million in first mortgage bonds. $150 million of this issuance was used to refinance maturing first mortgage bonds with the remainder used to repay short-term debt primarily incurred for construction of the new nuclear units. As a result of the shift in our nuclear spending and lower escalation, SCE&G will not need to issue any additional debt in 2013, eliminating the previously planned $200 million Q4 issuance. We do project that we will need an additional $50 million in the 2016, 2017 timeframe, but the overall debt plan has been reduced by $150 million over the remaining construction cycle.", "As it relates to our equity issuances, our additional equity needs, denoted in the blue box, are projected to be lower over the 4-year period by $75 million. The new projected additional equity is approximately $425 million rather than the previous estimate of $500 million. We now estimate that we will issue approximately $100 million in late 2014, $125 million in 2015 and $200 million in the 2016, '17 timeframe, reducing the overall equity plan by $75 million over the remaining construction period. Of course, the amounts and timing could change due to a change in inflation, bonus depreciation, the construction schedule or other factors. The financing plan, CapEx plan and in-service dates for Units 2 and 3 now reflect the current assessment of our new nuclear construction project.", "We're very pleased to report that earlier this month, we successfully extended our credit facility by 1 year. As you may recall, the committed lines of credit total $1.8 billion. $1.6 billion covers the entire 5 years and will expire in October 2018. And an additional $200 million, which was added for peak construction liquidity, covers 3 years and will expire in October 2016. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction and the tenors spans substantially all of the planned peak construction period of the new units. I would again like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and support of our nuclear expansion plans. We're also pleased that we received an excellent response for our liquidity needs during nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors.", "Now please turn to Slide 12. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 per basic earnings per share along with our internal target of $3.35 per share. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on 2012 GAAP basic earnings per share of $3.20. We plan to provide 2014 annual guidance in our year-end call in February.", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy. I will begin by providing an update on the schedule, a few details on the related costs, progress at CB&I and on-hook dates for our critical path components.", "Please turn to Slide 13. The company is affirming that we expect Unit 2's in-service date to be between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. This range is still within the Public Service Commission's 18-month scheduled contingency window for the currently approved in-service date, which is March of 2017. The in-service date for Unit 3 will be similarly delayed or roughly 12 months after Unit 2. The company is also affirming the previously reported upper-bound estimate of approximately $200 million of additional costs associated with this schedule change driven by 3 factors: owners cost, EPC cost and escalation. This $200 million represents SCE&G's 55% share of the project's cost including escalation.", "It is important to note that SCE&G has not accepted responsibility for any of the delay costs and expect to continue discussions with the consortium regarding responsibility for any increase. Additionally, our EPC contract provides for liquidated damages in the event of a delay in the completion of the facility, which have not been factored into our estimate and would also be included in discussions with the consortium. In summary, we believe SCE&G's responsibility for any portion of the $200 million estimate should ultimately be limited to substantially less, once all the relevant factors are considered.", "Now I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 14. CB&I Lake Charles has taken numerous steps in the last quarter to mitigate further delays to the project. Some of the changes include CB&I Lake Charles facility is now working 2 12-hour shifts 7 days a week. CB&I facility has also moved fabrication of several components to other vendors in an effort to relieve the burden on the facility. Fabrication of module CA-03 has been moved to Pegasus Steel's facility in North Charleston, South Carolina. Fabrication of shield building structural modules has been assigned to Newport News Industries or NNI. CB&I also moved fabrication of CA-04 to the V.C. Summer site for completion. As it relates to submodules, all of the submodules required to assemble CA-20 to be able to meet its on-hook date are now on-site at V.C. Summer. I'll address CA-20 and on-hook dates later in my comments. The descoping and shipment of submodules has opened up floor space, allowing fabrication of more submodules for the critical path component of CA-01. I'll discuss this a little more in detail later in my comments. The cost of moving fabrication activities to other vendors in an effort to relieve the burden on the facility are at the contractors' convenience, and as such, would be the responsibility of the consortium. Additionally, we have visited both Pegasus and NNI and feel confident in their nuclear safety culture of these facilities and that they meet industry expectations.", "I also wanted to give you a brief update on the on-hook dates for some of the structural modules. The on-hook date is when fabrication of an assembled module at our V.C. Summer site will be complete and it is ready to be placed on the hook of the heavy lift derrick. Module CA-20, seen on Slide 15, is an ancillary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. Here you can see a portion of this module on-site in the Module Assembly Building at the V.C. Summer facility. This module has on-hook date of Q1 of 2014. We recently agreed to receive certain CA-20 submodules from the Lake Charles facility that will allow minor rework and paperwork completion at the V.C. Summer site. This will free up additional space at the Lake Charles facility.", "Module CA-01 on Slide 16 is a steam generator and refueling canal module that will be located inside the containment vessel. On-site fabrication of this module for our project has not yet begun. But here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of CA-01 at one of the China sites. This module has an on-hook date of Q3 of 2014. Finally, module CA-03 on Slide 17. It's a Southwest wall module of the in-reactor water storage tank inside of the containment vessel. Fabrication of this module for our project has also not yet begun. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of a portion of this module at a similar AP1000 plant being lifted for placement. This module has on-hook date of Q4 of 2014. On Slide 18, you can see a summary that outlines the on-hook dates for these 3 modules.", "I would now like to direct your attention to the recent activities at the site on Slide 19. As I've mentioned previously, we completed an over-50-hour continuous pour of the nuclear island basemat, sometimes referred to as first nuclear concrete, for our first new unit, which can be seen in the picture at the top of the slide. The basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel shield building and auxiliary building that make up the nuclear island. At the beginning of April, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the Unit 2 basemat. You can see this module at the bottom left of the slide. This module had been previously assembled on-site and was lifted in place using the heavy lift derrick. CR-10 supports the containment vessel. As you can see at the bottom right, the containment vessel bottom head, which was also assembled on-site, was lifted into place by the heavy lift derrick in May. The containment vessel will house numerous reactor system components, such as reactor vessel, piping, steam generators and the pressurizer.", "On Slide 20, you can see pictures of the placement on the CA-04 reactor vessel cavity for Unit 2. This component was built on-site. In late September, this module was placed in the containment vessel bottom head. Its purpose is to house the reactor vessel, which we'll show you a picture of shortly.", "On the top of Slide 21, you can see a picture of the first containment vessel ring for Unit 2, which will be placed on the containment vessel bottom head. As pointed out in the photo, this section of rings contains penetrations for equipment and personnel access. At the top right of the same slide, you'll see a picture of Cooling Tower 2 Alpha. Cooling Tower 2 Alpha is structurally complete and is being fitted with electrical and mechanical components. All 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continued to progress as anticipated.", "At the bottom left, you will see a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. We have completed the placement of the dental concrete, the leveling concrete, the lower mudmat, the vapor barrier and the upper mudmat. The reinforcement barricades has been assembled and we plan to pour the first nuclear concrete for this unit this quarter. Again, this basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel, shield building and auxiliary building that make up the nuclear island for Unit 3. On the bottom right, you will see the Unit 2 Turbine Building. Placement of the Unit 2 Turbine Building basemat and associated walls has been completed.", "On Slide 22, you can see where the first of 3 lower condenser sections was set in the Unit 2 Turbine Building in July. This was the Bravo condenser. The Charlie condenser has also been set and the Alpha is scheduled to be set sometime soon. On Slide 23, you can see a schematic of how the various turbine building models will look when complete. The 5 modules that are highlighted in green have been placed in the final locations. That's CH-80, CH-81 Alpha, CH-81 Bravo and the previously discussed 2 lower condensers. Slide 24 shows the turbine building with the aforementioned modules in place. The Alpha condenser will be set between CH-81 Alpha and CH-80.", "On Slide 25, you'll see some components that have arrived on-site. On the top, you'll see a picture of the Unit 2 Reactor Vessel. The reactor vessel will sit inside of module CA-04, which has been placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel bottom head and will house the fuel assemblies. On the bottom right, you see the low-pressure turbine rotors, 2 Alpha and 2 Bravo as they arrive via railcar. There are 3 low-pressure and 1 high-pressure driven rotor for each of the new units. On the bottom left, you see 1 of 2 moisture separator reheaters being lifted with the heavy lift derrick.", "On Slide 26, you see the new nuclear CapEx over the life of construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018. It has been updated to reflect our estimates that will be in our Q3 2013 BLRA quarterly report. That report will be filed around November 8 of this year. As you can see, the next several years are considered the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related projected customer rate increases under the Base Load Review Act.", "Please now turn to Slide 27. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $67.2 million. The new rates were effective for builds rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2013 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And as you can see, in August, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2013. And as I mentioned, we intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2013 in November.", "On Slide 28, you will see a breakout of total nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see our estimate for the November 2013 BLRA project cost, which is down approximately $150 million from our August 2013 BLRA report and approximately $663 million from the original approval received from the South Carolina Public Service Commission. As you can see and as Jimmy mentioned earlier, this change is largely attributable to lower escalation.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I just wanted to kind of talk to you about sort of the longer-term growth rates here. You heard your colleague to the South talk about it yesterday. As you see beyond the current construction program, how do you think about your EPS growth rate in the 3% to 6% you've discussed?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, our range for a 3- to 5-year period. And that really takes us through -- I mean, we still have construction going on through that entire period. So we really don't -- haven't provided any outlook beyond that period, not prepared to today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ashar Khan of Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "So if I look at Slide 4, we are $2.67 basic EPS year-to-date. And if I'm right, last year, we earned around $0.78 in the fourth quarter in December. So if one assumes that we earn at a similar level, we come to like $3.45 for the whole year. So at the rate at the top of the guidance, is there something in the fourth quarter which is going to be abnormal or anything? I'm just trying to see why the guidance was -- why aren't you pointing towards the upper end of the guidance for the year? Or am I missing something which is there in the fourth quarter?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I'd say, Ashar, 2 primary reasons. Number one, we continue to watch this consumption issue that was highlighted over on Page 7, I believe it is. So we've got a little bit of a hedge built in for what we've seen in the last couple of quarters there, with lower consumption particularly in the residential, small commercial side. And then the second is in my comments there earlier, so year-to-date, we're basically flat year-over-year O&M. But we really project our year-over-year as of 12/31 to be more like 2% to 2.5% above last year. So we have some projects in the fossil hydro area that are going to occur in the fourth quarter that are O&M-related. We have health care cost trends that we know are going to impact us. We got in one of our property tax bills after we closed the books for September for one of our larger counties. So that's part of what we're contemplating in there as well. But I understand your comment. And if you ask me my bias today, it's on the upper end of the $3.35. I would have more of a bias towards being above that than below it. And frankly, most of the guys on the street are already there. I looked at it earlier today, and I think a half dozen or more are between $3.35 and $3.40 already.", "Ashar Khan", "And then to build upon that, Jimmy, 2014 as you show in your slides, the AFUDC is higher. The rate increase under the BLRA is higher. And now of course, the equity is going to come in at the end of the year, which was always forecast. But of course, now the amount is lower. And the debt requirements, you have also lowered. So does that not -- should one not assume that we should be again that the upper end of the growth rate has moved from '13 to '14?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, costs are changing, too. So we're in an economy now that has some inflation in it. So we are granting pay increases year-over-year now. We're hiring folks at the nuclear project, so we're bringing more folks online there. And I'd say the main thing, Ashar, though is continue just watching this consumption issue, what's going on in the base business. Even though our growth rates of number of customers is accelerating, folks are still concerned about the economy. And that's clear in our data as well as others. I saw just yesterday consumer confidence dropped over 15% from quarter-to-quarter. So I think until there's a clearer picture nationally that Washington has gotten their act together and that the economy is going to get on some solid footing, I think we're all wiser to be a little cautious.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to follow up a little bit on the demand stuff on Slide 7 that you're looking at. If I look at the top box and I see the customer growth and if I kind of look over the last couple of quarters, it may be averaging 1% or so. But then I look at the bottom box and we see, especially the residential, commercial down, I don't know, call it what, 1.5%. Does that mean that your actual per customer usage is going down, call it, 2% or something more than that, 1.5%? Wondering if I was reading that right and if you could clarify that.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, I think you're exactly right. I mean, that's what's going on the last couple of quarters. We have generally used 12-month numbers to present for this information. I got several requests last quarter from you guys to give separate quarterly data, so we've begun doing that. But there's a lot of volatility in quarterly data. I look back over the last 3 years and we've had 6 quarters where it's been up, 5 quarters where it's been down just over the last, I guess, 2 years and 3 quarters here. So there's a lot of volatility that happens in there. And some of those have been up as much as 10% and down as much as 5%. So it was just the economy, the volatility, the fits and starts of the economy. There's no clear direction at this point. The one thing I'd take away from this that is more consistent are the consistent 2-plus years of good, solid economic announcements we've had here with good solid jobs. And a lot of those announcements from 1 year or 18 months ago are turning into hard jobs now once the sites are built out, et cetera, from the tire industry, pharmaceuticals and others. And the industrial sales are moving in the right direction. And that ultimately translates into more confidence in the local economy and in the commercial area. I think the data I cited earlier around the Port of Charleston, their traffic is a good long-term indicator, too. But folks are still concerned. And I still think their biggest kind of reservation maybe the lack of coming to any conclusions in Washington.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then to follow up on that, kind of take the next step there, what's that long-term projection for demands that we should think about in that 3% to 6% earnings growth? And then tied to that, that 9.7% earned ROE, how much of that is demand? If we see, I presume if we were to see kind of continued 2% demand shrinking, that would have a big impact on the 3% to 6% earnings growth rate.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, it would affect if it continues for a long period of time. So here's what we see, and it's just our projection. But what we see is industrial demand continuing to grow. And in the short term, the next 18, 24 months, we continue to see pressure on particularly the residential segment as more of the efficiency standards move through the residential class, CFL lightbulbs, higher-efficiency HVAC systems, lower electric-consuming TVs, et cetera. That's already happened in the industrial sector and to a large sector in the commercial segment as well. But that is really what we see driving the short term in the residential segment. But in the long term, we really see kind of a net growth of slightly above 1% in the long-term demand. And that's what is really driving our generation expansion down the road.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I wanted to follow up on this a little bit because you're right, it is volatile from quarter-to-quarter. But it's so volatile it seems that the last 6 months, the 12-month number has gone from a positive 1.3% to now a negative number. And the components there above have also changed. And to sort of follow up on Travis' question here, you're -- it sounded to me like you're sort of projecting perhaps negative growth for the next 18 months. Is that right?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, we certainly see the residential segment having pressure on it just because of the efficiencies moving through. I mean, there aren't any more incandescent lightbulbs being manufactured. So they have to, as lightbulbs [indiscernible] drop off now, they've got to put CFL bulbs in. And they are more energy-efficient. So we see that in our projections over the next couple of years.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So when you mentioned the Washington impact or just the sort of economic uncertainty impact, would you say that's -- how would you compare that impact to this just sort of what we're seeing in terms of energy efficiency for appliances, lightbulbs, that kind of activity?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. Well, in our footprint, let's take before any of the new lighting standards moved through. Roughly 12% of our sales, residential sales, were driven by lighting. Once all of the current technology efficiencies move through the entire run, we see lighting making up about 6%. So the question is how fast has it moved through? And then what else is going on as far as conservation and just general uncertainty in the economy as it affects the residential customer? The price of gasoline, fluctuations, et cetera, what else causes the fits and starts in between? But we know somewhere at the end of this, there's going to be about a 6% change in the overall footprint, if you will, of the residential consumption related to lighting.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So we're at 12% now, is that correct?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Before the reduced consumption started.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "And when did happen?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "18 months, 24 months ago. I don't know precisely, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. I guess, I mean, I don't mean to put you on spot here. But I'm just wondering, do you know where we are right now, like in terms of where we are in the forecast on this? Because like you said, that's a huge decrease...", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I don't know on that specific item, no. And I don't know that it's -- that's a survey-type data. I don't know that -- it isn't like I don't have it at my fingertips. I don't know that we can get it. I don't know when every household has changed every bulb.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Yes, that would be a little bit intrusive.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So okay, fair enough. I mean, very interesting. Now in terms of the -- do you guys have any update or any information from your partners, Santee Cooper, in terms of what might happen with the disposition of their ownership?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, Paul, this is Steve. They're still interested in dispositioning their ownership. I think they're still interested in somewhere around the 10% share. As we understand it, they're still in discussions with Duke. And beyond that, I don't know that I can comment. You'd probably have to ask Santee Cooper.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Sure. Any timeframe or any concept as to when we might get a decision one way or the other?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "That's up to Santee and Duke. But we would welcome Duke as a partner.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Jimmy, Steve, real quick, just when thinking about the revisions to the nuclear capital spending schedule, big picture, relative to the last formal filing, where you outlined -- it's kind of a headwind or a tailwind, when you think about the impact on near term, let's say, 2014 or 2015 earnings power?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, I think it's -- if you think about -- if you're saying headwind in terms of lower BLRA increases, I think it is a headwind because there's lower cash flows forecasted in the next 2 to 3 years. And also the lower escalation, I mean, inflation continues to come down compared to what we originally projected, another $140 million lower in this recent data we just received last week. So that certainly would lower the expected increases and revenue increases related to that. But we don't necessarily view that as a negative. I mean, that's -- it really helps kind of flatten the impact on the customer. So we think that's a good thing in the long run.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "But should we be thinking of it is, it gives you lower CapEx partially offset by lower financing needs. So lower revenue increases partially offset by lower financing needs, but then also it implies lower AFUDC. Am I kind of thinking about the 3 buckets in the right way?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I think so. But the lower revenue and the lower financing costs, I mean, that's not a wash. Obviously, there's return built into the BLRA revenue for the equity side.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Understood. And talking about the demand, we've seen this with a couple of other Southeast utilities, where industrial demand is actually making a pretty positive uptick. Have you done any work around historically, near term and long, the lag between industrial recovery and trends in residential and small commercial, maybe separate trends, kind of how they correlate to industrial recovery and how maybe that trend has changed versus industrial? Meaning do you typically or historically see a real-time change in residential and small commercial when you're seeing a change in industrial? Or does resi and small commercial lag industrial recovery or precede it?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. Michael, I don't have anything objective to give you a kind of a 6-, 9-, 12-month answer. But I'll tell you, I do know that the residential customer generally lags going into a recession and kind of lags coming out because those jobs have to come up. They have to become employed. They have to dig out of their own personal holes they might have been in. And then they feel freer to have some discretionary income to spend and they're less focused on conservation, that kind of thing. But certainly, the dynamic is as you described it, but I can't tell you exactly the timing around it.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Last item, can you talk a little bit -- you gave a lot of great economic detail in terms of what's happening in your service territory. Can you talk a little bit about housing starts, what you're seeing locally, meaning in your sort of gas and electric service territories in terms of housing starts, kind of growth rates and occupancy rates?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. I don't have any of that objective data at my fingerprints. I've seen some recently. I just don't have it with me here, Michael. But it's fairly consistent with last year. And on the occupancy rates, particularly I was looking in a couple of our metro areas that we serve and the electricity footprint and the -- for example, office occupancy is down to some of its lowest levels since before the recession in Columbia and Charleston. So both of those markets are getting fairly, fairly low levels of available office space, too. But I don't have any of the exact numbers with me. We think that's public information. We can get it, and Christina can follow up with you later with it.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.", "Andrew Levi", "Hey, just a couple of questions. On O&M going forward, I know you haven't given a forecast for '14. But can just talk on a high level your ability to keep O&M growing slower or cut some costs relative to your lower residential sales expectations?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. I think there is still some more room there. I do think probably the pace that we've been on the last couple of years, particularly in retaining attrition, netting down lower headcount, I think the pace of that is going to have to slow. If you just look across the different regulated businesses we have, we probably got 10,000, 12,000 more customers than we had a year ago, and we're serving them with 100 fewer employees. You can't continue that long term and keep your focus on customer service, reliability and safety. But I think there's still some more opportunity there, particularly as technology and a variety of areas offers more efficiency. I'd say kind of getting at the heart of your question, I do see O&M for '14 likely higher. We'll be out with our official forecast in the year-end call. But I'd probably say it's going to be more like the year-end range we're expecting now of something around 2% or so.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. And just on the equity. So equity end of '14, it's $100 million of DRIP and $100 million of new equities. Is the way I read it?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Right. We originally had $275 million of additional equity in '14. And now with the shift in the project and the lower escalation, we see only needing about $100 million late in '14.", "Andrew Levi", "And then CWIP is, what, about $141 million lower. Is that correct?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, let's see here. CWIP is $141 million lower for the June 30, '14. For calendar '13 and '14 together, it's probably about the same number, ironically, for a different reason but about $140 million lower.", "Andrew Levi", "So I guess, if we kind of run through the numbers, the lower equity kind of almost offsets the CWIP over a 12-month period?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. And there's lots of other moving parts out, too, operating cash flows, et cetera. But yes, on a simplistic basis, that's true.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. And then last question I have, it just seems on the nuclear, just to make sure I understand kind of what Steve went through. So schedule-wise, you're still on, still very confident about your schedule that you've reset in June. CBI (sic) [CB&I] and situations at Lake Charles seems to be improving. And bottom line is you're actually spending less, not spending more than what you thought in June. Is that kind of a fair summary?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I think you captured it pretty well.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "You've covered most of what I was going to ask about. But just briefly, the new nuclear project cost coming down from the August BLRA to the November, did I hear you right that, that's almost entirely just lower escalation?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. And then lastly, the $200 million that's being negotiated. Just conceptually, I mean, the Office of Regulatory Staff made it pretty clear in their report that the modules were delivered with welding that didn't meet regulatory requirements. I'm just wondering why is this even a debate. It seems like it's pretty clear that from the outside that, that should be paid for by CBI, (sic) [CB&I] not you guys. But maybe you can explain some of the counterpoints to that. And then lastly, just touch on the timing. Do you still think that will be resolved by year end?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "The resolution, I'm not sure it would be resolved by year end. And it isn't as if I'm going to be given a change order to say, \"Here, you owe me $200 million more.\" This is an estimate that we put together, try to bound what the costs would be. And obviously, we believe that they will be less than that $200 million figure. That's all of our 55% piece representing SCE&G's ownership in the project. And while on the surface, I would agree with you that the issues coming out of the modules at Lake Charles should be the responsibility of the consortium, I've been at this long enough to know that the consortium may not see it that way. So we're just anticipating a fervent discussion with them. And we're hopeful of a positive outcome that will be fair to both sides.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, thank you. And just to summarize, we're pleased with our results through September and we remain on track to meet our internal target, as well as our guidance while continuing to focus on providing safe and reliable energy while also staying focused on executing the V.C. Summer construction project. We appreciate you joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded.

Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Operator", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, February 20, 2014. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron W. Hinson", "Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013. Joining us in the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory and regulatory activity. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.", "I would also like to mention again that we now post new nuclear project-related information directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA's Home page, there's a yellow box containing a link to the new nuclear section of the website that contains a link to project news and updates. It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time to time may be deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. In connection with this process, we have discontinued our prior practice of furnishing on Form 8-K the quarterly reports that SCE&G submits to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff for SCE&G's new nuclear projects. Instead, the company now posts copies of these reports in the new nuclear section of the SCANA website.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made today on the call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the company's Investor Relations section of the website.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Thanks, Byron. And thank you all for joining us today.", "I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2013 were $0.73 per share compared to $0.79 per share in the same quarter of 2012. Higher margins from base rate increases and customer growth were more than offset by expected increases in operation and maintenance expenses and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, property taxes and share dilution. You will also note in the footnote at the bottom of the slide that other income in Q4 of 2012 included the impact of some tower sales at our telecom subsidiary, as we do in the normal course of business from time to time. There were no such sales in 2013.", "Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the full year of 2013 were $3.40 versus $3.20 in 2012. Increases in electric margin due primarily to base rate increases and customer growth, as well as higher gas margins, were partially offset by increases in O&M and higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program. Results in the upper half of our guidance are consistent with our message on the Third Quarter Call in October.", "For the year, our O&M increased approximately 2.5% over 2012 principally due to specific rate-case-related expenses and the amortization of previously deferred items. The additional O&M increases that we had projected at the beginning of the year were largely mitigated by cost-control efforts such as lower labor cost due to attrition. These cost-control efforts, along with other items such as lower incentive comp accruals, resulted in relatively flat O&M growth year-over-year, except for the regulatory amortizations.", "Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's full year 2013 earnings were up $0.13 compared to 2012, driven largely by higher margins from an electric base rate increase as well as increases under the Base Load Review Act and the gas rate stabilization act, along with customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expenses, property taxes, interest and depreciation expenses and share dilution. For the fourth quarter, SCE&G's earnings were $0.03 lower than the same period last year due mainly to dilution.", "PSNC Energy's earnings for 2013 were $0.37 per share compared to $0.38 per share in 2012. Increased margins from customer growth were offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and dilution. Similar to the full year, the fourth quarter was down $0.01.", "The earnings for SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green, showed an increase of $0.09 over last year primarily due to a return to normal weather during the first quarter of 2013. For the quarter, SCANA Energy's earnings were $0.06, equal to the same period of last year.", "SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported flat earnings in the fourth quarter compared to a gain of $0.02 in 2012 related to the 2012 tower sales noted earlier. For the full year, these businesses reported basic earnings per share of $0.04 in 2013 compared to $0.05 in 2012.", "I would like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We continued to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. During 2013, companies announced plans to invest approximately $2.5 billion with expectations of creating approximately 10,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We're excited about the continued economic development in the region. At the bottom of the slide, you can see that the national unemployment rate, along with the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. While all these states continue to show marked improvement, the Carolinas are benefiting greatly from the industrial expansion. Specifically, South Carolina's jobless rate dropped below the national average for the first time since 2001. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.6%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.4%.", "Another positive data point on the economy is the recent United Van Lines' annual migration study. South Carolina and North Carolina ranked second and third, respectively, in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer growth. These are all very positive signs for our territories.", "Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric and gas growth rates for the year are 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. Our regulated gas businesses in North Carolina added customers at a 2.3% rate.", "The bottom table outlines our weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the quarter and the full year. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.9% for the fourth quarter and down 0.5% on a 12-month-ended basis. We are particularly encouraged by the industrial expansion, which has been mitigated by the efficiency and conservation into residential and commercial markets.", "Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.2 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.", "In the block on the top right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The 2013 earned return in the electric business is approximately 9.5%, well within our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. Control of O&M and non-new nuclear CapEx, while monitoring and responding to margin fluctuations, is essential to achieving this goal. We're very pleased with the execution of our strategy.", "Continuing down the page on our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. The South Carolina PSC approved our request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $570 million to our rate base and increased rates just under 2.9% in November. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to operate these businesses close to those returns.", "Along the bottom of the page is our regulatory schedule, exclusive of BLRA filings. These items are fairly routine annual filings.", "Slide 9 presents our updated CapEx forecast. The CapEx at new nuclear reflects Westinghouse and CB&I's projected cash flow estimates supporting the current in-service ranges for Units 2 and 3. The projected cash flow reflects changes made by the consortium and the timing of certain payments. These projected cash flow estimates do not include the estimated $200 million in-service delay cost. The previous cash flow estimates were SCANA's internal estimates with input from Westinghouse and CB&I.", "Forecasted CapEx in SCE&G, outside of the new nuclear deployment, increased slightly due to increased projected capital expenditures in our generation, transmission and distribution categories. Capital expenditures at remaining subsidiaries remain largely consistent.", "Along the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period, on which the BLRA increase is calculated.", "Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. The slide is consistent with the forecast from our last calls, other than the addition of 2018. To summarize our financing for 2013: We successfully settled our equity forward, resulting in the issuance of 6.6 million shares in early March and executed on-plan the equity financing through our 401(k) and reinvestment plans. SCE&G also issued $400 million in first mortgage bonds in June.", "The financing plan, CapEx plan and in-service dates for Unit 2 and 3 reflect the current assessment of our new nuclear construction project as well as other projects. Of course, the amounts and timing could change due to inflation, construction schedule or other factors.", "I would now like to discuss our 2014 weather-normalized earnings guidance and related assumptions, as shown on Slide 11. Our 2014 guidance is $3.45 to $3.65 per share, and our internal target is $3.55 per share. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in each of the first and third quarters, approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and the remainder in the second quarter. Additionally, we are resetting our base year to 2013 based on 2013 GAAP basic EPS of $3.40 per share. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA. This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier.", "Additionally, while we anticipate the number of customers will continue to increase, our assumption of customer average use of electricity is slightly lower next year to reflect current energy efficiency trends. We anticipate overall retail sales growth for 2014 to decline by approximately 0.2%. We forecast customer growth to be similar to 2013.", "We expect operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 3% higher in 2014 compared to 2013 actuals. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx-related costs of property taxes, depreciation and interest. Our effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 32%, and we estimate the rate for 2014 will be similar.", "Keeping in mind our internal target of $3.55, let's discuss potential upside and downside variables to our 2014 earnings range. There are several factors that could cause us to trend towards the lower end of our guidance. We continue to see fluctuations in average use. There continues to be industry uncertainty around electricity consumption, and as a result, we have forecasted average use to be slightly lower. Average use could come in lower than forecast due to higher efficiency adoption rates or simply conservation.", "Customer growth continues to be a bright spot in our service territory. We are currently forecasting an increase for 2014. However, if customer growth comes in lower than expected, this could negatively impact earnings. Additionally, if nuclear spending were to shift to later years, it would impact our earnings. In contrast, there are several factors that could push us towards the upper end of our guidance. If average use were to increase or come in better than in 2013 or customer growth accelerates beyond 2013 levels, we could have potential upside.", "Finally, as we reported last year, the pilot weather-normalization program in the electric sector ended as of December 2013, and we will see the impact of weather in our financials prospectively. Hopefully, this should provide you with a line of sight into our view of 2014 as you update your models.", "I also wanted to mention that, earlier today, we announced an increase to our annual dividend rate for 2014 to $2.10 per share, a 3.5% increase. The results of 2013 and confidence in the long-term strategy were key considerations. We are not -- now back within our stated payout policy of 55% to 60% and expect to grow dividends fairly consistent with earnings prospectively.", "Please turn to Slide 12. On January 27, we announced plans to increase our ownership in the V.C. Summer new nuclear units by 5% in the future. I will comment on a few financial matters related to this transaction, and Steve will comment later on the incremental capacity. As noted on the table, each incremented ownership interest will be funded with internal cash flow, driven largely by depreciation associated with the 2 new units. As a result, we do not expect to access the capital markets to fund this increase.", "This transaction will not occur until Unit 2 is complete, and therefore, no change in the base load review formulaic increases will occur. Additionally, the estimated $500 million purchase will add to SCE&G's rate base incrementally with each annual purchase. And we will work to develop a plan to mitigate and possibly eliminate any upward pressure on customers' rates due to this purchase in the future.", "In summary, we're very pleased with this transaction as it will add to base load generation for the long-term benefit of South Carolinians. We plan to file a petition with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina for approval of the transaction later this year.", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to further describe the impact of the transaction on our reserve margin and operations, as well as an update on our nuclear project.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy.", "I'd like to continue the discussion on the agreement with Santee Cooper. In looking at our future generation needs in the integrated resource plan, the company decided that purchasing additional nuclear power was a great fit to help us replace a portion of the older coal-fired plants we expect to retire over the next few years, and delay our need to build new gas-fired capacity after the year 2020.", "The structure of the 5% acquisition will happen in 3 stages. The first stage is triggered by the commercial operation date of the first new nuclear unit, which is currently anticipated to be late 2017 or the first quarter of 2018. At the time of commercial operation of the first new nuclear unit, we will acquire 1% or approximately 22 megawatts, with an additional 2% or 44 megawatts to be acquired no later than the first anniversary of the commercial operation date and the final 2% or 44 megawatts being acquired no later than the second anniversary of the commercial operation date. This approach keeps our reserve margins within our committed targets of 14% to 20%.", "Now I'd like to outline the impact of the additional 110 megawatts on our generation mix as we dispatch our plants. On Slide 13, you can see our generation mix by dispatch and capacity. This is then updated to reflect the effects of the additional 5% share of the new nuclear generation through 2020. This additional phased increment still maintains our balanced approach to capacity, keeping nuclear, coal and gas at roughly 1/3 each, with the remainder of our generation in hydro, biomass and solar. From an operational perspective, this non-emitting base load generation will fit nicely into our system and allow us to forestall the addition of peaking generators while satisfying Santee Cooper's needs to divest of some of their share.", "I'll now provide an update on our new nuclear construction project. Please turn to Slide 14. The company is reaffirming that we expect Unit 2's in-service date to be between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. This date is still within the Public Service Commission's 18-month schedule contingency window for the currently approved in-service date, which is March of 2017. In-service date for Unit 3 will be similarly delayed, or roughly 12 months after Unit 2. The company is also reaffirming the previously reported estimate of approximately $200 million of additional costs associated with this schedule change. While we continue our discussions with the consortium, we believe SCE&G's responsibility for any portion of the $200 million estimate should ultimately be limited to substantially less once all of the relevant factors are considered.", "I'll now provide a brief update to the on hook dates for some of our structural modules. As I previously mentioned, the on hook date is when fabrication of an assembled module at our V.C. Summer site will allow it to be placed on the hook of the heavy lift derrick. Module CA-20, see on Slide 15, is an auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. All CA-20 structural submodules have been received on-site and 2 of the 4 major subassemblies uprighted and set into place on the assembly platen in the Module Assembly Building, as well as parts of the third and fourth subassembly. The remaining few components of the subassemblies are being inspected, repaired on-site and are being prepared for installation on the platen. This module is scheduled for an on hook date of the fourth -- first quarter of 2014.", "Module CA-01, on Slide 16, is a steam generator and refueling canal module that will be located inside the containment vessel. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of CA-01 at one of the China sites. On-site fabrication of this module should begin soon. This module has an on hook date of the third quarter of 2014.", "Module CA-03, on Slide 17, is the southwest wall of the in-reactor water storage tank located inside the containment vessel. Fabrication of module CA-03 is progressing at Pegasus Steel's fab facilities in North Charleston, South Carolina. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of a portion of this module at a similar AP1000 plant being lifted for placement. This module has an on hook date of fourth quarter of 2014.", "The Unit 2 containment vessel Ring 2, shown on Slide 18, is the second ring of the containment vessel. This structure has an on hook date of the fourth quarter of 2014. The first ring of the Unit 2 containment vessel, which I will show you in a picture shortly, is scheduled to be placed during the second quarter of 2014.", "On Slide 19, you can see a summary that outlines the on hook dates for these 4 module structures.", "I would now like to discuss some recent activities at the site. Slide 20 presents an aerial view of the new nuclear site. In the center of the picture is the MAB or Module Assembly Building. To the right of the MAB, you can see Unit 2, and to left is Unit 3. Well, we are also making progress on the low-profile cooling towers along the bottom of the picture. I'll discuss the site in more detail shortly, but here, you can get a feel for the layout of the site, and you can see that things are really starting to take form.", "On Slide 21, you can see the picture of Unit 2 Nuclear Island. As previously mentioned, during 2013, we completed the over-50-hour continuous pour of the Nuclear Island basemat, also referred to as first nuclear concrete. Then using the heavy lift derrick, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the basemat, as well as the containment vessel bottom head on the CR-10 module. The containment vessel will house numerous reactor system components, such as the reactor vessel, tightening steam generators and pressurizer. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, work continues to form the concrete walls and other structures that comprise the Unit 2 Nuclear Island.", "On Slide 22, you can see a picture across the top of the slide showing the successful pouring of the Nuclear Island basemat for Unit 3, which took place in November. Again, this basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel, shield building and auxiliary building that make up the Nuclear Island for Unit 3. On the bottom left side of the slide, you can see the finished product of that pour. Currently, construction of the CR-10 module is taking place on the Unit 3 Nuclear Island basemat, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide.", "On the top left of Slide 23, you can see a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel bottom head. Similar to Unit 2, this bottom head will be placed on the Nuclear Island, on top of the CR-10 module for Unit 3. On the top right of the same slide, you'll see the first containment vessel ring for Unit 2. As I mentioned earlier, this ring should be placed on top of the Unit 2 containment vessel bottom head during the second quarter of this year. Two pictures along the bottom of the slide show cooling towers 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha. Both of these cooling towers are now structurally complete. All 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continue to progress as anticipated.", "On Slide 24, you can see the schematic of the turbine building that illustrates how the various turbine building modules will look when complete. The modules that are highlighted in green have been placed in their final locations, with work continuing to progress for modules CA-81 Charlie and CH-82.", "On Slide 25, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building. Comparing the schematic from the previous slide, you can see all of the previously mentioned modules in place on the turbine building basemat.", "On Slide 26, you will see a few of the components that have arrived on-site. On the top left, you'll see a picture of the Unit 2 reactor vessel. This vessel is a thick-metal-clad stainless steel and houses fuel assemblies. On the top right, you will see Units 2 and 3 accumulator tanks on-site. These accumulator tanks are safety-related tanks that hold water and would be used to inject that water into the reactor vessel if they were -- if there happen to be a loss of pressure effect.", "On the bottom left, you see 1 of 2 moisture separator reheaters being lifted with the heavy lift derrick. And moisture separator reheaters take steam coming out of the high-pressure turbine and super-heat that steam before it enters the low-pressure turbines to ensure that all -- that it's all steam and no water. On the bottom right, you will see the Unit 2 and Unit 3 core makeup tanks. Core makeup tanks contain boiled water and are a component of the passive cooling system that assists in safely shutting down the plant.", "On Slide 27, you will see the new nuclear CapEx over the life of the construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018 and has been updated using the fourth quarter of 2013 BLRA quarterly report, which we filed on February 11 of this month. As you can see, the next several years are considered the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related projected customer rate increases under the Base Load Review Act. As Jimmy stated earlier, the 5% future acquisition will not affect these projected BLRA increases.", "Please now turn to Slide 28. As we mentioned in our Third Quarter Call in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $67.2 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2014 are shown at the bottom of the slide.", "On Slide 29, you will see a breakout of total new nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see our current projected costs as filed in the fourth quarter 2013 BLRA quarterly report. Project costs are down approximately $633 million from the original approved -- approval received from the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. As you can see, this change is largely attributable to lower escalation.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Wondering at the SCE&G, you talk about the non-nuclear. What's the primary thing that's holding back that earned return from the allowed return, that 100 basis points or so?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, Travis, it is the kind of headwind of just general consumption, non-weather-related consumption, really what's going on across the industry, occurring with us too with more efficient lightbulbs, more efficient HVAC, et cetera. So that's the -- that's kind of the large headwind that we're working against and offsetting it with cost control.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Is there any point -- you've talked about customer growth, obviously, but demand growth slowing. Is there a point at which you see that demand growth stop slowing and perhaps start picking up again? Is there a trough point that you see in that region?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, it certainly does in the mid term. I don't have a point, a calendar point, to put on that now. But to draw you 2 points in time: In the short term here, we're expecting it about flat, slightly less than '14, 0.2% down, whereas in our longer-term IRP that's out there now, we're expecting something over 1% growth over a 15-year period. So I can't tell you exactly at what point that turns and in what year, but it -- we do see it turning in the long run.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Before we get run over on all the nuclear questions, a couple of questions on my end. Jimmy, would you mind explaining this interest rate derivative, the uncollected fuel issue in a little bit more detail and kind of walk us through the geography on the income statement in the fourth quarter of '13 so we can think about our models in the future a little bit more clearly?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I'll be glad to. So what happens there, if you want to kind of gross the income statement back up absent this accounting, you basically need to add $50 million back to margins and remove $50 million from other income. So we took these interest rate hedges that were substantially in the money and went to the regulator and said, \"Hey, core to our strategy over this next nuclear -- 3 nuclear peak construction years is not having any other increases to bear on customers' rates, like fuel.\" And we are substantially in the money on these hedges because interest rates have risen. And instead of the customer getting the benefit over the next 30 years in lower interest rates related to the bonds where we've amortized the hedges, we'll cash them in and take all of the benefit back to the customer now by offsetting under-collected fuel costs, avoiding a potential fuel increase. So the regulator agreed to that. And there's a net $50 million of that that netted down margins and increased other income.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay, super. On Georgia retail, I know you guys have had some significant cold weather down there. Can you talk about what you've been experiencing in the first quarter thus far, and how your contracts work down there? Are you guys variable or fixed?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "So our customers' contracts with us are both. And I would say a slight majority of them now are in the fixed area compared to variable, which is consistent with the entire market based upon our understanding of it. So more customers are in fixed contracts with marketers that are in variable contracts. We -- if they're in a fixed contract, we have a financial hedge in place based on any contracts entered into in any 1 month that aggregates all of those contracts and plans for normal weather. So when there's more -- abnormal weather, abnormally cold, of course, we've got some financial risk associated with that, but we're very comfortable. I'm not going to get into forecasting January's earnings, but we're very comfortable that January will be a good financial month for the Georgia business.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then let me kick off the nuclear stuff. Your friends are a few miles to the south. Are you thinking about doing a nuclear loan or at -- get a loan guarantee? Or at least, that's what every press is -- press report is telling us. How are you guys thinking about nuclear loan guarantees from the government?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, nothing's changed on our side. We continue to provide our information to the DOE on a periodic basis to keep them updated on our information since we initiated the application several years ago. And if ultimately we believe there is some benefit for the customer in that arrangement, we'll -- we would examine possibly doing it, but at this point, we've not seen the benefits.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.", "Andrew Levi", "Your guidance for this year, the $3.45 to $3.65, that's I guess based on kind of year end. Does it incorporate any weather in that pro-or-con?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's correct.", "Andrew Levi", "Like, whether it's upside or storms or anything like that.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Right. The only thing I would say is that in our operating forecast, on the electric business, we do have in our operating cost a $2.5 million of potential costs that is basically deductible, if you will, before we can use our storm damage reserve. And based upon the experience to date, I can assure you we've exceeded that amount. So I'm glad we had that in our forecast.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. So just explain that, I guess, real quick. So you have this $2.5 million deductible, which is in your forecast, but any incremental storm cost in South Carolina is covered through a clause or through insurance vote?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, so we have a storm damage reserve that we ceased adding to effective with the new base rates in the beginning of '13. But it has about $25 million in it at this point. So anything related to storms above the $2.5 million annually would go against that reserve. If we were to exceed the amount in the fund at this point, then we would simply defer that and go back to the regulator. Our agreement is, through the last settlement, we would go for some type of mechanism to get that recovered.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. And then I think, clearly, there's upside from the weather as far as temperatures and things like that, but then also I guess you had some outages as well. But net-net, would you think you're on the plus side there weather-wise?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. We did have outages. We had at the peak probably 140,000 customers out. That did not last very long, probably less than 1 day. We had them all back on within about 5 days or so. But we made a rough estimate of the actual revenue loss, and that's less than $1 million.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. So net-net, weather should be a positive, and that's not incorporated in your guidance for 2014...", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, financially, it's a positive. It's a heck of a way to get there with all that the states have been through in last week, though.", "Andrew Levi", "Right. No, no, I get that. It's not good for the customers at all. And then just on the Georgia side, how should we kind of think about that just at a very high level? I just remember, when we had the warm winter, there was a financial hit. Now we've had a really cold winter. So how should we kind of think about that business relative to what's the norm? Because your earnings are fairly consistent there.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, what I would say is January is 1 of about 5 important months for the Georgia business. We're in the middle of February now. It's 82 degrees today. So we're not selling a lot of gas in Atlanta and the surrounding areas. So we -- I think we'll have a very good month in January, my gut feel. February, with part of it cold in the early part of the month, and now it's in the 80s, we'll have to wait and see what the rest of the month brings. But there are really 5: January, February, March, November, December all are key to that business. So we're only 20% of the way through the real earnings season for 2014 for Georgia.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Mike Weinstein [ph] of UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "It's Julien here, actually. Could you elaborate a little bit on the service delay costs, what the latest is there? And perhaps to the extent of which timing, do have any sense as to when this all might come to a head, if you will?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "You're talking about new nuclear?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, on the new nuclear, the $200 million.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "$200 million? Yes, I think what you heard us say today was that we're reaffirming that we still think that value is good and that that's still our number, not a consortium number. But we are anticipating that the consortium is going to go through another estimate at completion through this spring and summer. And sometime perhaps third quarter- or fourth quarter-ish of this year, I would anticipate that they will give us an estimate that will include anything that they see from that delay from receiving the modules, and that will start our negotiations at that point.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And how long would that take just so you could kind of continue running out the...", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, I'd be -- I'm loathe to give you a time estimate. Our experience with negotiating with the consortium is that things take a long time but it's worthwhile in the end. And then we've got an almost completely new management team in at CB&I and a lot of new folks at Westinghouse since the last time we went through one of these kind of negotiations, which would have been with their predecessor, Shaw. So it will take a while. Now whether that's a quarter, 2 quarters, 3 quarters, I don't know what I could tell you that.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Right. And could you just elaborate a little bit more on the shift? It looks like some of the CapEx that you were intending to spend in '13 moved out to '14 and '15. Could you just talk a little bit more about that?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, I think what we're looking at now is that, at our last quarterly call, we were estimating spending about $897 million in '14. We're now looking at some of the money from '13 moving into '14, so that's now increased by about $53 million in '14. Then that's largely a compression of the schedule. So when the end date stays the same and they don't spend as much in '13, it's going to push into '14 and '15. So the '14 number looks like about an additional $53 million. So when the consortium doesn't hit milestones, and they get paid based on milestones, we withhold payment.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got you, excellent. And then lastly, could you just comment quickly? You comment briefly in your remarks about the additional 100 or so megawatts. Is that it in sort of for the time being in terms of ultimate ownership? If you could talk maybe about a long term? Is there a desire for more, or how this negotiation ultimately happened in your mind in terms of desire to take down more of the plant?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "You know what, it's the -- our desire really was based on the desire of our partner, Santee Cooper, to divest of some of their ownership percentage. I think their appetite to sell off some of their piece has diminished over the last couple of years. At one point in time, I think they were talking about a much higher percentage. And it looks like the 5% that we're going to take is satisfying their desire to divest of some of their ownership percentage. So I don't foresee that changing. I think that the 5% that we've agreed to purchase, pending the regulatory approvals, at least at this point in time, is it.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then from a seasonal perspective, the approvals, how long is that they're going to take here? I mean, how does that mesh into everything, if you will? Is there any kind of key date we should be bearing in mind there?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "No, nothing key. The really -- the ball is in the court of us to pull that together and go to the ORS and ultimately to the commission. And we would expect to do that sometime later this year, but there's no key requirement or time frame around it.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of just nuts-and-bolts item, and then one for Steve on the nuclear project. Jimmy, just real quick, on the gas RSA, what are you kind of expecting about -- for that in terms of potential rate revenue changes at the back end of the year?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, well, as we have on one of our slides there, the business has earned -- at this point, we're earning up in the 10.6%, 10.7% range, something like that. So that's in the upper end of the 50 basis point band. And the real contributor to that is the cost-control efforts we've had across the enterprise. And so -- and as well as really good growth in the gas system. So those new customers using more gas, with the growth, has really helped keep that return up. To me, it's really a kind of a high-class problem to have. We're likely in the situation where we'll not have an RSA increase this fall, but that's because we're earning the returns and we're controlling cost increases. And therefore, the -- we're running the business at the allowed return. So I really don't see a lot changing in that RSA.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And so you -- basically, you don't assume there's a gas rate increase at SCE&G. And it doesn't strike me there's a general rate case process or much happening on the PSC -- PSNC side. Am I thinking about both of the gas businesses kind of correctly there from a revenue requirement change?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I would certainly say that's the case for the next 12 months.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then O&M, I want to make sure I understood. You made a comment about expect O&M roughly up 3% year-over-year. Just curious what's driving that. You all have a pretty good history of, I want to say, giving an initial O&M level and then coming in and beating it, and give credit to you guys for doing that. But just kind of curious what's driving -- given we're in a low inflationary environment right now, what's kind of driving that change in the year-over-year O&M?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I think it's -- if you look at our actual results, they've been basically flat in the last couple of years now, realizing on the face of the financials that '13's actuals are up about 2.5%. But I said in the earlier comments, all of that was really driven off rate case amortization. So despite wage increases, increases from contractors, et cetera, we were able to hold our real costs flat other than those amortizations that flow through. You can only do that so long. If you look across all of our customer base, over the last couple of years, we've added about 30,000 customers in all 3 states combined. We're serving them with 200 fewer employees today outside of the folks that Steve's hiring in new nuclear. So we've done a really good job of holding that back for a while. We got to make sure in the longer run that we balance that against and don't cause damage to the customer service, reliability or safety, and we're just looking at balancing that.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And now that you don't have weather normalization now at SCE&G on the electric side, you still have it on the gas side. And is it on the gas side for both businesses, or just the SCE&G side?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, it's on both gas LDCs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then, Steve, on -- in the BLRA filing, there was a little bit of discussion about issues or concerns, really more issues with the reactor coolant pump and piping. And can you just kind of rehash for us, what actually is a reactor coolant pump and the piping that goes in it? And what are the some of the issues or concerns that you touched on in the BLRA?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Sure. The way the reactor coolant system works is that the fuel rods are there really to make heat, and then the reactor coolant system water will move that heat and it carries it to a steam generator where we make steam with a secondary source of water. So our water never boils, it stays liquid, and we will then pump it right back from the steam generator to the reactor vessel. So it just makes a big loop. And on the bottom of the steam generators, in order to pump it back to the reactor vessel, we have 2 reactor coolant pumps. And these are new to the commercial nuclear industry type pumps. So they've been used for decades in military applications, like the Navy. So these are big canned rotor pumps. When they get the bugs worked out, I think they're going to be much, much better than the previous version of reactor coolant pumps, but they are working through some of those bugs. So there's a lot of testing that's going on, particularly for the projects in China. And as they're going through those China checkouts or tests, they're finding some issues...", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And can you -- and what kind of -- when you say issues, I mean, are we talking operational issues? Or are we talking kind of the stuff like getting the materials delivered to your site on-time and on-schedule?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "No, no. We're talking about operational issues found during the test. We don't have any issues that we're aware of with the supply chain or getting them delivered to the site. But they've had some issues with some bearings that have been overheating. That's going to entail bearing redesigns and those kind of things. Not overly concerned about those. The do have one issue with some parts of the in-power [ph], which is the motor force on this pump that drives the water. Some repairs were made to some of those for the China project that created loose parts. And we've discovered that we did not go through the same process, so we shouldn't expect the same kinds of loose parts. So there's kind of checkout issues on the reactor coolant pumps. And I believe that the pressure being exerted on the supplier by the Chinese will solve the problems for us.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "I wanted to elaborate. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on Julien's question about the timing of the nuclear CapEx. I understand that some of the dollars that you expected to pay in '13 spilled into '14. But if I look at the BLRA from last week, it looks like there was also a pretty big pickup in '15 as well as '16, and then reductions in the outer years. So am I right in reading that, that the spending almost got compressed even further into the peak years?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. So here is the situation: If you -- let's look at it on the a mid-year basis since that's the way the BLRA filings happen, based on the CWIP that's expended through mid year. So what we forecast is that the -- that through midyear-2014, we'll be down $164 million compared to what we had earlier expected, and we will pick that up in '15, '16 and '17. So it's just kind of a skewing to the right of the same dollars. There's no real change in the dollars overall related to this. But the $164 million lower in '14, add 96 in '15, 43 in '16, 45 in '17 and about $18 million less in 2018. So it's just a change of the distribution.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. And then one other question. This is just sort of a -- maybe I'm misreading something in the press releases, but when I -- every quarter, you detail how many customers you have for the electric and gas utilities. And the numbers I'm calculating are very different from what you're reporting. So when I compare this press release versus the one a year ago, I'm showing about 0.66% increase in the customer count versus you're reporting a number significantly higher. You're basically showing almost 2% on an average basis. Is there anything that would cause the year-ago numbers to somehow be restated? Was there any reclassification?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, there's no reclassification, there's no restatement or anything of that nature. So it should be period-end data compared to the period end a year ago. So we've got -- I'm looking at it here now. We have 675,000 electric, 325,000 gas in South Carolina and just over 500,000 gas in North Carolina. And that yields 1.2%, 2.1% and 2.3%, respectively.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay, maybe I'll follow up offline, but I just want to clarify the -- when you talk about similar growth in '14 that you saw in '13 on the customer counts, you are talking about those numbers that you just described, right, like the almost 2% on average?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's exactly right.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Addison for his closing remarks.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, thank you.", "And to summarize, we're pleased with our results for 2013 and are optimistic about 2014.", "And finally, I'd like to mention a couple of opportunities to meet with you in person. Steve and I will be on the road the first week of March in New York and Boston at investor conferences, and we hope to see many of you there. And also, our upcoming Analyst Day event is going to be held in New York on June 5, and we would encourage you to mark your calendars as -- with a placeholder for that and plan to attend.", "We thank you for joining us today and appreciate your interest in SCANA.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 24, 2014. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Byron W. Hinson", "Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2014.", "Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer for SCE&G.", "During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory and regulatory activity. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to on this call are available at scana.com.", "Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project directly on our website at scana.com. On SCANA's home page, there's a yellow box containing a link to the new nuclear section of the website that contains a link to project news and updates. It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time to time may be deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. In connection with this process, we have discontinued our prior practice of furnishing our Form 8-K, the quarterly reports that SCE&G submits to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff for SCE&G's new nuclear project. Instead, the company now posts copies of these reports on the SCANA website.", "In addition, I want to remind you that you can sign up under the Investor Relations section of scana.com for email alerts for financial press releases and operational announcements. You can now sign up for email alerts when there is a posting on the new nuclear yellow box.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Thanks, Byron, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the first quarter of 2014 were $1.37 per share compared to $1.13 per share in the same quarter of 2013. Our earnings in the first quarter are reflective of ending the electric weather normalization pilot in December 2013, as mentioned on the year-end call. The company's financials will now be impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business. Accordingly, the improved results in the first quarter are attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to the abnormally cold winter weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth along with higher gas margins. These higher margins were partially offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, property taxes and share dilution.", "Now on Slide 4, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's first quarter 2014 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.21 compared to 2013, driven largely by higher electric margins due primarily to a benefit of $0.10 of abnormal weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as higher gas margins. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses, as well as expenses related to our capital program, including the property taxes, depreciation and share dilution.", "PSNC's earnings for the first quarter of 2014, shown in red, were $0.24 per share, consistent with the first quarter of 2013. Increased margins from customer growth were offset by higher depreciation and share dilution.", "SCANA Energy, our retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green, reported first quarter 2014 earnings of $0.16 per share, consistent with our first quarter of 2013. A benefit of $0.05 of incremental volume, due to abnormally cold weather during the quarter, was offset by higher commodity prices experienced in serving the incremental volumes and price competition.", "SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $0.05 per share in the prior year.", "I would like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 5. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far, in 2014, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $160 million with expectations of creating approximately 1,200 jobs in our Carolinas territories.", "At the bottom of the slide, you can see that the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for our 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. While all these states continue to show marked improvement, the Carolinas are benefiting greatly from the industrial expansion. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.6%.", "Slide 6 is an interesting slide I came across recently related to the real estate investment community. Based on their projections, over the next 20 years, 43% of the U.S. population growth will be concentrated in 10 strategic growth corridors. As you can see in the illustration, a couple of those main corridors run through the Carolinas and Georgia, passing through the geographic footprint of all of our major subsidiaries.", "Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric and gas growth rates for the 12 months ended March 31 are 1.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina added customers at a 2.3% rate.", "The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the quarter and 12 months ended March 31, 2014. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 3.6% for the first quarter and 0.5% on a 12-month-ended basis.", "Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.3 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.", "In the block on the top right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2014, in the electric business is approximately 10.2%, well within our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We're very pleased with the execution of our strategy.", "Continuing down the page on our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. In November of last year, the South Carolina PSC approved our request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $570 million to our rate base and increased rates just under 2.9%. As Steve will discuss shortly, we will be filing our new request for revised rates in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to operate these businesses close to those returns.", "Along the bottom of the page is our regulatory schedule, exclusive of BLRA filings. These items are fairly routine annual filings.", "Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. The CapEx at new nuclear reflects Westinghouse and CB&I's projected cash flow estimates, as adjusted by the company, supporting the current in-service ranges for Units 2 and 3. These estimates provide a preliminary high-level estimate of the cash flows. At the bottom is our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.", "Slide 10 presents the estimated net change to the cash flows and incremental new nuclear CWIP. The incremental new nuclear CWIP is lower in 2014 than our previous estimate, driven by the delay in achieving certain construction milestones during the 12-month period. An example of the milestone delay is CA-20, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes.", "Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This slide is consistent with the forecast from our last call.", "Now on Slide 12. We're reaffirming our earnings guidance at $3.45 to $3.65 per basic earnings per share, along with our internal target of $3.55 per share. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3- to 5-year period.", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to Slide 13. As we have stated before, the company's current construction schedule indicates the in-service range for Unit 2 is between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. This date is still within the Public Service Commission's 18-month scheduled contingency. The in-service date for Unit 3 will be roughly 12 months after Unit 2.", "As the company noted in its last BLRA filing, the consortium is currently re-baselining the Unit 2 and Unit 3 consortium schedules to incorporate a more detailed evaluation of the engineering and procurement activities and to provide a detailed reassessment of the impact of the revised Units 2 and 3 schedules on engineering and design resource allocations, procurement schedules, construction work efficiencies and other items. Although we do not yet have a re-baselined schedule, we believe, based on discussions with the consortium, that the in-service dates for the new units will be within the 18-month PSC-allowed construction contingency.", "I'll now provide a brief update to the on-hook dates for some of the structural modules. As I previously mentioned, the on-hook date is when fabrication of an assembled module at our V.C. Summer site will allow it to be placed on the hook of the Heavy Lift Derrick.", "Module CA-20, seen on Slide 14, is an auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. Finishing touches are taking place on this module inside of the Module Assembly Building and it is scheduled for on-hook date in May. This on-hook date was amended from Q1 2014 to May of 2014 earlier this month due to inclement weather from 2 ice storms, which closed the site for approximately 1 week; Chicago Bridge and Iron performance and production-related delays in the aligning and welding of submodules; and the incorporation of lessons learned from setting the same module at the Vogtle site a few weeks earlier.", "Module CA-01, on Slide 15, is the steam generator and refueling canal module that will be located inside the containment vessel. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of CA-01 at one of China sites. We're amending our anticipated on-hook date for this module from Q3 of 2014 to Q3 -- or Q4 2014. As with CA-20, we have modified the date to take this into account -- or to take into account the lost time due to the CB&I self-imposed stop work order at their Lake Charles facility that has now been lifted and CB&I performance and production-related experience. Submodules for CA-01 have started to arrive, and on-site fabrication on this module should begin shortly.", "Module CA-03, on Slide 16, it's the southwest wall of the in-reactor water storage tank, located inside the containment vessel. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of a portion of this module at a similar AP1000 plant being lifted for placement. The consortium have moved fabrication of this module to a facility in Florida from a facility in North Charleston, South Carolina. This module has an anticipated on-hook date of Q4 2014.", "Unit 2 containment vessel Ring 2, shown on Slide 17, is the second ring of the containment vessel. This structure has a scheduled on-hook date of Q4 2014. The first ring of Unit 2 containment vessel, which I'll show you a picture of shortly, is scheduled to be placed during the second quarter of 2014.", "On Slide 18, you can see a summary that outlines the on-hook dates for these 4 modules, as well as their current status. I'd now like to discuss some of the recent activities at the site.", "Slide 19 presents an aerial view of the new nuclear site. In the center of the picture is the MAB or Module Assembly Building. Below the MAB, you can see Unit 2 and to the right is Unit 3, as well as the Heavy Lift Derrick.", "We are making progress on low-profile cooling towers that you can see on the left side of this picture. I'll discuss the site in more detail shortly. But here, you can get a feel for the layout of the site, and you can see that things are really starting to take shape.", "On Slide 20, you see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. As previously mentioned, during 2013, we completed the over 50-hour continuous pour of the nuclear island basemat, also referred to as first nuclear concrete. Then using the Heavy Lift Derrick, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the basemat, as well as the containment vessel bottom head on the CR-10 module. 2 of the 3 courses of concrete that will allow setting of the first ring section have been placed below the bottom head and around CR-10. The containment vessel will house numerous reactor system components, such as the reactor vessel, piping, steam generators and the pressurizer. As you can see on the slide, work continues on the Unit 2 nuclear island with the walls taking shape, as well as components being placed in the auxiliary building and inside the containment vessel.", "On Slide 21, along the top, you can see pictures showing the successful pouring of nuclear island basemat for Unit 3, which took place in November. This continuous pour took only 43 hours due to lessons learned on the Unit 2 pour. On the bottom left of the slide, you can see the finished product of that pour. Again, this basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel, shield building and auxiliary building that make up the nuclear island for Unit 3. Construction of the CR-10 module on the Unit 3 nuclear island basemat that you can see on the bottom right of the slide is now complete.", "On the top left of Slide 22, you can see a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel bottom head. Similar to Unit 2, this bottom head will be placed on the nuclear island on top of the CR-10 module for Unit 3. On the top right of the same slide, you'll see some of the containment vessel rings. On the front left, you can see the beginnings of the first ring for Unit 3. Behind it, on the back left, you can see the second ring for Unit 2, which, as mentioned earlier, is scheduled to be on the hook in fourth quarter of 2014. On the back right, you can see the first ring for Unit 2.", "On the bottom left, you can see cooling tower 2 Alpha and the Unit 2 circulating water pump house excavation. As mentioned during our last call, both cooling towers 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha are now structurally complete. All 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continue to progress as anticipated. The circulating water system pump house is used to move water from the cooling towers back to the condenser in the plant.", "On the bottom right, you'll see a picture from inside the new water treatment facility. This facility will provide the site with potable water and filtered water.", "On Slide 23, you can see a schematic of the turbine building. It illustrates how the various turbine building modules will look when completed. The modules that are highlighted in green have been placed in their final locations, with work continuing to progress for modules CH-82 and CH-81 Charlie.", "On Slide 24, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building. Comparing the schematic from the previous slide, you can see all of the previously mentioned modules placed on the turbine building basemat, as well as the progress being made on CH-82.", "On Slide 25, you will see a few of the components that have arrived on-site. On the top left, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 reactor vessel. This vessel is a thick metal clad with stainless steel and houses the fuel assemblies. On the top right, you'll see the Unit 2 auxiliary transformer. This transformer provides power for the Unit 2 station loads. On the bottom left, you'll see 1 of 2 moisture separator reheaters being lifted with the Heavy Lift Derrick. The moisture separator reheater takes steam coming out of the high-pressure turbine and superheats the steam before it enters the low-pressure turbines to ensure that it's all steam and no water. On the bottom right, you'll see the Unit 2 diesel generators. These generators are non-safety-related components that provide backup power for Unit 2.", "On Slide 26, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx over the life of the construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018 and reflects our preliminary estimates that are expected to be updated and filed in the first quarter BLRA filing in mid-May.", "As you can see, the next several years are considered the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related projected customer rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and are associated with the right-hand axis. As we stated during our last call, the incremental 5% future acquisition of the new nuclear project from Santee Cooper will not affect these projected BLRA increases.", "Please now turn to Slide 27. We have 2 BLRA filings coming up in May. As mentioned earlier, in mid-May, we file our quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And on May 30, we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. Both of these filings will be made available for review in the new nuclear development yellow box in the Investor Relations section at scana.com.", "On Slide 28, you'll see a breakout of the total new nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see our preliminary estimate of project costs as of the first quarter of 2014. Project costs are down approximately $623 million from the original approval received from the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. As you can see, this change is largely attributable to lower escalation.", "On Slide 29, you'll see a picture of Unit 1 at V.C. Summer station. On April 4, we took Unit 1 offline to begin a scheduled refueling outage. The outages occur at 18-month frequencies, and this is the 21st for V.C. Summer Unit 1, which began commercial operation in 1984. The refueling outage allows us to replace about 1/3 of V.C. Summer's 157 fuel assemblies, perform preventive maintenance work and make preemptive inspections and repairs. During this outage, we performed a planned inspection of the reactor vessel head. The reactor vessel head contains a total of 66 penetrations, which are mostly used to maneuver control rods in the reactor. As a result of this inspection, we identified wells for a few of these penetrations that need repair. An extensive robotic inspection of the vessel showed that there was no leakage from these areas as a result of the condition of the wells. This kind of maintenance is common over the life of the nuclear plant, and the work can be done in parallel with other preplanned plant improvements, so that there will be a minimum impact to the outage.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Before we get into all the nuclear questions, maybe you could help me out with just some basic blocking- and tackling-type questions. It's really one question with 2 parts. So your '14 EPS guidance range was affirmed at the $3.45 to $3.65. But if I look at the trailing 12 months, you're at $3.65. Now I know you have BLRA revenues coming in, in '14. So how -- what keeps you within that stated range for '14? That's the first part of the question. The second part is, which I think is actually more important is, with your growth rate also being maintained at the 3% to 6%, and my numbers for '14 are obviously coming up, how should I think about comps going forward? So saying it differently, how will you -- or will you hit the 3% to 6% growth rate in 2015 off of a 2014 base, especially if that '14 base is above the original guidance range?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, Jim. So the first part, I would say -- again, as I said in the earlier comments, our prepared comments, $0.10 of Q1 was weather from the electric business. So that's the first time in 3 years we've had a weather impact in the electric business because we had to pilot weather normalization. So does that $0.10 sustain itself through the end of the calendar/fiscal year? Who knows? It was a cold first quarter, but frankly, it was about the same as Q1 of '13. It's just that we had the normalization in for the electric business in '13. So it took a quarter to generate that much excess weather in a very unusual winter. To give you an example, we had 17 days in March where the lows were in the 30s. Now I know I'm not going to get the sympathy from you in New York with those kind of temperatures, but that is very unusual in the southeast with that kind of weather. Whereas it took a quarter to generate that excess here, we could easily, if we had a mild July or August, all of that could erode. So it's a little early to start saying, \"is that going to put you over the top end?\" And as far the longer term, as you said, the more important question, we're still comfortable with that 3% to 6% for '14 based on the '13 base.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of UBS.", "Michael Weinstein", "Could you talk a little bit more about the nonregulated gas company and the $0.05 offset in each direction and how that was been affected by the polar vortex?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. So in that market, SCANA and the broader market, a majority of the customers now are on fixed rates. And of course, we -- financially, we don't speculate on that. So we financially hedge those customers for the term of their contract based on normal weather. So when we have colder-than-normal weather, we've got to either provide that additional gas, if you will, from a financial standpoint from the spot market or from storage. And there is only so much you can do out of storage when you have that extreme weather. So when we bought the additional gas to serve those customers, that eliminated a great deal of the benefit from the actual additional sales.", "Michael Weinstein", "What drove the additional sales? Was that...", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Weather, all weather.", "Michael Weinstein", "Okay. Okay. So normally -- all right, if you didn't have...", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. Sorry, I missed the first part of your question.", "Michael Weinstein", "So essentially, even though you're hedged or even though you got caught -- basically, I mean, like everybody else got caught short with fixed contracts in an extreme weather situation, it still wound up being a neutral effect.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. That's right, and we've had that situation before. And I would say, that's a -- I'm sure it could be slightly less, but I can't imagine it being a lot more extreme than that. So in -- on a real live, very extreme case, we're still on our plan for the year. So compared to 2013's first quarter, which was a normal weather quarter overall, where this one was abnormally cold, we ended up about the same point.", "Michael Weinstein", "Right. I guess, the thing that confuses me a little bit is that if -- more of a bad thing should be just bad, right? I mean, in other words, increased sales that are money-losing sales because they're unhedged should have just been negative.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, that's only part of our customer base, right? So we got -- and we, SCANA Energy, as well as the whole market has another segment of the customers that are variable-price customers, that are repriced each month, so...", "Michael Weinstein", "Oh, that explains it. Okay.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Right, right.", "Michael Weinstein", "Okay. All right. Got you. So the variable is positive, fixed is negative?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right.", "Michael Weinstein", "That's the story. Okay. And also, on the nuclear part, just to ask one question there. Just seeing that the overall CapEx level is down negative and, I guess, about $32 million less. And is the reason for that just lower financing costs going forward because of the delay?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Right. So that's $32 million less just in those first 3 years that are presented. If you look down on the recap box at the -- in the top half, we just tie it to the 3-year 10-K disclosures. So at the bottom, though, you'll see the full project disclosure. And you'll see it's actually slightly a net increase over that period because some of those milestone payments we'll be making later and, therefore, they incur a little more escalation. So you're only catching part of the picture with those first 3 years.", "Michael Weinstein", "I see. And that's why escalation is about $10 million less or there's a -- yes, like -- $10 million less under budget than before, right?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering, during some of these extreme cold weather events you had, maybe in hours or days, if you saw certain stresses in your system, either on the gas or the power side and how that might play into your thoughts about investment going forward.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Travis, this is Steve. We did see some stresses on our generating system. I think it was January 7, we had -- which was unusual for us, we set a 24-hour energy peak. Generally, we're a summer-peaking utility. But it got cold enough down here that we actually set a peak, an all-time peak for 24 hours in the wintertime. So January 7 was a stressor for us, a stressor for a couple reasons. One, we had a couple of generating plants that were out. Given the high loads, all of our neighbors were also stressed, so the power available on the open market wasn't there. And then, of course, there were operational flow orders that would limit the gas that you could take to power plants coming out of the Gulf. And so we had both gas and electric supply issues during some of that cold weather. The second cold weather events, we didn't have any problems.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. More of macro kind of on that idea, would north to south pipeline flows, in terms of the gas side, would that have done anything? Would that have alleviated any problems, i.e., is there -- do you guys see value in reversing, essentially, some of those flows?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes. From our perspective, as long as I could lock down more supply on the pipeline, then it would likely help me. But there wasn't anything to be had on the pipeline, as in the capacity of the pipeline was maxed out. So we were limited to what we had reserved on frontal [ph] capacity during those time frames. So what I would need is, it's not just the supply; it's the capacity.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to check in on coal ash, and it's just been an issue that we think a lot about. Is there any movement in the state as you think about the potential treatment of storage facilities, et cetera? Is that something that's coming up?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Well, what we've seen as a result of the Kingston Dam failure back in 2008 and then more recently, the Dan River failure, we have seen an increased interest in state regulators on any impoundments we would have, i.e. ash ponds. Now we -- because of facility retirements, we're down to only 2 locations that have ash ponds, and we have active plans to retire those. So for us, I think it's a pretty good news story. And we're actually ahead of schedule on emptying out some of the ash from those ponds. So where we can, we're sending it to beneficial reuse. So it's things like the cement industry, wallboard industry, those kinds of things. So while we've seen increased scrutiny, our plans have stood up to that test.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. Than just over on the solar side of things, I was just curious, the latest in terms of proposed solar legislation, how is that going? What's been the sort of range of reaction and what should we be looking for there?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "We have worked with other stakeholders in the state, including environmental groups and the other utilities to propose some legislation. We believe the legislation is a good way to enact solar that tries to learn some of the lessons from places, particularly on the West Coast, in Arizona, that have implemented without a good set of ground rules and have run into some problems. That legislation is not yet out of the legislature in South Carolina. If successful, we believe it will be a model for the industry. That said, we do have active plans to build solar. We're looking at a couple of utility-scale solar farms now, in addition to what we already have in our system, which is over 200 solar generators, the largest of which is on the roof of the Boeing facility down in Charleston.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "Jimmy, can you -- I was looking through -- I'm sorry, I don't have this. When you came up with guidance earlier than the first quarter, what growth rate did you assume as part of the midpoint?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, the growth for the $3.55?", "Ashar Khan", "That's correct.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I think that off of actual '13, it was like 4.2%, something like that.", "Ashar Khan", "So you expect it...", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Low 4s.", "Ashar Khan", "Sorry?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Low 4%, yes.", "Ashar Khan", "Low 4% growth rate in sales?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Oh, I'm sorry. I was talking about earnings.", "Ashar Khan", "No, no. That's what I thought I was not hearing as well.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, and sales is actually slightly negative.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. So you expected flat sales?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Virtually. We actually had slightly negative that we disclosed on the year-end call. I think it's like 0.2% -- 0.2% to 0.5% negative. And obviously, we experienced the opposite in Q1, weather normalized sales back on that Chart #2 there. You'll see what...", "Ashar Khan", "Yes, that's what I'm trying to sort. So when you came up with guidance for '14, you had flat sales in the forecast?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, slightly negative.", "Ashar Khan", "Slightly negative. So then can you tell us based on 1% delta, if sales are higher by 1%, what that helps -- how does that help electric margin?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I think, Ashar, I'm going from memory here. I don't have this in front of me. But I think like a 1% change in that is $0.02 to $0.03 per share.", "Ashar Khan", "$0.02 to $0.03 per share. So we have now like $0.04 -- 4%. So if this continues for the whole year, then it would be like a $0.12 positive delta? Is that fair?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's fair. That's a big if, though. We've got 2 consecutive quarters now of overall positive weather normalized usage, but we had 3 before that were negative. So I'm very optimistic at this point, but I'm not really ready to call it a trend yet.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay, okay, okay.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I am encouraged -- when you pair that with the unemployment rates that we've presented earlier, I'm encouraged by it.", "Ashar Khan", "Right. I mean, that's what I'm trying to think through, whether -- what's kind of happening. You have some soft quarters and then things turn around, and they become really kind of positive and things like that, whether this is sustainable or not sustainable.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, and it's still an open question. But I would say, the last 3 years, we've spent a lot of time talking about economic announcements, and most of those announcements now have translated into payroll. And there's folks out working, everything from the anchor being Boeing, to the tire expansions, to Nephron Pharmaceuticals just down the street from us here opening. So a lot of these things are translating into jobs, which are translating into consumer confidence, and I think we're seeing that in our numbers.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "My first question is about the nuclear construction. On Page 13, you removed the expression, \"We are confident in this range.\" So I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on sort of a maybe less commitment to the time schedule? And you mentioned that you'll have an updated schedule in the third quarter. What exactly is it that we're waiting for? And can you get any more specific as to what is going to happen in the third quarter?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, Andrew, what we're waiting for from the consortium, which is Chicago Bridge & Iron and Westinghouse, is based on the experience that they've had to date, factoring in the engineering schedule, the procurement schedule, their actual construction experience, worker efficiency, those kind of things, we want a new integrated project schedule. And then we hope that they will mitigate that to the extent that they can. And sometimes, what we put out is about the third quarter, we ought to have that from the consortium and have had time to look at it. And that really, from our perspective, will start the clock on our negotiations with them about what is a reasonable schedule and what's not a reasonable schedule. So while we remain confident in the plus-18 months that our Public Service Commission gives us from a contingency perspective, I don't know exactly today, until I get the information, the feedback back from the consortium, what it is that they're looking at.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Now is that -- would you consider that more fine-tuning or is it more sort of taking a fresh set of eyes and maybe starting from scratch? Not starting from scratch, but starting -- could there be major revisions, I guess?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, I think it's both. I think that the Chicago Bridge & Iron team coming in was new taking over from Shaw. The folks that hung over from Shaw have now been replaced with CB&I folks. So our entire team at the site is new, and the entire leadership team up through CB&I is new to us. So we've got a new team in. There's been some turnover in the Westinghouse folks as well. So I would consider some of it refinements and some of it actual experiences as they receive submodules in, for example, and they have to get to welding them on the site, doing installation as they've done concrete pours, those kinds of things. They're learning a lot. And so some of the things that they plan on when they originally quote a project is worker efficiency. Now while I don't know what that worker efficiency was that they quoted us upfront, they've obviously got some time under their belts now to figure out whether that's realistic or unrealistic. And they've also had some time to look at their supply chain. And where components have shown up on time, they'll factor that in. If they've been late, they'll factor that in. And so what I expect to get from them is just a new estimate of completion. And by estimate, I mean, a schedule. But again, I still expect it to come within our contingency, but I don't know exactly where it's going to be. And I'm certain they'll come back and say, \"But I might be able to improve that if you gave me just a little bit more.\" So that's what I mean when we say we'll start the discussion or the negotiation point, at that point when I get that schedule from them.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then as far as communicating that progress with us, is that something -- when you say third quarter, would that be like the next quarterly earnings call?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "The next quarterly earnings call will be a little early for that. It will probably be the call after that.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. Then the only other question I have on the more near-term stuff is, can remind us the plan for O&Ms for this year and maybe how you might adjust that in response to the strong start to the year?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, so the plan was generally around about a 3% increase in O&M. I think Q1, we're about 2%, so we're close to that plan. And some of the weather impact in Q1 caused us to delay some of our planned O&M spend. So there's some things that we were able to defer for a short period of time. In fact, with the kind of shoulder month weather we're having now, a lot of that is going on from plant maintenance to out on the T&D system. So I don't see a great deal of change in the O&M plan for the year at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I have a mix of questions, Jimmy, for both you and Steve. One, a financing question. You've reduced, per Page 10, your new nuclear CapEx for the year, for 2014. But you didn't revise your financing data for 2014. Just curious, why not kind of move the financing along with kind of the timing of some of the new nuclear?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, a very fair question. And the answer really goes back to the one that Steve just answered about this Q3 re-baseline. I've said all along, there's no urgency to -- particularly on the equity side. The earliest we needed it was late this year. So if anything, this takes a little pressure off of that. But really, I would like to get more information on the whole re-baseline and that whole discussion with the consortium before we make any final decisions on that.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And Steve, any insights at all -- I mean, the Chinese AP1000 project, Sanmen and Haiyang, are a couple of years ahead of both Vogtle and V.C. Summer in terms of the construction process. Just any insights or read across about whether those facilities in China look like they're going to come on time -- come online on time, on budget? Or whether there's any deviation of the project schedules for either of those 2?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "With respect to the budget, I don't think I have any clue. I don't know that they disclose budget information for the Chinese projects the same way that we do, so I just don't know. With respect to the schedule, they've been 2, 2.5 years ahead of us. I expect that to hold. So that would say that they are probably similarly delayed to us.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And any -- one last one. And Jimmy, this is probably for you. In the regulatory items or regulatory highlights you mentioned down at the bottom of Page 8, the gas RSA filing, just curious given the earned returns in the gas business so far for the rolling 12 months, do you expect to file for gas base rate increases in either jurisdiction?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, not in this timeframe. And frankly, the way the mechanism works in South Carolina, if anything, there's a potential for a small decrease, but not material from a financial standpoint. But I think it's just reflective of the cost control we've had across the whole business has benefited the gas business too, along with the growth. I mean, the customer growth keeps coming with this -- with the build in the economy, while we've controlled costs along the way.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And finally, we've seen your neighbor, Duke, talk about a need for incremental pipeline capacity into North Carolina. And just curious whether it's CGTC or at the holding company level, whether an opportunity exists for SCANA to either be an investor on a project like that or in a separate type of project? Whether there's even a need for incremental new gas pipeline to flow into your service territory?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, we've had an open season through our interstate company here very recently, and there's a lot of interest. But the way that works is, you go through that and mainly industrials express their preliminary interest. And then you've got to go through a sorting out process where you find out what's really a binding indication. And we're kind of in the middle of that now. We've not gotten to the binding part. So we'll have to see what comes out of that. I can tell you generally, the pipelines are full because of the price of gas being driven down by the shale gas. And there are a lot of industrial processes that would like to switch from other fuels to natural gas. And we got to sort out who's really serious about it now as opposed to who answered the first call. Having said that, I don't -- you're not going to see it be material to SCANA's overall earnings.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it, you don't view it as -- there's not a significant rate base opportunity for SCANA on the interstate pipeline side?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right, not to the SCANA level. And that will be significant to that subsidiary, but you're talking about a company with less than $200 million of rate base. So...", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Just really quick. Just a clarification on one of the questions, I think, Ashar was at. With the 1% -- sorry, the sales growth forecast, what are you guys forecasting now? I'm sorry to -- I didn't get it completely. What is your new sales -- retail sales forecast?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Okay. Let me try this one more time. Pardon for not being clear earlier. We have not changed our forecast. We've got a strong quarter to report here in Q1, but our forecast is for about 0.5% decline in 2014 compared to 2013 actual. Obviously, completely different direction here in Q1. Maybe at some point during the year that translates to a different forecast, but we're just not at that point yet, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then when we look at these rather strong numbers on a weather-adjusted basis, given the bag of the weather was so abnormal this quarter, does that give you any -- does that give you a little less confidence maybe in what these -- with the weather-adjustment calculation that you're doing? Or just -- does it give you any -- I mean, I know sometimes this is more of an art than a science. I'm just wondering, is that -- because the numbers do seem pretty high, just period. I mean, was there something else going on? I mean, 4%...", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I think that's a very fair question as well. So the thing that -- what I would say is, on a positive standpoint, we've had a couple of quarters in a row like this now. And Q4 was nowhere near as extreme as this was. I think it was fairly normal, the best I recall, from a weather standpoint. But to your question about, is carving out the weather effect an exact science, it absolutely is not. You got to make 2 major assumptions in that. And one is, how much of the customer load by class is non-weather sensitive and how much is weather sensitive? And then for the weather-sensitive part, how much is impacted by the extreme weather that was actually realized? So absolutely, it's modeled on an assumption basis. Is it precise? It's the best model we have. It's one that the industry obviously is challenged with when it's extremes like this. And that's another reason that I just don't get committed to trends based on 1 or 2 quarters.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. when do you think that you guys might take another look at sort of your annual forecast, I mean, for guidance purposes?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, for sure, each quarter. But in our business, Q3 is the big quarter. So Q2 is only about 15% of our annual operating plan from an earnings standpoint. So it's highly unlikely that we're going to come along at the end of Q2 and reassess our guidance at that point because so much of it is driven in the third quarter, just because of the cyclical nature, the heat in south.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question will be a follow-up from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to follow-up on one of Michael Lapides' questions and just go off a little bit tangentially there. How are your coal stockpiles doing right now? And are you having any trouble with rail and transport getting any coal?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Well, because we have shuttered a number of coal facilities, our situation is pretty good with the coal stockpiles. Now we're coming off a period where we had relatively high coal stockpiles, so perhaps not a big surprise. There have been some issues with delivery, particularly from rail, and we have the luxury of having port delivery available to us. And so we are looking into the possibility of receiving some shipments in through the Port of Charleston, and those go basically right to our Williams Station, so -- which is our largest single unit. So we will be offsetting some of what we may not be able to get via rail by ship receipts.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a quick question. You are off to a good start this year obviously with some things, maybe unusual, but with the weather-adjusted sales, if that sustains itself, you guys look like you're on target to do better than what you originally thought. So my question is, we see a lot of other companies, when this occurs, pull forward O&M expense and sort of use the cash in that sense. Would that be your intention possibly or would maybe a better path to sort of use the excess cash to invest in your infrastructure needs and reduce the equity that you need with the nuclear generation? So how do you think about that, I guess?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, Neil, I don't see a lot of variation in our O&M plan. We've been very disciplined about our O&M that's core to customer service and reliability. And for example, in the toughest times of the recession, we've maintained our vegetation management, trimming the trees. It helps us really keep good outage records with the customers. So we're not behind. So there's not a lot of bounce back or anything like that we need to do. Having said that, there's always some judgmental things that you can move around a little bit on timing of when you deal with them. But I don't see a huge variation in that. And of course, we've got plenty of capital need as you referenced there on our expansion with the new nuclear. And I would see us probably use it more for -- just to defray the needs for debt and equity as soon. I would just see it just kind of moving those things to the right maybe slightly. But honestly, Neil, I've been waiting 6 years to start having calls like these the last couple of quarters. We really see some confidence in the economy. It's been a tough run and I'm really encouraged by the economy. When you start looking at those unemployment rates back on that Slide 5, and you see that proxy that we build for our electric operating territory at just over 4.5%, I mean, you're getting down to functionally full employment there, and that's pretty exciting. It happens to be that the county -- our headquarters that's based in here has the lowest unemployment in the state, and we're excited about where we're headed.", "Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It looks like very good news and hopefully, it sustains throughout the course of the year.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I agree. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will be a follow-up from Ashar Khan of Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "I think it's been kind of answered. My question was regarding the nuclear CapEx delays and the impact on equity. It's been answered.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Thank you, Ashar.", "Operator", "Our next question will be a follow-up from Michael Weinstein of UBS.", "Michael Weinstein", "I just wanted to go back to Steven's question and just make sure that you guys are still -- that you are indeed confident you're still within the 18-month window. I think that was the thrust of his question. I heard you say confident. I just wanted to reiterate that though.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, we may have changed a word on the slide. I'm not sure about that. My review...", "Michael Weinstein", "But that wasn't intentional, right?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Detail about that slide. But we -- based on our discussions with the consortium, we're still confident at this point in time in the staying within the PSC-allowed contingency, which is plus-18 months.", "Michael Weinstein", "But when you look at the Slide 13, and you see the green box that you guys put in there, that's unchanged from before. So you're -- I mean, since you are awaiting a baseline, would it be fair to say that, that green box no longer really applies anymore, that you're simply somewhere in that 18-month window at this point?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes. Until I see something from the consortium that tells me I'm going to be outside of the box, remember that box was a band that was built around -- I think it was Q4 of '17 to Q1 of '18. And the consortium had been working to a schedule which was December of '17. So it's entirely possible that we could end up still within that green box. So until I find out that I'm not, I'm going to leave it where it is.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Dan, no sympathy from you either about the weather, right?", "Dan Jenkins", "No, no. So when we look at the projects on the nuclear plant that you have laid out on page -- Slide 18, are any of those contingent on the other items? So for example, does CA-01 have to happen before CA-03, or are they all kind of on parallel tracks?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "They're all being constructed on parallel track. But you are correct that CA-03 cannot be set until CA-01 is set. And then we need CA-01 in before I can get containment vessel Ring 2 in. And that really is a height limitation on even the world's largest Heavy Lift Derrick. I can't get over 2 ring sections, plus this very big module at the same time. So yes, you're correct that the CA-03 and the containment vessel Ring 2 are follow-ons to CA-01. So that's a very important one for us.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from David Paz of Wolfe Research.", "David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC", "I just had a question. Your current guidance and growth rate, does that assume that bonus D&A is not extended beyond '13?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's correct. It assumes -- it's based on current law.", "David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. Do you happen to know about how your growth rate would be impacted if it were extended, say, another year or 2?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "David, I don't see it materially impacting our growth rate. I mean, it's in the ballpark of $50 million to $75 million a year in cash. But I just don't see that material enough to impact growth rates of any significance. Again, that's kind of like the cash from the weather, right -- or, no, the cash from the economic growth. I mean, to me, it just allows you to push a little bit to the right on the planned debt and equity insurances.", "David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Got it. And your nuclear construction units aren't considered in service until they come online. I guess, just -- we'll keep thinking about them from a bonus depreciation law, if that were to be extended through your construction period, just how would that impact your ultimate rate base?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, no real impact on the nuclear side because you're exactly right, no depreciation there until they come online.", "Operator", "Our next question will be a follow-up from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to follow up. This is the first earnings call after the ORS put out their April 1 piece on the project. And one of the things that kind of stands out is, some of their commentary about milestones. And they had the section that kind of talked about how, of the 51 remaining milestones, that like 88% of them have been delayed to some point, and that they've even had to notify the commission of some that have been delayed more than 10 months. Can you just talk a little bit about, a, are these milestones that can get things back on track? Or b, is this just all tied and all part of the bigger, hey, look, we've had some initial delays, albeit kind of minor measured in months or even just a quarter or 2, and that this will all get kind of wrapped up and resolved when you get the integrated project schedule in the next 6 or 9 months?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "I think the answer is that, when we originally laid out our case to build these plants, so you're going back to hearings we had in 2008, we were required to submit at that point in time a milestone schedule. That milestone schedule had in it a number of things that were fairly imprecise at that point in time. So we're talking about a project that was going to be built over 10 years, and we had to supply a milestone schedule that had 146, as I recall, milestones. I think 60% of which or more are completed now. So it was not unusual that some of those milestones would move around. Now what we're seeing in the milestones of the Office of Regulatory Staff is concerned with is that they put out a -- I guess it's a self-imposed 10 months where they would notify the Public Service Commission of anything over that 10 months. So there are a number of them that are over 10 months. What we're concerned with is the plus-18 months, because we are considered within our schedule as long as we're within 18 months. Now there are a couple that are challenging the 18 months. One of them, I think, is that CA-03 set. So -- and a lot of things are dependent on how things go with the modules. So we continue to come back to -- even some of these milestone issues are a function of what goes on with the modules. So as long as the consortium hits their module dates, I think we should be within the 18-month contingency on all of them. That being said, there are still some challenges that we have outlined in our BLRA quarterly reports. And a couple of those are things like, reactor cooling pumps, squib valves. And while there are plans that are currently being worked to recover those schedules, we need to see them come to fruition before we would say that we're good on those yet. So there are some things that may challenge the 18 months, but I don't think any of the ones that are challenging that 18 months are really going to be impacting on the in-service dates for the units.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And big-picture question, I hadn't really asked this. What happens if the 18 month slips? Meaning, what -- from a regulatory perspective, if the 18 -- if you go beyond the 18-month timeline, what's the process from there?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Well, we would file for basically a schedule re-baseline with the Public Service Commission, which would be a full hearing process. And we would outlay what the reason is for delay. Intervenors would have an opportunity to challenge us. And we would go before the commission to say that we want to schedule re-baseline if we go over any of those milestones.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "And Michael, we've done that twice before, not because of exceeding the 18 months, but because of the original contingency being removed by the Supreme Court decision. We went through that process twice already for cost items that would have gone against the contingency. And the commission has endorsed those. And each time they did that, they changed the schedule for the latest information at that time. So it would be the same process again.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And as I understand that process, when the courts may go and take contingency out of the initial project, approved project budget, that it wasn't really what you'd call a contentious process. I mean, the commission kind of looked at it and said, \"Understood,\" and kind of things change around a little bit and kind of, \"Let's go from there.\"", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Remember, when the original Base Load Review Act was approved, it was February of 2009, it had entered a contingency fund. And what was challenged to the Supreme Court was not that we would never have to use contingency. What they didn't like was the fact that it was preapproved enough to us as to where we spend it. And there point was, we ought to be held accountable for the contingency and have to come back and ask for more when we run into contingency items. And that's really what the Supreme Court said. And so as -- we've done that now twice and the Public Service Commission has approved those each time.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And can you refresh, what was that contingency amount originally? So if they were -- if CBI comes back in their delays or you're beyond the 18 months, or just, I don't know, stuff happens. It's a big project. I'm just trying to think about how -- if I were a commissioner, I approved the project at x. But because of a court decision, it's really x minus something. And then if you come back say, \"Hey, look, I kind of need some of that minus,\" it's still not that much above what I had originally thought of as the project cost.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, the original contingency number I believe was $438 million. Now remember, that's our -- that was for our 55% share.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, thank you. And to summarize, we're off to a good start in 2014. The weather comes and goes, but I'm particularly encouraged by the economic indicators, especially unemployment rates and the apparent consumer confidence. We remain on track to meet our internal earnings targets and our new nuclear construction continues to progress. And finally, I want to mention our upcoming Analyst Day event to be held in New York on June 4. And please mark your calendars and plan to attend either in person or via the Internet.

(NYSE:SCG) Q2 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2014  3:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Susan Wright - Director of Investor Relations", "Jimmy E. Addison - Chief Financial Officer", "Stephen A. Byrne - Executive Vice President, President of Generation & Transmission", "Analysts", "Mike Weinstein - UBS", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Operator", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, July 31, 2014. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Susan Wright", "", "Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the second quarter of 2014.", "Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer for SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and economic update and information regarding customer growth and usage as well as regulatory activity. Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions.", "The slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com. Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA's home page, there is a yellow box containing a link to the new nuclear section of the website that contains a further link to project news and updates. In connection with this process we had discontinued our practice of furnishing on Form 8-K, the quarterly reports that SCE&G submits to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. Instead, the company now posts copies of these reports on the SCANA website.", "Please note that we have recently added another investor information link to the yellow box. The new other investor information section of the website contains a link to recent investor related information that cannot be found at other areas of the website. It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time to time maybe deemed material information that is not otherwise become public. In addition, I want to remind you that you can sign up under the Investor Relations section of scana.com for email alerts for financial reports and press releases. You can now sign up for email alerts when there is a new posting in the new nuclear and/or other investor information yellow box.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as shown on Slide two. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy. ", "Jimmy E. Addison", "", "Thanks, Susan, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide three. Basic earnings in the second quarter of 2014 were $0.68 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the same quarter of 2013. Please note that the electric weather normalization pilot ended in December 2013, and the Company\u2019s financials are now impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business.", "Accordingly, the improved results in the second quarter are attributable to increases in electric margins due to abnormal weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase, and customer growth along with higher gas margins. These increases were partially offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx related items including property taxes and share dilution.", "Now please turn to Slide four. Basic earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2014, were $2.05 versus $1.73 in 2013. Increases in electric and gas margins were partially offset by higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program.", "Now, I'd like to speak about our operation and maintenance expenses for the year. As we previously mentioned, a strategic goal going forward will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. One of the instruments in achieving this goal is O&M cost control. We estimated O&M would grow approximately 3% in 2014, and we continue to have confidence in that estimate. Please note under provisions of a regulatory order related to our DSM programs, we reduced second quarter O&M by $5 million, so year-to-date we're very close to our plan.", "Now on Slide five, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's second quarter 2014 earnings denoted in blue were up $0.07 compared to 2013, driven largely by increases in electric margins, which were due primarily to $0.06 of abnormal weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase, and customer growth as well as higher gas margins. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses as well as expenses related to our capital program, including property taxes, depreciation, and share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.28 due primarily to higher electric margins.", "PSNC Energy\u2019s earnings for the second quarter of 2014, shown in red, increased $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2013 primarily due to increased margins from customer growth. For the six-months period ended June 30, shown in red, basic earnings were also up $0.01 per share consistent with the quarter.", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green reported a seasonal loss for the second quarter of $0.02 per share consistent with the second quarter of 2013. Year-to-date earnings are $0.13 per share compared to $0.14 per share in the prior year. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2014 consistent with the second quarter of the prior year. For the six-months period these businesses reported basic earnings per share of $0.08 in 2014 compared to $0.04 in 2013.", "I would like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide six. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far in 2014, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $400 million with expectations of creating over 4,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Port of Charleston continues to see increased traffic and finished its June 2014 fiscal year with container volume up 8% over 2013. As I've mentioned in the past, it's estimated that one in every five jobs in South Carolina is related to port volume. This increased traffic is a very good sign for the local economy.", "At the bottom of the slide you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 5.3%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.8%.", "Slide seven presents customer growth in electric sales. On top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric and gas growth rates as of the end of June are 1.4% and 2.3%, respectively. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina also added customers at a 2.3% rate.", "The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014. Overall, weather normalized total retail sales were up 0.5% on a 12 month ended basis. Now please turn to slide eight which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of a regulated rate base of approximately $8.3 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.", "In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The non-GAAP earned return for the 12 months ended June 30 in the electric business is approximately 10%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% for higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We're very pleased with the execution of our strategy.", "Continuing down the page on our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. We have had incremental CWIP in the last year of approximately $595 million, and as Steve will discuss shortly, we filed our latest request for advised rates back in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We are allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to operate these businesses close to those returns. SCE&G's gas business returns are measured each year through the Rate Stabilization Act. We expect a small decrease effective November 1 to adjust the ROE to 10.25%. This decrease should be approximately $3 million on an annual basis.", "Slide nine presents our CapEx forecast which has not changed from what was presented in Analyst Day. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report filed in May. At the bottom of the slide, is our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.", "Now, please turn to slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018 which has also not changed since our presentation at Analyst Day. On May 27 of this year, SCE&G issued $300 million of 50-year bonds at 4.5%. On the equity side, we continue to target 52% to 54% equity levels that the operating company, SCE&G.", "While we estimate incremental equity issuances of $425 million above the 401(k) DRIP proceeds, its unlikely that the issuances will occur exactly as presented in the slide. We have not decided how or when these additional equity financings will occur as they are subject to the changes in the funding needs for planned project expenses. However, based on cash flows to date, and planned construction payments, it is getting less likely that we will need to issue any equity in 2014 to meet our targeted cap structure.", "Now on Slide 11, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.45 to $3.65 basic earnings per share along with our internal target of $3.55 per share. Weather has obviously contributed significantly to earnings year-to-date. We will reevaluate our guidance after the third quarter, our most significant quarter for electric earnings. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next three to five year period. We continue to estimate that our effective tax rate for 2014 will be approximately 32%.", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Stephen A. Byrne ", "Thanks Jimmy. I\u2019d like to begin by discussing some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Please turn to slide 12, which presents an aerial view of the new nuclear site that was taken back in May. In the middle you can see the Heavy Lift Derrick or HLD and the track that it uses to travel 360 degrees in a circle.", "The Unit 2 and Unit 3 excavations can be seen to the left and the right of the HLD. In the upper right hand section of the slide you can see some of the cooling towers. Cooling towers 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha are structure complete and we are working on conduit power cables and other commodities now. Just where the cooling tower is you can see the Module Assembly Building or MAB where the Unit 2 module CA-20 was recently completed and moved out and where assembly of Module CA-01 is currently taking place. Since this photo was taken there have been some significant changes in the nuclear island for both of these units and as we discussed on our analyst day event and I will recap shortly.", "On Slide 13, you can see pictures of the Unit 2 Nuclear Island. In the upper left hand corner, you can see the containment vessel lower bowl that was placed inside the CR-10 Module or support cradle. In early May, we placed CA-20, at roughly 2 million pound structural Module using the Heavy Lift Derrick.", "On the right hand side of the slide, you can see it placed next to the containment vessel lower bowl. On the bottom left of the slide you can see where the first ring section of the containment vessel was set on the lower bowl. This ring section weighs approximately 900 tons and is made of 1.75-inch thick steel. Here, you can also see the large equipment hatch openings. The smaller openings are personal hatches.", "On slide 14, you can see pictures of the Unit 3 nuclear island. On the left of the slide, you can see where the CR-10 module was built on the base mat. On the right side of the slide, you can see the containment vessel lower bowl has now been set. Slide 15 shows a schematic of the turbine building that illustrates how the various turbine building modules will look when completed. All of these modules have now been placed in their final locations.", "Turning to slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building. Comparing the schematic from the previous slide you can see all the previously mentioned modules have been completed and placed on the turbine building base mat, as well as progress being made on the structural steel for the surrounding turbine building itself. On slide 17, you can see a Feedwater heater being placed inside the condenser. Slide 18 shows the turbine building basement. A condensate pumps, strain coolers, and circling water outlets from the cooling towers are clearly visible.", "Slide 19, shows a few of the components that have arrived on site. On the top left, you'll see a picture of the Unit 2 generator stator [rotationary] component. The generator converts the mechanical energy from the turbine rotation into electrical energy. On the top right, you see the Unit 2 main transformer sometimes referred to as the generator step-up transformer, or GSU. This transformer increases the voltage from the main generator to the 230,000 volts that you find in the switch yard.", "On the bottom left, you see the Unit 2 Core Makeup tank which is a part of the passive cooling system. On the bottom right, you see Unit 2 water boxes. Cooling water flows into these water boxes and then through the condenser tubes to cool exhaust steam from the turbine.", "Slide 20, shows more components arriving on the site. Left hand side is the integrated reactor head package which allows for rapid removal during refueling. Top right shows auxiliary transformers, and bottom right are the non-safety related diesel generators. These diesel generators are supplied but are not needed to mitigate an accident.", "On slide 21, you can see even more arrivals on-site by rail. These are the Unit 3 turbine casings. On slide 22, you can see a picture of the Sanmen plant in China from back in May. At this point they are approximately two years ahead of us in construction. Here you can see both of their AP1000 really starting to take shape.", "On slide 23, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018 as reflected in the May 2014 Base Load Review Act, or BLRA, quarterly report. As you can see the next several years are considered the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related projected customer rate increases onto the BLRA and are associated with the right hand axis. As we stated during our last call, the incremental 5% future acquisition of the new nuclear project from Santee Cooper will not affect these projected BLRA increases.", "Please now turn to Slide 24. As discussed at Analyst Day, we filed our BLRA quarterly status update for the first quarter of 2014 in May as well as our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. The Office of Regulatory Staff has completed their review of our request and is recommending to the Commission a $66.2 million revenue increased, or a rate increase of about 2.82%. We concur with their recommendation and anticipate the request in increase in rates effective November 1.", "On slide 25 you'll see a breakout of total new nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see the project costs as filed in the May 2014 BLRA report. Project costs are currently under running the original approval received from the Public Service Commission in South Carolina. As you can see, this change is largely attributable to the lower escalation. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein - UBS", "Hi, actually it's Mike Weinstein. How are you doing?", "Steve Byrne", "Hi, Mike good.", "Mike Weinstein - UBS", "Hey could you, I noticed that the slide that usually talks about the different modules, their expected [on-hook] dates is not in the slide deck. I'm just wondering if you can provide an update on that.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Sure. This is Steve. As we've said before, we're awaiting a new integrated project schedule from the consortium. We anticipate that yet this quarter, and until we get that, I don't want to put out dates that I might have to revise once again. We're waiting for those dates to come back in before we start revising any of those charts.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 UBS", "Got it. In terms of the equity, the equity needs and the fact that the possibility that you might not have to issue any equity this year, is that related more to the strong weather-related results this year? Or is it more because of delayed spending? What's the factor there?", "Jimmy E. Addison", " ", "It's a combination of both, Michael. I'd say it's probably a slightly more related to the construction schedule than it is the weather, but certainly both are big contributors.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Good, afternoon. Thanks.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Sure.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "This is really a follow on to that second question, somewhat, I was wondering if you could quantify the amount of cash that you've gotten from those weather benefits, and how that would play into those equity needs. Is it as simple as taking the incremental earnings there and multiplying it in shares outstanding, or is there some way to quantify the cash?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No. It's pretty straightforward like that. It's basically the earnings per share times the shares outstanding, but I'll kind of make that easy for you. It's about $35 million or so year-to-date. And of course you'd have to net it of tax, given the slight difference in timing of when you pay the taxes, but that part of the loan is roughly $20 million.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay. That is when you talk about the weather not being a complete reason for the delay in the equity issuance; it's a relatively small amount?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right. I would say, I've been saying for quite a while, that if we didn't need equity in 2014 at the earliest it would be the end of the year. This is not a radical change in the message.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay. Great. Then on the escalation cost, what's the big driver there that's been taking that down so much relative to the expectation?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Our escalation is tied to an index, and when we had our Base Load Review Act hearings back in 2008 we had to specify the index. We picked a Handy-Whitman index, and it just continues to come back lower each six-month update.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Is that an inflation type issue, or is there something else?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "It's low inflation, but it really looks at costs specifically by sector. Then one of the indices we use is specific to nuclear. It's just a reflection of the fact that the terrible economy or the rebound from that economy has not resulted in high inflation. Early on, it was the impact of the poor economy, and now we're not seeing a rebound in inflation. So far it's been a very positive impact on the project.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Andy Levi of Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "Hey guys, how are you?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Good, Andy.", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "Just two quick questions, one is fairly simple. In the first quarter, you had given like quarterly numbers as far as sales. In this quarter, you didn't. Is it possible to get this, on the weather normalized basis, residential, commercial, industrial sales, the actual growth?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. We have traditionally just offered the 12 month moving average because it tends to take some of that volatility out. We did provide that for the first quarter just for the quarter. I would say for just the residential, if we looked at it alone for the just for the quarter, it was down about twice of what the 12 month moving average is, just continuing to show that volatility. So we had a couple of quarters where it's been up. This quarter it's been down a little, and this just continues to show that volatility out there. Overall, it was down about 1% for the quarter, but we prefer and we pay attention internally to the 12 month moving average.", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "That's weather normalized that you're talking about?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right. Yes.", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "I remember the first quarter you had the weather was so weird in the first quarter, it's hard to figure out what the real weather normalized number is.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "It's a little weird in the second quarter too. It was over 40% higher than the normal cooling degree days in the quarter. We had cold first quarter and a hot second quarter.", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "Okay. Here, we didn't experience that. You're not that far away.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Right.", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "Then the second question, I don't know if Steve wants to answer it, and I asked certainly the same question. So I -- as I said, I apologize for the question, but just kind to need to ask anyway. With CBI, we've noticed stock has come down quite a bit on various research reports relative to their finances. And I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that, and not specifically on their finances but just whether we should be concerned, or you have any concerns on the financial health of CBIs. The stock's off like 35% in the last two months, and whether you've had any discussions relative to making sure everything's already, and whether it has affected operations at all.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Let me understand, Andy. You're saying I have a choice as to whether or not answer the question?", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "I didn't say choice. You can always have a choice whether to answer the question. I feel bad about asking it, but just feel that I need to.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "I can only tell you what we see on the project level. I can't really speak to their financing, their stock price. What we see at the project level is a continued commitment to do whatever it is they need to do to rectify the situation that we've gotten into with modular deliveries and including outsourcing of some of those modules for the second unit to other places which obviously is going to increase their costs in those modules. So they're doing the right things from our perspective, and we haven't seen any impact at the site level.", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "So operationally, everything is good?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "That's correct.", "Andy Levi - Avon Capital", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "The next question is from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital. Please go ahead.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Hey Jimmy.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Hello Jim.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "", "How are you?", "", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Just fine.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "I have a couple of questions. First one is there are two softballs, okay? The first one is on this pension legislation that's weaving its way through Congress. For those who are fully funded, there's an ability to take out some cash. Does that affect you if it actually becomes law? Do you know?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I do not know the answer to that, but I highly doubt that we would plan to take any cash related to that. We're in a situation where our plan is fully funded as you're alluding to. We've got a strategy to continue to derisk that plan over the next several years by moving more into the fixed over the next several years, so we're satisfied. We're pleased with where we are.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Okay. And the second question relates to the whole schedule with the resolution of this construction consortium dispute. I thought originally you guys might come out with updated timing and how that resolution was on or around September 30. Is that still a good date?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "I think what we said is that we anticipate the consortium coming to us with the schedule this quarter, and that that would kick off for us a negotiation process, both on the duration of the schedule and their means and methods. So what I think they're going to be looking for from us is, here's how we see it going from here on, out based on all of the factors we've seen so far, modular deliveries, craft productivity, other supply chain issues, weather, whatever you want to factor in, and then say, does this look reasonable? And you know based on your experience, are there things that we could change in order to yet expedite the schedule? I haven't seen it yet. I anticipate seeing it soon, but again that's going to kick off a negotiation base for us, so I wouldn't call it final until we're finished with that negotiation.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "I'm a little confused. So negotiations have not started, right? Steve?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "That's correct. ", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Okay. Then you're going to be silent until you have a final deal in hand with them? Or are you going to give us some metrics along the way that you're either entering negotiations, or here's what they're proposing and now we're entering negotiations? Just so we can book end this issue.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes. I think, one, it's going to depend on what I see from them. Then we're going to be working on if they give me something I don't like, what could be the possible cost implications of that? Then what mitigation things could they propose, or we propose? That's what I mean by the negotiations, and again, I expect to get it this quarter. Will we go silent? I don't know that I'm going to be discussing it until I see it's going to be more final, but if we have any kind of disclosure issues that might crop out of this, obviously as soon as we think something is solid, even if we don't have something fully negotiated, we'll disclose it.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "I'm just thinking out loud here, but if they come back instead of being a $200 million dispute, pick a number, $400 million, does that change in terms of, is that disclosure issue right away for you guys, that you'd have to say the dispute number is now $400 million or something? Just so we can understand what's going on?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "From a disclosure perspective I think what we'd have to do is we'd have to evaluate whether we think that's a real number or not. Remember, we put the $200 million number out there, not that was a consortium number. That was just our estimate of the delay that they gave us on the commercial operation dates. I think it was just prior to our Analyst Day last year. That would have been about June on 2013.", "So with this new fully integrated project schedule, they're factoring a lot more things in. They're even looking at engineering completion. They're factoring in assistance they might get from outside, parent company like Toshiba for Westinghouse, for example. That's what I anticipate they're going to give me, and when I first see it, I'm just not going to be in a position to say, here it is. I want to, one, digest it, and two, see if we agree. So what I anticipate is, what a contractor will typically do, is they'll give you something that's out of bounds, and anticipating that you'll negotiate something different. I don't think it's going to be any different than that.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Okay, but do you think it will be, and I hate to use the term, kitchen sink meaning they'll give you everything at this time, instead of piecemeal? Is that what you're expecting, at least, that's your expectation? ", "Stephen A. Byrne", "I think on the schedule, they'll give me everything. We may have some decisions to make at that point as to paths we may go down, mitigation paths we may go down. Any kind of a cost implication, one, it would have to be negotiated, and two, it might depend on which path we choose.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Okay.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "I'm not trying to deliberately avoid answering the question, but it is a dynamic situation. I've got to see what I have to start with. I anticipate that before the end of the quarter, and then we'll have our team evaluate it along with their team, and we'll negotiate to something final. I'd love to be able to say, we'll have that on X date, but I just don't know what X date is.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Okay. Then just \u2013 I guess the last question with all this, sorry to beat this to death, once you get that, what's the process mechanically? Going to the Commission for approval, the new costs, whatever they might be, how does all that work?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Under the Base Load Review Act, we can go back in annually just with an update on the project, and that will be on ex [parte] fashion. If we have a change to the approved schedule or cash flows, then we would go in with a filing. We'd make a filing before the Commission, and it would be a full-fledged hearing before our Public Service Commission.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Okay. Then an expected timeline, how long do you think that would take?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Generally, from the time we file, it will be a few months before the hearing. Then I can't remember if, ordinarily let's say if it were a rate case, it's six months from the time we file to the time they have to render an opinion. I'm not certain as we sit here whether that's the case for the Base Load Review Act or not, but generally they don't deviate from that too much.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Will that be a separate proceeding to the BLRA review with the annual cost, to be rolled into the 2015 recovery petition?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Remember, that when you say annual cost, we just give an ex parte briefing to the Commission if we're not asking for anything additional.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "Okay.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "If we were to go in, we might roll our ex parte briefing into that case in which case we wouldn't go back again, but we will make an ex parte briefing at some point this year because we haven't done it yet. If we decide we need to make a filing, and that's this year, we could roll it in. If it rolls into next year, then we'll do the ex parte this year, and we'll do the filing next year.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Jim, let me add, if you're asking if it's separate from our annual BLRA rate request and the increase each November, yes, it'd be separate from that.", "Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital", "That's the question I was asking. Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the time.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question is from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital", "Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple questions on the near-term trends, first of all, how has the weather in July been shaping up for you down there?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "It was rather warm the first part of the month, and then abnormally cool the latter part. Overall, just anecdotally, it's been fairly normal, but you wouldn't have thought that if you were here at any one point in time.", "Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital", "Okay. The reason I ask is because when I look at the year-to-date trend and the rolling 12 months, I'm a little surprised that you're still sticking with the internal target of $3.55 rather than moving that toward the higher end. Are there any specific items in the second half that might be a drag year-over-year, or is that just being conservative?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "The only thing is that the summer quarter, this third quarter, is the peaking quarter in the electric business. We get that quarter on our belt before we ever consider reevaluating those targets.", "Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital", "Sure. Okay. Then in terms of the equity of $100 million for this year, did the original guidance range assume that would be later in the year as you've described, or would it be the guidance range assuming more of a distribution throughout the year?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No. It's the former. It presumed an end-of-year issuance, so it had very little effect if anything on the weighted average shares outstanding and therefore on the EPS.", "Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital", "Okay. Now, if that doesn't get pulled before the end of the calendar year, should we assume that would be an additional $100 million early next year? Or would that be lowered by the amount of this year benefiting from weather, and whatever else might be driving you towards the higher end of guidance?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "First, let me say it's all dependent upon all of these questions that have been asked of Steve earlier. So if there's an impact from the construction schedule and timing of construction payments, it will certainly impact the CapEx and therefore the financing. But if it's moved into 2015, and everything else were consistent, it would be probably in addition to $15 million.", "Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital", "Okay.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Instead of $125 million in 2015, $225 million.", "Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital", "Got it. Okay. Then lastly just on the usage, it's been pretty consistent, the 12 months average of about 0.5% weather adjusted versus the account growth of more like 1.25%. Any change in your view about the drag from conservation of energy efficiency?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No. Not really. There's a lot of efficiency going on across the board from HVAC to CFL bulbs, etcetera, and our best estimates are that we're past the midpoint on the saturation of the CFL from the latest information I've seen, but those are estimates. We don't have a precise inventory obviously. I'd say we're moving past that point.", "Customer growth continues to slowly tick up on new customers added. All the indications are around the economy that it continues to pick up from the industrial recruitment side, continued announcements that translate ultimately into jobs, and 12 to 36 months that translate into customer residential growth. We continue to feel good about those, and I guess no real view change on the efficiency outside of the light bulb standards.", "Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "The next question is from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Good afternoon.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Hello, Dan.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "So I wanted to just follow up on what you were just talking about a little bit, given that you showed year-over-year customer growth in the electric side of 1.4%, yet it looks like per residential commercial the weather adjusted volume was still down like 0.75% to 1%. Is that kind of -- how should we think about that going forward? Is that kind of a new steady state or how will customer growth translate into volume growth?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I think difficult to project that. That's why we've spoken consistently the last several quarters that we don't get too hung up when we have a good quarter or two in a row like we did in Q4 and Q1. We don't get too concerned when we see a slight downtick here in Q2 in that residential category specifically.", "One other thing I would say is the last couple of quarters in particular have been extreme weather, extreme cold in Q1, extreme warm, over 40% cooling degree days above normal in Q2. That makes it difficult to really determine exactly how much of the margin change is due to weather and how much is due to non-weather-related consumption. I know one of the earlier questions was about, let's get precisely into Q2 numbers, etcetera, as to the margins, non-weather. It's really difficult to get that precise. We can put a number down to the right side of the decimal, but if you start drawing any long-term conclusions about that, all you can assure is that you're probably not going to hit it.", "I'd just caution you to step back from that a little bit and try not to project a whole lot around it. What I do know is you look at those unemployment rates, that's real, and that's what usually translates into people's confidence is their personal budgets. We're real encouraged by what's going on with industrial recruitment and ultimately with jobs.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Related to the industrial, given the projects and activity you're seeing, do you expect the 3.7% area to be a reasonable growth rate for second half as well then?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "3.7%?", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Industrial.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, our industrial base is very diverse. We don't have anything at more than 25% in any one sector. There's a lot that goes into that. That's not something you can just model and project it linearly, but each customer is unique, and we put together a plan based upon working with each of those industrials. It's hard to predict that. I wouldn't get that precise, on the 3.7%.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Going back to the nuclear build, so what are the key critical path items that you'll be working on in the third quarter here that we'll see, should anticipate talking about in October? Is it the CA-05 and CA-01, or what are the items we should be focused on?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "The modular construction of AP1000 units really has about six big, they call them the big six, structural modules, and that's the CA-01, 02, 03, 04, 05, and 20. So 20 was set, so the next big ones are going to be 05 and 01. 04 was set also. So 20 and 04 are behind us. So I think its 05, then 01, then 03. Those are the next things.", "We're working on the ring sections for the containment vessel. We've placed one ring on top of the containment vessel, lower bowl for Unit 2, and we're working on ring sections for both Units 2 and 3. We will continue with those. We continue to receive parts and pieces from all over the world, received the Unit 3 and [wish] to separate re-heaters last week. Those parts continue to come in, and we're looking for where we're staging them, where we're storing them.", "We continue to work the turbine building for Unit 2, and anticipate that at some point soon we'll pour the basemat for the turbine building for Unit 3. In general the Unit 3 stuff as you might expect is going a little bit better because we learned lessons on 2, and they get faster for 3, but the Unit 2 stuff is the critical modules that you talked about.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, just a couple questions, in your earnings release you don't give a balance sheet or cash flow statement. I'm just curious. If I look at slide 9 and the CapEx forecast for 2014, where are you year-to-date relative to that forecast, meaning that $1.5 billion number? Are you, you've spent almost half of that in the first six months of the year? Are you running north of that, south of that? I'm just trying to think through uses and sources of cash for the year.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. Michael, I don't have the exact dollars in front of me, but we are slightly behind that CapEx budget. At this point I'd say probably about 10%. What I don't know right off hand is how it falls out in buckets by month or by quarter, but we're slightly behind that CapEx budget to date but not significantly.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And that implies that on the nuclear component of it that $805 million, you're running it close to half of that level for the year-to-date?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I just don't know that. We made the filing. You see down below, the 2014 number into the blue box at the bottom, says there's $595 million to occur by June 30 of that $805 million. We made our filing with the BLRA, and we ended up slightly less than that I think, so not a great deal of change there.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. Very helpful. And just I want to make sure I understand some of the rate changes that are happening, so $66 million revenue increased tied to the BLRA that starts November of this year. Then the $3 million, I think you were talking about on the gas business, that's the SCE&G gas business, and it's a $3 million annualized rate decreased that starts in November?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That's right.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Got it. Then last question, just trying to think about weather normalization, so second quarter I would assume all the uplift is on the electric side. The first quarter, is there a way to break apart how much of that weather benefit was North Carolina electric versus South Carolina electric versus maybe SCANA Energy and even South Carolina gas? ", "Jimmy E. Addison", "We don't have a North Carolina electric company. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "I live in North Carolina. You know what I meant. North Carolina gas. My [bet].", "Jimmy E. Addison", "There's not a significant amount. The mechanisms that we have in South Carolina gas account for weather normalization as well as the utilization tracker in North Carolina accounts for weather. So the short answer is very, very little would relate unless those mechanisms aren't completely 100% picking it all up, but that's the intention in the formulas, so really all of it was related to electric.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. That makes sense. Jimmy, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time. ", "Jimmy E. Addison", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our next question is a follow up from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein - UBS", "Hi, it's Mike again. One last question about the cost estimates and the dispute, the $200 million that you were talking about how it could possibly be increased as a result of other things that might come in. Is it your understanding, how much of that is target costs? I guess target costs would be stuff that could escalate and could be responsibility of the purchaser, you? How much of it is fixed and would be considered the responsibility of the consortium? The reason I ask is only because I know that regulators are expecting that most of these costs would be fixed.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Michael, I don't know that we have a breakdown of that. Again, until I see it I won't know what it is exactly, but certainly there will be some in each of those buckets. Also, I would anticipate that some of it would be in escalation costs. The escalation could be spread over all of the buckets. Then obviously, we may dispute some of those as we indicated with the $200 million when we talked about that over a year ago.", "Some of it will be in just increased onus costs, so if I have people there for extra periods of time, I'm not going to back off on the hiring because I really need to staff. Hiring is going pretty well, and we're able to get good quality people. I don't want turn to turn that -- off, so if those folks are there for a longer period of time that would be higher onus costs. If the consortium has folks there for longer, that would be in the target bucket. Otherwise, it's really looking like escalation. It's not per se the fixed pieces but it would only be that small amount of escalation on the fixed pieces that might change.", "Mike Weinstein - UBS", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Thank you. And to summarize we're very pleased with our results through midyear, and we remain on track to meet our earnings targets, and our new nuclear construction project continues to progress. We thank you all for joining us today, and we thank you for your interest in SCANA. Have a great day.", "Operator", "The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Operator", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. I apologize for the technical issues and delay experienced earlier. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, October 30, 2014. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Susan Wright", "Thank you, and welcome to our earnings call. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.", "During the call Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and related matters, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA's home page, there is a yellow box containing a link to the new nuclear section of the website that further contains a link to project news and updates. In connection with this process, we have discontinued our practice of furnishing on Form 8-K the quarterly reports that SCE&G submits to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. Instead, the company now posts copies of these reports on the SCANA website.", "Please note that we have recently added an other investment information link to the yellow box. The new other investor information section of the website contains a link to recent investor-related information that cannot be found at other areas of the website. It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time to time may be deemed material information that is not otherwise become public.", "In addition, I want to remind you that you can sign up under the Investor Relations section of scana.com for e-mail alerts for financial reports and press releases. You can now also sign up for e-mail alerts when there is a new posting in the new nuclear and/or the other investor information yellow box.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3.", "Basic earnings in the third quarter of 2014 were $1.01 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the same quarter of 2013. Please note that the electric weather normalization pilot ended in December 2013, and the company's financial results are now impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business.", "Accordingly, the improved results in the third quarter are attributable to increases in electric margins due to abnormal weather, continued recovery of financing costs through the Base Load Review Act or BLRA and customer growth. We estimate the impact of abnormal weather added $0.07 per share in electric margins for the quarter. These increases were partially offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx-related items, including property taxes, depreciation, interest expense and share dilution.", "Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2014, were $3.06 per share versus $2.67 in 2013. Increases in electric and gas margins were partially offset by higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program. We estimate abnormal weather added $0.23 per share to electric margins on a year-to-date basis.", "Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2014 earnings denoted in blue were up $0.11 compared to 2013. This was driven largely by increases in electric margins, which were due primarily to abnormal weather, continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses as well as expenses related to our capital program, including property taxes, interest expense and share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.39 due primarily to higher electric and gas margins.", "PSNC Energy shown in red reported a seasonal loss of $0.02 for the third quarter of 2014 compared to a loss of $0.03 for the same quarter of 2013. For the 9-month period ended September 30, 2014, basic earnings were up $0.02 per share over the same period of 2013.", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green, reported a seasonal loss for the third quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.03 for the third quarter of 2013. Year-to-date earnings were $0.11 per share, consistent with the prior year.", "SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported the loss of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2014 compared to flat earnings for the third quarter of the prior year. This is primarily the result of lower margin in the Energy Marketing business and higher interest expense at the holding company. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported basic earnings of $0.02 in 2014 compared to $0.04 in 2013.", "I'd like to touch on the economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far, in 2014, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $630 million, with expectations of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories.", "Obviously, one of the largest economic development activities currently ongoing in the state of South Carolina is the building of 2 new nuclear units at V.C. Summer station. The construction workforce now numbers over 3,000, along with the addition of over 500 full-time employees hired directly by SCE&G to begin preparation to operate the plants once construction is complete.", "To meet the demands for these new nuclear workforce, programs have been created at various colleges and universities, creating further economic expansion. The majority of contract employees are from the state of South Carolina or from the region. So the project is significantly impacting the local and state economy. Its operation will enable South Carolina to support continued economic growth, while producing clean, efficient energy for decades to come.", "At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with rates for 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.6%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 6.1%. Impacting the state's unemployment rate is the introduction of approximately 17,000 people to the workforce since last quarter. However, the employment outlook still remains positive as over 21,000 South Carolinians have found work and the state unemployment rate has dropped by 7/10 of a point since September of 2013.", "Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric rates. On the top of the slide, our customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at an annual rate of 1.3%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at an identical 2.5% rate.", "The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2014. Overall, weather-normalized, total retail sales were up 7/10 of a percent on a 12 months ended basis driven mainly by strong industrial demand. We continued to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated efficiencies.", "Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.8 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which were allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30 in the electric business is approximately 10%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We're very pleased with the execution of our strategy.", "Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. The Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently approved our request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $561 million to our rate base. And we will implement a rate increase in November of approximately 2.8%.", "Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continue to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to operate these businesses close to those returns.", "SCE&G's gas business returns are measured each year through the rate stabilization act. We recently received approval for a small decrease effective with the first billing cycle in November, which equates to a $2.6 million reduction on an annual basis.", "Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report filed in August and does not include any additional cost or scheduled delays estimated by the Consortium as we are in the midst of the negotiation process at this time. At the bottom of the slide, we recapped the new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.", "Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it's unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes and funding needs for planned project expenses. On May 27 of this year, SCE&G issued $300 million of 50-year bonds at 4.5%. On the equity side, we've issued approximately $75 million from our 401(k) matching and DRIP plans and continue to target 52% to 54% equity levels at the operating company, SCE&G. However, based upon cash flows and the planned construction payments to date, we have pushed $100 million of additional equity issuances from 2014 to 2015 to meet our targeted cap structure, as I suggested was a possibility on our previous call. We currently estimate we will not require any of this deferred equity until the latter half of 2015.", "Similarly, we are deferring the planned $300 million debt issuance from Q4 2014 to Q1 2015. Overall, we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Obviously, the construction delay has slowed expenditures, but they were also significantly reduced by lower-than-anticipated escalation as well.", "The delay is a matter of timing, but the escalation on those components already received or completed will result in permanent savings.", "We're very pleased to report that earlier this month, we successfully extended our largest credit facility by 1 year. The facility totaled $1.6 billion and covers 5 years, and now will expire in October of 2019. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction. We also have an additional $200 million for peak construction liquidity at SCE&G, which will expire in October 2016.", "I would like to thank our banks for their support of our liquidity needs and therefore, our nuclear project.", "Now on Slide 11. Remaining unchanged is our long-term outlook of 3% to 6% growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on the 2013 weather-normalized base of $3.40 of basic earnings per share. We're adjusting our guidance for 2014 to reflect our results to date through the third quarter. Our previous range of $3.45 to $3.65 is adjusted to $3.70 to $3.90. This reflects the $0.23 of weather experienced year-to-date in the electric business and the expectation of normal weather in Q4.", "We continue to estimate that our effective tax rate for 2014 will be approximately 32%.", "And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy. I want to begin by discussing the preliminary new nuclear construction schedule on cost information we received from the Consortium. As previously discussed, the Consortium began a full free baselining of V.C. Summer Unit 2 and Unit 3 construction schedules to incorporate project delays associated with engineering completion, construction lessons learned and component procurement and fabrication. In August, we received preliminary information relative to this rebaselining in which the Consortium indicated that the substantial completion of Unit 2 is expected to occur in late 2018 or the first half of 2019 and that the substantial completion of Unit 3 would be approximately 12 months later.", "As indicated in our website, in the new nuclear deployment or NND yellow box update, the Consortium has provided preliminary EPC cost estimates, principally related to these delays to achieve the late 2018 substantial completion date for Unit 2. SCE&G's 55% portion of this preliminary estimate has approximately $660 million, which is in 2007 dollars and would be subject to escalation.", "It also excludes any owner's cost amounts associated with the delays. The $200 million that we referred to in previous disclosures starting at our June 2013 Annual Analyst Meeting regarding potential cost increases associated with prior schedule delays included escalations on owner's costs. So excluding the amounts attributable to those items, the balance of the $200 million is included in the $660 million and would not be an addition to it.", "The EPC costs fall roughly into 3 buckets: fixed; firm; or target costs. The target costs are impacted by changes in the construction schedule as major -- a major component of this bucket is labor. Other non-EPC cost components impacted by the delays in the construction schedule and not included in the $660 million estimate are owner's costs and escalation costs. It is too early to determine owner's costs as we are in the midst of negotiation processing with the Consortium. while the preliminary schedule on cost estimates are under review by SCE&G in Santee Cooper and it is anticipated that further study evaluation and negations associations will occur, we cannot predict when the revised schedule on cost estimates will be finalized.", "The preliminary cost estimates and preliminary substantial completion dates do not reflect consideration of the liquidated damages provision of the EPC contract, which would partly mitigate any such delays. They also do not reflect all of the possible efforts to mitigate the delay on a schedule.", "Further, neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted the new preliminary schedule or finance responsibility associated with these delays. Once the final revised schedule on cost estimate has been negotiated, we will be able to quantify owner's costs and escalation based upon the revised in-service dates.", "Filing for a new order under the Base Load Review Act will be required if the scheduled in-service date exceeds the current 18-month contingency, which would be September 2018 for Unit 2 and/or as a change in the project costs. Once we have negotiated a finalized revised schedule and cost estimate, SCE&G if required will file a petition requesting a new order with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Should SCE&G file a petition, Public Service Commission would have 6 months to issue its order.", "SCE&G provided its annual update on the progress of new nuclear units to the Public Service Commission and allow ex parte briefing held on October 15. I also wanna mention that last week, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion unanimously affirming the November 2012 decision of the Public Service Commission, which authorized SCE&G to modify its construction schedule and include $273 million of cost when it's capital cost under the Base Load Review Act.", "I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Please turn to Slide 12. On this slide, you can see an aerial photo of the new nuclear construction site from about 18 months ago, just prior to the first nuclear concrete for Unit 2. I've circled the Unit 2, Unit 3, Cooling Tower 2 Alpha and the containment vessel fabrication area. These are areas we see significant progress by going to Slide 13.", "Slide 13 is an aerial photo from May of this year. You've seen this photo a few times now, but in comparison to where things stood about 18 months ago, you can really see how the project is progressing. Clearly, Cooling Tower 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha are structurally complete with work progressing on the other 2. You also see the lower bowl and structural module CA-20 in place in the Unit 2 nuclear island along with significantly more work in the containment vessel assembly area.", "On Slide 14, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see CA-20, along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. The lower bowl is not covered by the auxiliary building and they are coming up to elevation 100. Elevation 100 must be achieved in order to begin work on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for plant.", "On Slide 15, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 containment vessel Ring 2. This ring is complete and will be set after placement of structural module CA-01 and CA-05.", "Slide 16 shows a schematic of the modules inside the containment vessel. And here, you can see the locations of the previously mentioned module CA-01 and CA-05, which we will further discuss shortly.", "Slide 17 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators, the pressurizer, and forms our fueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 46 of 47 submodules on-site and 18 of those submodules are upright and being assembled in the Module Assembly Building or MAB.", "Slide 18 and 19 show pictures of the Unit 2 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. On Slide 18, you can see module CA-05 being moved outside of the MAB to attempt for the addition of the final wall panel submodules.", "Slide 19 shows module CA-05 inside the tent with the final submodules have been placed and final wells were completed. This module is ready for hook, and we anticipate placing it in the Unit 2 containment vessel by the end of the year.", "Slide 20 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Here, you can see where the containment vessel lower bowl has been placed, and the auxiliary building walls are beginning to take shape.", "Turning to Slide 21, you can see a picture of the unit 2 turbine building. All of the modules have been completed and placed on the turbine building base map and progress has been made on the structural steel for the surrounding turbine building itself. The turbine building is now getting prepared for placement of the turbine rotors and generator, which will go on top of these structural steel modules.", "Slide 22 shows a picture of the turbine building module CH-80 and CH-82 for Unit 3, as they're being assembled outside of the turbine building excavation.", "Slide 23 may look familiar, as you probably remember pictures we have previously shown of the massive Unit 2 Deaerator component being transported to the site. However, this is a new picture of the unit 3 Deaerator, as it crosses interstate 95. This component is now on site.", "Slide 24 shows a Unit 2 shield building panel. We have now received 26 of the 167 panels that will be provided by Newport News Industries for the project. These panels will be welded together and concrete will be poured inside of the panels to create a shield building.", "Slide 25 shows a 3 Unit 2 main transformers and a spare. This component is sometimes referred to as generator step-up transformer or GSU.", "I also want to take a moment to mention Westinghouse's recent acquisition of Mangiarotti in Italy. As you may recall, Mangiarotti manufactures various tanks and heat exchanges that make up parts of the passive cooling design for the AP1000. We believe this acquisition is positive for our project as it gives the Mangiarotti facilities the financial support they need to continue to provide high-quality nuclear components.", "On slide 26, you will see the new nuclear CapEx actual line projected over the life of construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018 as reflected in the August 2014 BLRA quarterly report and does not reflect any of the Consortium's estimated additional costs or scheduled delays.", "As you can see, the next several years of the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand axis. As we stated before, the incremental 5% future acquisition of the new nuclear project from Santee Cooper will not affect these projected BLRA increases.", "Please now turn to Slide 27. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission approved an increase of $66.2 million. The new rates are effective for bills rendered on or after October 30.", "Our BLRA filings for 2014 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And as you can see, in August, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the Commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter 2014. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2014 in November.", "On Slide 28. You'll see a breakout of the total new nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see the product costs as filed in the August 2014 BLRA report. Project costs are currently underrunning the original approval received from the Public Service Commission. As you can see, this change is largely attributable to lower escalation. This, of course, does not include consideration for the negotiations ongoing relative to the new schedule and cost information.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "I have one question in 3 parts, so I won't violate the 2 or more question rule. The first question centers on, is there any update -- I may have missed this, but is there any update with expectations as to when the timing of this negotiation with the construction Consortium may end? You guys have any idea?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Jim, this is Steve. What we've said a few minutes ago was that we can't predict when those negotiations will be concluded. So we started the negotiation process. It's been fruitful to date, and we can't yet determine when they will conclude.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Do you think this is going to be a '14 event or an '15 event? And your best guess.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "My best guess is it could be either.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Turning -- then I think this -- it will be a question now for Jimmy. I was a little bit confused on the earnings release. And I just need some refresher on the marketing businesses. You had a -- what's at the Georgia retail? And what's at the corporation?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. So we've got 2 different divisions of the same legal entity, SCANA Energy. We've got SCANA Energy Marketing, which is the kind of industrial marketing arm that markets to industrial customers across all 3 states of our footprint. Some of their capability is for marketing unused capacity of the Georgia retail marketing business. The other division of that company is the Georgia retail marketing business.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Right. So what drove the that loss in the third quarter? Or the higher loss from this?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. So Jim, it was an intentional kind of a strategic move. They've had a real good year early in the year. The industrial marketing company on the retail marketing side, the other division we've had some gas inventories that were higher than current gas market prices for a while, not higher than our sales price, but higher than the current gas market price. So we took that opportunity to move some of that storage gas out and directed from a cost standpoint to some of the industrial sales. Obviously, not charging those industrial customers at higher costs, but absorbing those losses now, refilling that storage with current market prices to get us in a better position headed into the winter heating season in the retail side.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "I totally understand what's going on there. And the last one, I'm also confused, can you walk me through the revised earning guidance? But more specifically, it's not so much the $3.73, $3.90. If i back out the weather and if I assume the midpoint, that means you're at $3.57 and that would be $0.02 above your internal target, your previous internal targets, so I backed out all the weather. What are we going -- how should we think about earnings growth going forward? Are we going to redefine a base to say 2014 as the year concludes? Or do you think we're going to still keep with this '13 base?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, what our intention each year is to move to a weather normal new year. So last year it was of '13 weather normal in our plan. When we released guidance for '15 in February would be to move to a '14 weather normal.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. so if you go 3 to 6, I guess off that '14, I would've implied $3.62 on the low-end, maybe up to $3.80, $3.90. So we're going to actually look on weather-normalized basis probably as still some good year-over-year comps, is that correct?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, I mean I think you had it pretty accurate before when you say if you take the weather off the midpoint of the $3.70 to $3.90.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "I just want to get a little bit -- I don't know if you can help me out, Southern and you guys started at the same time and they -- and if I'm right, when you guys started, some people thought that you might be the first one to complete. And they, on their call yesterday said that they're still hoping and expect to be done on their original timeline, which is end of 2017. And that their costs estimates have not changed as they've recorded. In the same -- and I'm just trying to understand, as the same projects, same technology, same kind of thing. I guess the contract is different. But why is there such a huge delta between one party and the other? I'm sure you have also done some analysis, you have to have done analysis where you -- we are getting off by nearly 18 months, 24 months. They are still on timeline and our costs on the total project for 18 months, ours is only 55% is like $1 billion higher, I think. So I just want to understand, Jimmy, is what is so different that we are having 2 different results for a project of a similar scope, type, in the same region being built by the same kind of subcontractors and things?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Ashar, this is Steve. Let me try to tackle the question. You said that we started about the same time. We certainly applied for our licenses at the same time, and we're within a couple of months of receiving licenses with Southern getting theirs first. Southern got an early site permit. So some of the on-site construction on the Southern Company project did start before ours did. We did not see the need to apply for the early site permit, so we went straight this -- to the combined operating license route, which we both ended up getting. So they did some preliminary work that we did not do. So there are some minor differences on-site. One, because of the early start they got and two, because the sites are slightly differently hard rock site versus a soft soil site. That being said, they are -- the projects are the same project, building the same things with the same vendors and the same constructor. I can't speak to what they would say relative to their schedule or cost. We know that from the original cost projections, Southern company was higher than us by some 40%, and their contract -- though I haven't seen their contract, my understanding is it is different than ours and different than in ours and as much as it may be more fixed than ours is. So what Southern says is what they've said, and you can glean that from their earnings calls. We're dealing with same Consortium that they're dealing with and we've gotten information on cost and schedule that we've updated you on. So that's about as much as we can say on the Southern project.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay, okay. And then, Jimmy, I guess what is being, I guess troubling to the stock and I guess the sell-side is not getting recovery or I guess that's what the stock kind of envisions is that we will have some hard time getting recovery for this overspend. So if I'm correct, what you said is that in -- by the time this agreement is done and over with, I guess the best time frame we have is end of the year. You will then file immediately with the commission the new cost estimates and timelines. And then the commission would have 6 months from that date. So if you get the January 1, you filed January 1 say. So you will know by June 30 what they have allowed you that increase. And I guess the positive thing to rule is that the Supreme Court in their decision earlier basically verified an earlier commission decision to be allowed to recover that. So it seems like they can go ahead and do that. And if they do that, that should not be then appealed to the courts because I guess we have another precedence where the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the commission's decision. Am I thinking through this correctly?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, Ashar. I think your example of the time frame there is technically accurate. I think a couple times before, when we've been in for revisions in the cost and schedule, I think going from memory, they've actually ruled sooner than their 6 months fairly quickly. So they've not necessarily taken that entire 6 months. They do usually take that 6 months on a regular base rate case, just so that they have the maximum statutory allowance before the new rates go in. But I think what you said there is accurate. I don't see any real issues with that. The Supreme Court did rule in favor of us on the interveners appeal. It was a 5-0 decision by the court. And I think everything else you summarized there is pretty accurate.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of UBS.", "Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "About the owner's cost that you were -- you haven't provided an estimate for. Most of that is labor, am I correct in understanding that?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, I would say the majority of it is probably labor and that's our labor, so these are the folks that we've hired that would now be on the project for a longer period of time because the Consortium was extending it. Some of the other costs would be things like insurance. We have to have builders' risk insurance on the project and if the project is extending, then you have to extend that policy. That will come on the policy. So there are some things that are not labor, but I would say the majority of it is probably labor.", "Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I mean, you haven't provided an estimate of it. Is it because you might file for liquidated damages and you don't want to give away your hand on that or ...", "Stephen A. Byrne", "There are some things in the negotiation process that we don't necessarily want to tip our hand on. Other things would be that you have a hiring plan for your staff and you might adjust that hiring plan if you've got a new plan now that to deal with. So that could impact the owner's costs. So there are some things that we can have an impact on an owner's costs.", "Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "The moving target. And is there a kind of a rule of thumb? I mean, is it a sort of a similar magnitude to what their costs are? Is it maybe 30% of it, 20% of it? I don't know.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "I've never done a ratio on the costs. So what we'll do is, we'll -- when we negotiate the schedule, we'll evaluate the owner's costs based on the new schedule and then we'll put that information out.", "Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And one other question I had is about the escalation. You said their numbers are based on 2007 without escalation. And is -- just looking at the way escalation is already affected the project, it hasn't really been much of the problem, right? Especially coming a lot less than expected, so is that sort of...", "Stephen A. Byrne", "To date, it's certainly the escalation has come in much less than anticipated because we had to forecast what the escalation was under that Base Load Review Act at the beginning of the process, and it has been very favorable for a large capital-intensive project. I don't know that I would want to predict what that's going to do going forward, but we didn't apply the escalation just because escalation numbers can swing fairly widely. And they've given us a relatively large range for completion. So obviously, we're trying to negotiate towards the front end of their range. And but where we end up will have an impact on the escalation. That's one reason why we're waiting on the escalation calculations.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "And let me just add, process wise, the escalation is allowed for in the wall, and the escalation kind of is what is up or down it's -- so that's not a separate application if that changes.", "Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Is there any way to estimate what the number would be with escalation I guess in 2014 dollars?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Well, we've got to know all the details of what year and quarters, et cetera, those buckets fall in and we're not to that point yet.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Travis Miller of MorningStar.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Question on the weather benefit that you got in this year. Is that going to impact at all the need for the equity? I know you guys kept it the same or shifted a little bit. It's been a -- the weather has been a pretty nice benefit for you guys. Is that going to affect next year's equity plan at all?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes, Travis, on the margin, it fact, that affects just a little. But more than that, it's just the timing of the construction on the project. So the weather, year-to-date, has been ballpark $50 million pretax, ballpark $30 million after tax or so. So it's not a huge driver of timing of equity. When you got a $1.8 billion liquidity line, $30 million is not a huge swing in there.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay. And then on the $0.29 year-to-date you've gotten on that electric margin, can you break that down in terms of nuclear project, customer growth, other stuff?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. Just a minute, I may have some more on that. Yes, so we talked about -- see, $0.23 is weather, and then the BLRA has added about $0.20, I believe it is. Isn't?", "Susan Wright", "$0.29.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "$0.29, excuse me. The BLRA is added about $0.20 and then residential and commercial customer growth is about $0.06 is the other driver where we're got 1.3% customer growth.", "Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then the other would be, then the other 3 would just be other stuff?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. Just the miscellaneous. Usage, et cetera.", "Operator", "The next question will come Andrew Weisel of Macquarie.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "My first question is, I just want to clarify, I think one of the thing that Ashar was asking about, you're clearly in the process of negotiating who's going to shoulder what portion of the cost overruns between the Consortium and SCANA. But whatever that number ends up being for the SCANA portion, should we think of that as entirely being borne by rate payers or would investors somehow have to share that costs overrun?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes. Under the Base Load Review Act, for it not to be the responsibility of the ratepayers, they would have to be able to prove imprudence on the part of the utility. And certainly, we don't think that there's any imprudence on our part. So we don't think that, that would be any different.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. Second question about the updated schedule. Again, I know that there are certain negotiations you're doing in terms of ways to shorten the delay. But the way that the Consortium has proposed the updated schedule on cost estimates to you is more the increase coming in the near term like '15 or so? Or is it more -- is the additional costs coming more in the other years like 2018 or potentially 2019?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "The additional costs that the Consortium would propose would really be spread out over the project. Now the project is going to spread out for a little bit longer. But I don't think the bulk of the costs will be in '14. I think the bulk of the costs, as you can see from one of the slides we presented it's going to be in '15, '16 range. But it's spread out over the entire contract period.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. And then just to clarify, you were talking earlier about some of those expenses being in labor and insurance type of buckets. Would those ultimately be added to the rate base once the project is done?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, they'd be a part of the capital project and would go in the rate base when the project is finished.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "So they get layered in each year as we would file the BLRA increases just like they do today. Steve has, I don't know, 500 or so SCE&G employees on site now, that he's already hired ramping up for training once the plant comes online. And they go into the BLRA through CWIP each May when we make the filing and into new rates each November.", "Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research", "Great. And my last question is, in light of the favorable trends in terms of weather help this year, your account growth remained strong, what are your latest thoughts on when you might next need to file for a general rate case in South Carolina?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes. Well, our strategy remains to stay out of any kind of general rate increase during this peak nuclear construction years. And the key to that, obviously, is maintaining a reasonable return on the base electric business. We continue to do that. We continue to run it at about a 10% return on equity, as it was in our prepared comments earlier. So we're comfortable with that for the near term.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins", "I had a little -- some questions around the schedule, in particular, the CA -- Unit 2 CA-01 unit. I just wondered if you give a little more color. I know you mentioned you have 46 or 47 submodules on-site. Do you need to have -- what's the anticipated, for the last submodule, is that necessary before you can move forward? Or how should we think about the timing of that CA-01 since it seems like that's critical path item that's holding up a lot of other steps. Is that correct?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, Dan, the CA-01 is a critical module. The 47 submodules that comprise that come in from the Lake Charles facility by truck. And then we will make any kind of inspections from repairs on them on site, infield, then we erect them on a platform inside our Module Assembly Building. And as I think I said a while ago, we got about 16 of those or 18 of those standing on the plant, what the craft are doing now is there's fitting them up, making sure they're intolerant and they're stating the welding process. So as of right now, we have a backlog in the Module Assembly Building, which means they've got more modules that they could stand up. So that's good, they're not waiting on anything. So the absence of that one module isn't holding us up from doing the work. And we anticipate getting that last module sometime in the next couple of weeks. So it in and of itself is not going to be a holdup. And then they -- we -- they ought to progress towards completing that module. And our term is ready for hook, which means it's ready to be placed on the hook of Heavy Lift Derrick. So it basically means that the module is finished to that point where it can be picked up. We're anticipating that sometime in the first half of next year.", "Dan Jenkins", "The first half of '15 for CA-01 to go into the unit, is that what you're saying? Just to be clear.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes, into the containment vessel. So we basically -- we've got, on the structural module site, there are really 6 large structural modules, CA-01 through 05, and they all go inside of the containment vessel, and then the CA-20 goes outside the containment vessel, but still on the nuclear island on the base mat and forms a portion of auxillary building. The CA-20 module has been set. The CA-04 module has been set. The CA-05 module is complete, ready to be set. And so we'll do that shortly before the end of this year. CA-01 is in progress, inside the Module Assembly Building and we anticipate setting that sometime first half of next year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Wondered if you could give an update of what you're seeing at the Sanmen project in China in terms of the overall progress, lessons learned, sort of key execution risks that you see at that site?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes. I think the progress at the Sanmen site has been very good. If you haven't seen pictures of it, I know they've got a photo on Westinghouse's website of Sanmen unit from, I think, it was May of this year. From our look at it, they continue to be about 2 to 2.5 years ahead of us. We've said that from the start. That continues to hold. If you look at the pictures of the Sanmen site, both Unit 1 and unit 2 are coming along. Unit 1 looks like it's about finished. We -- their issues or their holes are probably the same kind of things that we're following. The reactor coolant pumps, squib valves, and we've gotten some good news from the Consortium on both of those fronts just recently. But they've got testing to go through, which they're into now. But they anticipate that they will be starting up those units. I think their goal was to try to do it by the end of '15, first part of '16. So they continue to be 2 to 2.5 years ahead of us.", "Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And from an overall sort of standards of engineering and sort of quality control as you look at that and what you're seeing there, what's your general assessment of that?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Our general assessment of their quality is good. They are building it to Western standards. They don't have the same kind of regulatory oversight that we would have from our Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But that aside, we think that the quality of construction over there is good. They are using some indigenous suppliers, particularly on the secondary side of the plant or the turbine building side of the plant. So that's where they're going to vary from us. So whereas we would you use Toshiba for the turbine and generator, for example, they might use somebody else. Some of the cabling and things are going to try and use indigenous Chinese suppliers that we wouldn't necessarily want to use. So there are going to be some differences particularly on the secondary side of the plant. But the plant is coming right along.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just coming back to the summer project. I want to make sure I understand somethings and I'm trying to get my arm around on something. So the $660 million, that's in '07 dollars that I could use a very low inflation number or escalation number to think about what that -- 1% or 2% if I want to just back of the envelope to think about what that is in terms of 2014 dollars. Is there a back of the envelope we can use for the owner's cost? Meaning, when you first did the budget for the project and you first talked about it, what percent of total cost did owner's cost make up? I'm just trying to think about back of the envelope way to prorate this.", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Michael, off the top of my head, I don't remember what the total amount of the project cost was owner's cost. It was probably less than 10% of the total cost. We can probably got some refinements for you and give you a call back with that number. But I don't have it at my fingertips. But it was not a huge portion of the total cost.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Steve, let me just interject. That's available from the public data mine or is on website and the PSCs in our filing, it shows up broken down.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "In the latest BLRA or in the original one?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "No, it's in the original. I'm not sure if it's in each quarter or not. But we'll have IR follow up with you on that on where it's available publicly.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And is it just safe to assume that the owner's cost would escalate at kind of the same rate, if I took the $660 million and divided it by the last projected cost and then took whatever the owner's costs was and the escalated at the same amount? Is that kind of a rough way to get to what the potential cost increase would be?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "I don't know that you can exactly do that. Some of the $660 million that the Consortium has given to us, they are truly rebaselining things. So they're looking at the experience that they've gained to date on things like module fabrication, on-site efficiencies, engineering completion, those kinds of things. So the owner's cost wouldn't follow that necessarily. A good majority of owner's cost is just because the staff that we've hired are going to be on site for a longer period of time. And then there are some other things, like I discussed insurance, we'll have some increased regulatory commission fees, those kind of things. But the bulk of it is going to be with the people that are there for longer periods of time. And we're looking at things that we can do now, perhaps we don't need that staff quite as early with whatever is the new schedule that we negotiate. We may take some actions to kind of delay some of that hiring. So we have -- we will have some impact on the cost.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then 1 or 2 just kind of more modeling related items to me at least you all talked a little bit about, in the corporate, in the gas marketing business description. You also talked about a little bit higher corporate or holding company interest costs. Is there a new debt issuance? Or did you ramp up short-term debt during the quarter at the holding company level?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "No, that is a very, very minor piece of that variance, Michael, so don't get too hung up on that one.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then lastly, going into the end of the year, what's your expectation for O&M for like the fourth quarter? Like you've talked about O&M being up a good bit in '14 over '13. It hasn't quite been up as much as maybe expected it would be, and you've all done a good job managing that. How do you end the year on the O&M line?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "I think the run rate you're seeing to date is a pretty good projection for the fourth quarter based on what we know today.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Meaning kind of a similar year-over-year growth rate that we've seen in the other 3 quarters?", "Stephen A. Byrne", "Yes. We continue to do a better job than our plan in managing that cost. So we're encouraged by that.", "Operator", "And the next question will be a follow-up from Ashar Khan of Visium.", "Ashar Khan", "Jimmy, I think, in response to Jim's question, I just wanted to clarify. So the midpoint is right now is $3.80. And if you take $0.20 off it for the abnormal weather, you get to a $3.60 normalized 2014. And that would be the new start point when you give guidance for the 3% to 6% for '15 and onwards going forward?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Only if that's where we end up at year end. So I'm sure some things will change between now and the earnings at December 31. But that is based upon today. There will be both weather-related changes in Q4 and non-weather-related changes, but we'll evaluate all of that and come out with a new number. So I'm not giving you $3.60 as a base today. No, we will give you a new number in February.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. But you said you base it off normalized earnings, right? Normalized weather earnings, right? Is that correct or there certain other things that you do?", "Jimmy E. Addison", "That is correct, but some other things could change in Q4 that I don't know of today. There could be something that's abnormal, that's unrelated to weather.", "Ashar Khan", "Understood, understood. But right now, the $3.70 to $3.90, the new forecast, that is higher just because of the abnormal weather that you have had. Is that correct? Based on what you're giving us today.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Not totally, but the majority of it is. So look, we're raising it $0.25 and the weather is $0.23 or so of that. So there's $0.02 or $0.03 in there for things we've experienced year-to-date that we're putting into the revised guidance today.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over the Jimmy Addison for his closing comments.", "Jimmy E. Addison", "Yes. First of all, I want to say thanks to everyone, for your patience, for bearing with us today with this technical problem we had. Thank you for hanging with us for a couple of hours here to get through this. I want to tell you, we're pleased with our results through the first 3 quarters, with only a quarter left in the year, and we continue to focus on the new nuclear construction and on operating all of our business in a safe and reliable manner.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, July 30, 2015. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Susan Wright", "Thank you, and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the second quarter of 2015.", "Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.", "During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and related matters, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other investor information directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA\u2019s homepage, there is a yellow box containing links to the new nuclear development and Other Investor Information sections of the website. It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time-to-time may be deemed material information but has not otherwise become public. You can sign up for e-mail alerts under the Investor Relations section of scana.com to notify you when there is a new posting in the nuclear development and/or Other Investor Information sections of the website.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today\u2019s call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on slide two. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. The required Reg G information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Webcasts and Presentations.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks Susan and thank you all for joining us today. I will begin our earnings discussion on slide three. GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the second quarter are mainly attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customers growth. These were partially offset by lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.06 per share resulting from the sale of CGT and expected increases in CapEx related items including interest and share dilution. Note that even though weather had no impact on earnings quarter-over-quarter, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.06 per share in the second quarter of both 2014 and 2015.", "Please turn to slide four. Earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $3.49 per share versus $2.05 in 2014. The improved results are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains from the sales of CGT and SCI and higher electric margins due primarily to Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth.", "Also O&M presented a favorable variance which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for one month. These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather in the first quarter, lower gas margins primarily attributable to $0.09 per share from the sale of CGT and expected increases in CapEx related items including depreciation, interest, property taxes and share dilution. Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.05 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.11 per share year-to-date 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in 2014.", "Slide five shows earnings on a GAAP adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the second quarter of 2015 were $0.63 per share compared to $0.62 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Year-to-date, June earnings were $1.97 per share in 2015 compared to $1.89 per share from the prior year.", "As a reminder, GAAP adjusted weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015.", "Now on slide six, I would like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings were up $0.07 compared to the same period of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. These items were offset by increases in expenses related to our capital program including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Year-to-date earnings were also higher by $0.07 due primarily to the same drivers.", "PSNC Energy\u2019s earnings for the second quarter of 2015 decreased $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to increased O&M and depreciation. For the six-month period ended June 30, earnings were also down $0.01 per share. SCANA Energy, a retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in second quarter earnings of $0.02 per share in 2015 over last year. This was primarily attributable to lower margins resulting from lower residential volumes during the month of April which was normal [ph] than in 2014. Year-to-date earnings were $0.15 per share compared to $0.13 per share in the prior year.", "Additionally, I am pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been approved to serve as the regulated provider for the State of Georgia through August 2017. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program\u2019s inception in 2002.", "On a GAAP basis, SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the prior year. This is mainly attributable to foregone earnings contributions from the city areas that were sold during the first quarter of this year.", "For the six-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.44 in 2015 compared to $0.08 in 2014. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI on $1.41 per share, GAAP adjusted EPS was down $0.05 from the prior year.", "I would now to touch on economic trends in our service territory on slide seven. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $750 million with the expectation of creating over 1,800 jobs in our Carolinas territories. This growth reinforces that the Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment.", "At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolinas unemployment rate is now at 6.6% and the rate in SCE&G\u2019s electric territory is estimated at 6.1%. Approximately 60,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago.", "Slide eight presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see accelerating customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G\u2019s electric business added customers at a year-over-rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.7% and 3% respectively. This is the first time any of our businesses have hit 3% growth since 2008. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015.", "Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.1% on a 12-month ended basis. We continue to see slightly lower weather normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies which is offset by increases in industrial demand. The residential construction decline has been slightly more moderate than we anticipated, but we expect the peak summer months to continue to trend.", "Now please turn to slide nine which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.", "In the block on the right, you will see that SCE&G\u2019s base electric business in which we\u2019re allowed 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended June 30 in the base electric business is approximately 9.5% meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non BLRA related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years.", "We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Continuing down the page on our new nuclear business we\u2019re allowed an 11% return on equity. I wanted to briefly mention that under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will drop to 10.5% for all prospective requests for revised rates under the BLRA beginning in 2016.", "We have had net incremental CWIP over the last year of approximately $547 million and as Steve will discuss shortly, we filed our 2015 request for revised rates back in May.", "Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well and we are allowed a return of equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in the North Carolina and South Carolina respectively and we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns.", "Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the recently filed annual request for revised rates with the public service commission of South Carolina in May. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.", "Now please turn to slide 11 to review our estimated financing plans through 2017. This plan is the same as was presented last quarter. On May 19th of this year, SCE&G issued $500 million of 50-year bonds at 5.1%. Also in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401-(k) and DRIP plans before turning off the plans to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the need of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds and the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. While these are our best estimates on incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes and funding needs for planned project expenses. And we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis.", "Finally on slide 12, we are reaffirming our GAAP adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next three to five years using a base of 2014\u2019s GAAP adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.58.", "As a reminder, our projected effective tax rate for 2015 exclusive of the taxes on the gains on the sales of those subsidiaries remains approximately 31%.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks Jimmy.", "Please turn to slide 13. I would like to begin by again touching base on the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12 this year that is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the two new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2, and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost schedule includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contested costs. Negotiations continue with the Consortium and neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and/or delay-associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved.", "Our hearing with the Public Service Commission took place last week on July 21st and 22nd. The Sierra Club was the only active intervener in the hearing and SCE&G and the Office of Regulatory Staff or ORS were the only parties that presented witness testimony. The ORS, one of the parties who entered into a settlement agreement with SCE&G also presented the terms of the agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than September the 12th. We are hopeful that PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with ORS and South Carolina Energy Users Committee related to the aforementioned petition.", "This settlement agreement signifies that no contested issues exist among settlement parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules. As Jimmy has already mentioned, the settlement parties also agree to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.5% from 11% for calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1 of 2016.", "I\u2019d now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the site from March. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site. And I\u2019ve labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up the construction table top.", "On slide 15, you can see an aerial photo come in different perspective. This angle shows the couple of the parking lots for the construction staff of the new units. And currently there are approximately 3,500 workers at the site. I would like to mention also that we\u2019re having great success of having the permanent staff for the new units. We\u2019ve already hired almost 600 of the anticipated 800 full-time positions that will be needed when the units are on line.", "On slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 Nuclear Island. In this picture, you can see Module CA20 along with containment vessel ring 1 which has been placed on the lower bowl. We continue to make progress with the fabrication and placement containment vessel structural modules.", "Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the five large structural modules that are located inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA01 through 05 gives you a better feel of how they fit spatially inside that containment vessel.", "Slide 18 shows the lift and placement of the Unit 2 module CA01 which took place on July 23rd. The 2.4 million pound CA01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer, and forms a refueling canal inside of the containment vessel. This module is the heaviest lift that will occur during the nuclear construction project. On the top left, you can see one of the module assembly building or MAB walls was removed in order to move the module outside for rigging to heavy lift area. CA01 was then lifted and placed into the Unit 2 containment vessel.", "Slide 19 shows the picture of CA02 which will be the next structural module placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel. All five sub-modules have been assembled in the MAB and CA02 is now structurally complete. Module CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank.", "Fabrication is nearing completion and the containment vessel rings for both units. On slide 20, you can see the fabrication as the Unit 2 containment vessel top head. Once all three containment vessels rings have been placed for Unit 2, this closure head will be placed on top to seal the containment vessel.", "Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the auxiliary building walls continue to take form. Slide 22 shows the June 29th lift and placement of the Unit 3 Module CA04 into the containment vessel lower bowl. Module CA04 is a reactive vessel cavity that will house the reactor.", "Please turn to slide 23. On day prior the placement of CA04, the Unit 3 reactive vessel was received on site. The Unit 3 reactive vessel arrived in the Port of Charleston on June 26, and was transported over the next two days via rail on a specially designed railcar due to the excessive weight of the component. Once the Unit 3 CA04 is fully encased in concrete, this reactor vessel, which houses the fuel assemblies will be lowered into it and mounted on top.", "Slide 24 shows the placement of the first Unit 2 shield building panels. Six of the panels each weighing approximately 33,000 pounds and spanning 40-feet were lifted and placed outside of the containment vessel earlier this month. As the shield building panels are placed and welded together, concrete will be poured inside of the panels to create a shield building.", "On slide 25 you will see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of construction. This chart reflects our company\u2019s current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020. It\u2019s reflected in the annual requests for revised rates with the Public Service Commission.", "As you can see, this year and the next several years are the peak nuclear construction periods. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right hand access.", "Please now turn to slide 26. As you can see, we\u2019ve filed our BLRA quarterly status update for the first quarter of 2015 in May as well as our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. The Office of Regulatory Staff has completed their review of our request and is recommending to the Commission a $64.5 million revenue increase or a rate increase of about 2.6%. We concur with their recommendation and anticipate the requested increase in rates effective for bills rendered on or after October 30th.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Travis Miller at Morningstar.", "Travis Miller", "I was wondering if you could give a lot of more around your thinking on that settlement, why come to settlement, why not go to the hearing, some thoughts around the terms of settlement, general thinking on that. Hello?", "Steve Byrne", "So in the State we are encouraged\u2026", "Travis Miller", "You heard my question. Okay.", "Steve Byrne", "I heard the question, I got the question. So, we\u2019re encouraged entering into settlement agreements. The Office of Regulatory Staff is also encouraged and likes to promote settlement agreements. And so we always try to present a settlement agreement to the Commission whenever we go in for any case. Now, we\u2019re not always completely successful. And in this case, the Office of Regulatory Staff, ourselves and one of the interveners which is the Energy Users Committee entered into that settlement agreement. There were a couple of interveners who did not sign on to the settlement agreement, the Sierra Club which actively participated and then there was one other entity that did not actively participate in the hearing which is not unusual. There are a lot of people that sign on as interveners just to get information; they don\u2019t really participate in the process.", "So from our perspective, it was very positive that we entered into the agreement and we only had one intervener against us in the hearing process. I think what the interveners got out of it was that they are concerned with rates and by lowering the ROE; they had a small reduction in rates over the term of the construction process. And it just made it a much more positive hearing process than we had in the past.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. What do you estimate that rate impact or for you guys an earnings impact from that 50 basis points?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, we are looking at about a $15 million reduction over about a five-year period. So that\u2019s the cumulative rough $15 million.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. And apply only to the rate base effectively that starts from 2016 on?", "Steve Byrne", "Correct, correct, that\u2019s prospective.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. And what if you were to get that money back, that contested money, do you then get the 50 basis points back or would there be any kind of change there?", "Steve Byrne", "No, the agreement is the agreement. If we were to -- I think what you\u2019re talking about is if any of the contested amounts we come to some kind of a settlement and/or a lawsuit and were get\u2026", "Travis Miller", "Yes.", "Steve Byrne", "\u2026to get a refund of some description on some of those costs, we would credit those costs back to customers but it would not impact the settlement agreement.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Byrd", "I just had one question on new nuclear and just curious your take on in China at the Sanmen project, how that project is going, lessons learned, sort of general timeframe as you understand from that and just trying to think about that in the context of sort of paving the way for the U.S.?", "Steve Byrne", "We go to China relatively frequently. We\u2019ve had folks there within the last two months. So, we would like to try to gauge what\u2019s going on the China project. They have been and continue to be about two and half years ahead of us. Now some of their issues are different than our issues. They actually get some issues resolved for us. I would say that my impression now is that critical path for them really is the reactor coolant pumps, getting those installed and getting to their primary side hydros, our functional testing. So, they are pushing on those reactor coolant pumps means that they will not be an issue for us. So, they will be off our critical path. Our best estimate of when they will start up is probably sometime late 2016. So again, they continue to be about two and half years ahead of us.", "Stephen Byrd", "And just broadly with Westinghouse and just watching what some of the issues with Mitsubishi internationally. Any further color you can provide in terms of -- it sounds like the issues that have occurred on cost accounting, [ph] they\u2019ve been really more international, not really U.S. based. But any additional color that you can add based on your conversations?", "Steve Byrne", "The only thing that we could add and I am assuming you\u2019re talking about the Toshiba issues are that we are not aware that our project is involved in any of the cost reporting improprieties. I know that the report that was just recently translated from Japanese to English indicates that there was a project; I think they call it Project G, so they don\u2019t actually identify it but it is a Westinghouse project. We don\u2019t believe that we have that Westinghouse project. And I know that they had irregularities one quarter to the next but it did point that over the year things equaled out. So, we don\u2019t anticipate any adverse actions to our project based on anything that\u2019s going on at Toshiba.", "Stephen Byrd", "Sorry, Toshiba, not Mitsubishi. And Project G; was that indicated to be an American project or it was unclear in terms of how it was disclosed?", "Steve Byrne", "It did not indicate whether it was a U.S. project or where it was, just said Project G.", "Stephen Byrd", "But it sounds like from your perspective, no issues there. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim von Riesemann at Mizuho Securities.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Hey questions for you, if bonus depreciation goes through, what\u2019s the cash flow impact to you guys?", "Jimmy Addison", "It\u2019s by ballpark 75 million a year.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. Would that help albeit the need to have to do any equity in 2017 either under the old plan or the new special petition?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs. ", "Michael Lapides", "I just wanted to check in the BLRA rate increase for November of this year, about $64.5 million; I recall a higher number, the $69 million or so. Was the adjustment just due to the change in ROE or were there other changes as well?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, nothing to do with the ROE. So, the ROE change only impacts revised rate fillings in 2016 and forward, not pretending one. The difference is that we make our following in May but it\u2019s as of the end of June, so we have to project the spending as of the end of June; and then the ORS when they do their work, they true it up to the actual expenditure. So it\u2019s simply just the difference in what we projected versus the actual expenditures.", "Michael Lapides", "And did expenditures through the middle of the year come in lighter than what you would have forecast and do you expect that to be made up on the second half of the year or does that get pushed out to some future year?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, the first part of your question Michael is slightly lighter than we had forecast but it\u2019s really not possible to answer the second part of that; it\u2019s really out of our control; it\u2019s consortium related, so don\u2019t know if it will all be caught up in the second half of the year or trickle over.", "Michael Lapides", "So, there is a shot and you will find out in the course in coming months or so that some of the 2015 CapEx may actually get moved out to later years?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. It could and that\u2019s obviously what\u2019s happened in the past, but at some point the points are going to be finished and it\u2019s got to catch up, right? So I just can\u2019t tell you exactly what bucket that will fall in.", "Michael Lapides", "Totally different, the corporate and other costs in the quarter that\u2019s -- I think it was $0.04. Is that kind of a good run rate to think about and is that all just the holding company debt, the 800 million or so kind of the after tax interest on that or there something else that\u2019s in that?", "Jimmy Addison", "No. It\u2019s mostly the holdco debt. And I\u2019m not sure if the classification you\u2019ve got has the other subsidiaries broken out or not, the smaller ones. But if they are other -- let me see which ones are broken out there. Yes, so we have like the SCANA Energy marketing businesses grouped in that as well, so there is some volatility between -- some cyclical nature to that business too. So you can\u2019t really take one straight run rate, so just the debt would be of the holdco would be probably in the ballpark of $0.08 or so negative per year.", "Michael Lapides", "I\u2019m just looking at slide six. So, you\u2019ve got a separate line for corporate and other.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Michael Lapides", "And so that was $0.04 in the quarter.", "Jimmy Addison", "Right. But what I\u2019m saying is in that the Georgia business is in the line above but the SCANA Energy marketing to the industrial customers is grouped in that line with corporate and other, and there is some cyclical nature to that piece of the business. So, it\u2019s not a flat $0.04 times four. The debt carry itself is probably more than $0.08 range, per year.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at UBS.", "Michael Weinstein", "Hi, guys. It\u2019s Mike Weinstein actually.", "Steve Byrne", "Hello, Mike.", "Michael Weinstein", "A quick question on solar. I know you guys have a plan to build about 95 megawatts by 2020 under Act 236. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us an update on that and where you think solar in the states going even beyond that act?", "Steve Byrne", "We think that we are going to be on target for the build out under that Act 236 which is going to call for roughly 45ish megawatts of utility-scale solar and then another 45ish megawatts of non-utility-scale solar. So that\u2019s really aimed at rooftop or community solar. So the process is continuing. We\u2019ve had a number of filings with our State Public Service Commission relative to distributor to energy resources and net metering and we\u2019ve gotten some orders out; we expect another one the process I think it\u2019s in -- we expect it in the July or August. So it\u2019s moving. We are continuing with our plans. We\u2019ve got two solar, utility scale solar that we intend to construct, hopefully we will make some good ground before the end of the year, one of them here at our corporate campus on the order of 4 megawatts and then we got about 500-kilowatt system going to going down near the Charleston area. We do have a number of requests for interconnection to our system from solar generators. So, I would imagine that we will far exceed the 90 megawatts by 2020 but just won\u2019t fall under that Act 236.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins", "I had a question on page eight where you talk about the sales and customer growth, in particular on the industrial sales. It looks still pretty good at 3.8 but I notice that\u2019s the 12-month number. I was wondering if you\u2019ve seen any change in the most recent quarter versus prior quarters, is it any slower, quicker, if you give any color on particular industries as well.", "Steve Byrne", "The industry distribution continues to be fairly spread out among chemicals, paper, metals. The most recent quarter is right upon top -- is right on top of the 12-month average, right at that same number, 3.75%.[Ph]", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. So, you haven\u2019t seen any slowing -- just some other utilities they\u2019re seeing a little slowing in industrial, but you haven\u2019t seen that in your territory.", "Steve Byrne", "We have; we\u2019ve had quite the history of industrial announcements here in the State. The governor has made it a platform of hers and she has been very aggressive about it. And we\u2019ve got several that have been announced that are yet to really put jobs on the ground and the most recent was expected 2500 jobs in the next two to three years. So, we\u2019ve got some of those things that are still coming around from announcements one, two, three years ago.", "Dan Jenkins", "Then a couple of questions just on the new nuclear build. I think I heard you say the next big modules to places, the CA02 is that correct? And if so, when\u2026", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Dan that\u2019s right.", "Dan Jenkins", "Is that going to be a third quarter event or later than that?", "Jimmy Addison", "We would anticipate that will be a third quarter event.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. Are there any other key third quarter items besides the CA02 in the critical path?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, we\u2019ve placed the first of our shield building modules and so we would hope to continue to place more shield building modules but we once we get in the first course of the shield building as a relatively short course. And as you can see from the photographs, it\u2019s about 3-foot panel section. So, we\u2019ve placed a number of those sections now; we\u2019re fitting them up; we\u2019re going to start welding on those probably within a week. Once we get those welded, we will be in a position to do our first concrete pour, that will be short lift because it has less than 3 feet. And then we\u2019ll start that with taller panel. So the panels from here are going to be either 8-foot or 10-foot tall. So, we\u2019ve got different height panels. But this first course which is the short course and then we\u2019ll go up vertically from there. So we\u2019ll make some progress on the shield building.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. How about for Unit 3, what\u2019s next -- kind of next in the queue for it?", "Jimmy Addison", "Unit 3, there will be some -- we\u2019ve got some concrete pours, both outside and inside of the containment vessel. So, you probably saw a release that we set the CA04 module on Unit 3 earlier this year, that module is kind of sleeve if you will, for the reactive vessel. The concrete pours will go around that and you try to balance the inside containment with the outside containment concrete pours and so it become enough of those. We continue to make progress on the walls and we\u2019re going to be focusing same on the turbine building. We\u2019ve completed the base map pour for turbine building. We\u2019ve got some large structural steel modules that we got assembled outside of the excavation that will be fine into the excavation, putting them on the concrete basement. So, you\u2019ll see some turbine building as well as some nuclear island progress on Unit 3.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "We also should be finishing up on the cooling towers. Three of the four cooling towers are structurally complete; fourth one is probably 25% along. So I would imagine we\u2019ll be making good headway on that last cooling tower.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you. In closing, we\u2019re very pleased with our mid-year results as we continue to hit our plan. We continue to make large strides with our new nuclear construction and are diligently working with the regulators to obtain approval of our new construction and cost schedules.

(NYSE:SCG) Q3 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call October 29, 2015  3:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Susan Wright - Director, Financial Planning and IR", "Jimmy Addison - Chief Financial Officer", "Steve Byrne - Chief Operating Officer, SCE&G", "Kevin Marsh - Chief Executive Officer", "Analysts", "Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital", "Julien Dumoulin Smith - UBS", "Jim von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities", "Travis Miller - Morningstar", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Feliks Kerman - Visium Asset Management", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Mitchell Moss - Lord, Abbett", "David Fishman - Goldman Sachs", "Operator", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, October 29, 2015. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Susan Wright", "Thank you, and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2015 and earlier in the week we released an update on our settlement with the Consortium regarding disputes on our new nuclear project.", "Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer; Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G; and Kevin Marsh, our CEO. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, Steve will provide an update of our new nuclear project and Kevin will cover the key points of our settlement. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other investor information directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA\u2019s homepage, there is a yellow box containing links to the new nuclear development and Other Investor Information sections of the website.", "It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time-to-time maybe deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. You can sign-up for e-mail alerts under the Investor Relations section of scana.com to notify you when there is a new posting in the nuclear development and/or Other Investor Information sections of the website.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that maybe made during today\u2019s call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on slide two. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Webcasts and Presentations.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin our call by thanking those of you who reached out to us during the historic rainfall and flooding that hit South Carolina earlier this month. It was and continues to be a trying time for our state and we appreciate your thoughts and prayers as things continued to progress.", "While our systems was restored very quickly, property damage of the citizens of South Carolina will take a long time to restore and tragically several lives were lost and families altered forever.", "Now on slide three, we will begin our earnings discussion. GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were a $1.04 per share, compared to a $1.01 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the third quarter are mainly attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as lower depreciation expense, as I will discuss shortly.", "These were partially offset by lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.06 per share, resulting from the sale of CGT and increases in O&M expense and expected increases in CapEx related items included -- including interest and share dilution. Note that abnormal weather contributed $0.11 per share and $0.07 per share of additional electric margin in the third quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively.", "SCE&G periodically conducts depreciation studies related to electric plant to better determine the proper annual depreciation accrual rates. A new depreciation study performed earlier this year resulted in the adoption of depreciation rates, which produced an annual decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $29 million.", "The PSC authorized SCE&G to implement the new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2015, and at the company's request, the retroactive $14.5 credit from the application of the new rates from January through June of this year has been used to offset a portion of the deferred fuel balance related to its retail electric operations. For the third quarter of 2015 and all subsequent periods the incremental reduction to depreciation expense will flow through income.", "Now please turn to slide four. Earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $4.53 per share versus $3.06 in 2014. The improved results are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as lower depreciation expense as described earlier.", "These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather from the first quarter, lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.15 per share resulting from the sale of CGT and increase in O&M expense and expected increases in CapEx related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution.", "Although, electric margins reflected a negative $0.01 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.22 per share year-to-date 2015, compared to $0.23 per share in 2014.", "Slide five shows earnings on a GAAP adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were $0.93 per share, compared to $0.94 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Year-to-date, September earnings were $2.90 per share in 2015, compared to $2.83 per share in the prior year.", "As a reminder, GAAP adjusted weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015.", "Based upon our results to-date and our expectations for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2015 GAAP adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share.", "Now on slide six, I would like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings were up $0.06 compared to the same period of 2014.", "Increases in earnings were due primarily weather, the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. The application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates also positively contribute to earnings for the quarter.", "These items were offset by increases in O&M expenses and expenses related to our capital program including interest expense and share dilution. Year-to-date earnings were higher by $0.13 due primarily to the same drivers as the quarter with the exception of weather.", "PSNC Energy\u2019s reported a seasonal loss of $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2015, compared to a loss of $0.02 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to increased O&M, depreciation and property taxes, partially offset by customer growth. Year-to-date, 2015 earnings are $0.21 per share, compared to $0.23 per share in the prior year.", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in third quarter earnings of $0.01 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year, primarily due to increased O&M.", "For the nine-month period ended September 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share. On a GAAP basis, SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2015 consistent with the prior year.", "Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins in our marketing business were primarily offset by foregoing earnings contributions from subsidiaries that were sold during the first quarter of this year.", "For the nine-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.37 in 2015, compared to $0.02 in 2014. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of a $1.41 per share, GAAP adjusted weather-normalized EPS was down $0.06 from the prior year, again due to foregoing earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year.", "I would now to touch on economic trends in our service territory on slide seven. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over a $1 billion with the expectation of creating over 3,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We are excited by the continues growth in our service territories as Carolina continued to seen as a favorable business environment.", "At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolinas unemployment rate is now at 5.7% and the rate in SCE&G\u2019s electric territory is estimated at 5.3%. Of particular interest and attesting to our states strong economic growth approximately 80,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago.", "Slide eight presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G\u2019s electric business added customers at a year-over-rate of 1.6%.", "Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at an accelerated rate of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region.", "The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.7% on a 12-month ended basis.", "We continue to be encouraged by the strong industrial expansion that has in turn led to strong sales growth not only in the industrial sector, but also in the residential and commercial markets.", "Now please turn to slide nine which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As denoted in two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business.", "In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G\u2019s base electric business in which we allotted 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for 12 months ended September 30 in the base electric business is approximately 9.7%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years.", "We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continue to perform well. We are allowed to return on equity at 10.25% and 10.6% in South and North Carolina respectively.", "Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect our most current CapEx projections for 2016 and \u201817 and is now inclusive of our 2018 estimates. This forecast also reflects the company\u2019s current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 including an estimate of the impact of the settlement with the consortium, which Kevin will address later.", "At the bottom of the slide, we recapped the estimated new nuclear equip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods of which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.", "Now please turn to slide 11 to review our updated estimated financing plans through 2018. As a reminder, on May 19th of this year, SCE&G issued $500 million of 50-year bonds at 5.1%. Also in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401k and drill plans before turning off the plans to new shares.", "By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plants, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017 and will turn back on the 401k and drill plans to satisfy those needs.", "On the debt side and based upon cash flows and planned construction payments to date, we have deferred $325 million of Q4 planned debt issuances and accelerated some issuances from the out years to better align with our expected funding needs. This plan also anticipates debt to be issued at PSNC to fund its anticipated CapEx spending.", "While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses and will continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis.", "Now I\u2019d like to discuss our 2016 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on slide 12. Our 2016 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized preliminary earnings guidance is $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share and our internal target is $4 per share. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in the first quarter, approximately 25% in each of the third and fourth quarters and the remaining 20% in the second quarter.", "In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of a base rate increase from our new nuclear filing under the BLRA, the accretive impact of the sales of CGT and SCI and our view of their economy. This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier.", "We forecast electric customer growth to be at approximately 1.5% offsetting our assumption that customer average use of electricity will be slightly lower in 2016. We anticipate overall weather normalized retail and electric sales growth for 2016 to decline by approximately 0.2%.", "We expect operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 2% higher in 2016 than where we project to finish for the end of 2015. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx related cost, property taxes, depreciation and interest.", "For the remainder of 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains on the sales of the subsidiaries and looking out into 2016, we projected an effective tax rate of approximately 32%. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view and are reaffirming GAAP-adjusted weather normalized average annual growth guidance as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the three to five years using a base of 2014\u2019s GAAP-adjusted weather normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. Hopefully, this will provide you with some clarity of our view of 2016 as you update your models.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks Jimmy. I\u2019d like to begin by addressing the impact that the recent rainfall and flooding at South Carolina had on the new nuclear construction project. As you\u2019ve probably already seen on our website, we estimate that this weather event resulted in a loss of about four days of work effort.", "I wanted to clarify that the construction schedule has a contingency for weather delays and other events, so that missed day should not impact planned in-service dates for the new units. We have had very little weather impact to date which is why this event should not have an impact on the project.", "Please turn to slide 13. I\u2019d now like to address the public service commission of South Carolina\u2019s unanimous approval for the petition that SCE&G filed in March of this year seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the two new nuclear units. The approval of the petition along with the settlement agreement entered into with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and South Carolina Energy Users Committee adjusted the commission approved, substantial completion dates to June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June 2020 for Unit 3.", "This agreement also allowed for the inclusion of incremental capital cost that totaled $698 million and revised the allowed return on equity to 10.5% from 11% for calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1 of 2016.", "Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the site from June. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site. And I\u2019ve labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up what we call the construction table top.", "On slide 15, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 Nuclear Island and this picture you can see module CA20 on the left side of the slide along with the containment vessel first ring which has been placed on and welded to the lower bowl. If you look through the personnel and equipment hatch openings in the containment vessel ring, you can see super structure of module CA01, which as you recall was placed back in July. We continue to make progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessels, structure and modules.", "Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the five large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA01 through 05 gives you a better feel for how they fit spatially inside said containment vessel. As you may know, we have now placed CA01, CA04 and CA05 for Unit 2.", "Slide 17 shows a picture of CA02 which will be the next structure of module placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel. Module CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment for filling water storage tank. As you see here, all five sub-modules have been assembled and CA02 is now structurally complete and has been moved outside of the Module Assembly Building or MAB. This module is scheduled to be placed sometime in the first half of 2016.", "Slide 18 shows a picture of CA03 which is the west wall of the in-containment we\u2019re filling water storage tank. Four of CA03\u2019s 17 sub modules are on site and three have been fabricated in the MAB.", "Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. Module CA04 was placed inside of the containment vessel lower bowl back in June and the auxiliary building walls as you can see continue to take form.", "Slide 20 shows an aerial view of the low profile cooling towers from June. Three of the four cooling towers are now structurally complete with the fourth, 2 Bravo shown on the slide -- sorry -- showed on the slide 21 being about 50% complete.", "Please now turn to slide 22. Here you can see the placement of the concrete foundation for Unit 2 Turbine Building first bay. The 6-foot thick base mat took 27 hours to pour and consisted of 2100 cubic yards of concrete. This first bay is the transition from the aux building to the turbine building.", "Slide 23 shows the completed Unit 2 transformer base. These transformer base are constructed with reinforcing bar and concrete and serve as a firewall partially in closing transformers. These nine transformer base for Unit 2 were completed during August.", "Components continue to arrive on site. On slide 24, you can see some pictures of the Unit 3-Pressurizer arriving in the Port of Charleston. It was then transferred via rail car to the site. The pressurizer will be hard inside the containment vessel and will be used to control the pressure and react to coolant system.", "Please now turn to slide 25. As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for advised rates under the BLRA in May. In response to their request in September, the PSC approved an increase of $64.5 million. The new rates are reflected for bills rendered on or after October 30th.", "Our BLRA filings for 2015 are shown at the bottom of the slide and as you can see in August, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and the office of regulatory staff for the second quarter of 2015. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter in November.", "I will now turn the call over to Kevin.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks Steve. I\u2019m glad to be with you today to provide some details in connection with our amendment to the EPC agreement for the new AP1000 units at the VC Summer site we announced earlier this week. A number of the key points are summarized on slide 26.", "As you know, these plants were being constructed under an EPC agreement with consortium of Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge and Iron Subsidaries, Stone & Webster. Westinghouse has announced that it intends to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I. Following that acquisition, Stone & Webster will continue to be a party to the EPC agreement but as a subsidiary of Westinghouse instead of CB&I.", "The amendment to the EPC agreement allows CB&I to exit as guarantee obligation for the project. Obligations under the EPC agreement are joined and several obligations of Westinghouse and Stone &Webster. In the October 2015, amendment provides for Toshiba Corporation, the parent company of Westinghouse, to reaffirm it's a guarantee of the Westinghouse payment obligation.", "In exchange for the relief of the CB&I guarantee, the amendment of the EPC contract and an option to fix project cost, SCE&G, Santee Cooper and Westinghouse have agreed to a full resolution and settlement of substantially all loan claims and disputes outstanding under the EPC agreement.", "Under this amendment, SCE&G has agreed to pay Westinghouse incremental capital cost of approximately $245 million over the $5.247 million approved in the public service commissions\u2019 recent Order Number 2015-661. This along with estimated escalations and AFUDC would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.113 billion.", "The amendment also revises the guarantee to central completion dates of units two and three through August, 31, through 2019 and 2020 respectively. SCE&G share of liquidated damages would increase from $86 million to $509 million. The new liquidated damages are tied to the new guaranteed substantial completion dates and the eligibility of the units to earn federal production tax credits.", "Westinghouse also has opportunity to earn from SCE&G completion bonuses of approximately $303 million or $151.5 million for each unit depending on the timing of the plans being placed into service. In addition, this amendment provides SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper an exclusive and irrevocable option until November 1, 2016, to further amend the EPC", "agreement to fix for total amount remaining to be paid for the entire scope of work on the project after June 30, 2015 at approximately $3.345 billion, which is SCE&G\u2019s 55% portion of $6.082 billion.", "This fixed price option would result in SCE&G\u2019s paying Westinghouse incremental project costs of approximately $774 million over the previous escalated amount approved by the PSC of $6.826 billion. Combined with estimated escalations and AFUDC, this would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.601 billion.", "If the fixed price option is exercised, SCE&G share of a delay related liquidated damages amounts previously referred to would then be capped at approximately $372 million or $186 million per unit. The completion bonus to be paid by SCE&G with this option is approximately $165 billion or $82.5 million each unit depending on the timing of the plants being placed in service.", "Our team worked very hard to include the unilateral fixed price option into this settlement. We will be evaluating the potential benefits of this option over the next several months. If elected, this option would fix all costs of Westinghouse at an approximate 11% increase over the current PSC approved budget.", "We along with our partner, Santee Copper believe this option has significant value. Once final evaluation of this option is complete, we will discuss with the South Carolina office of Regulatory Staff, our conclusion regarding our decision whether to exercise the option and make a filing with the public service commission of South Carolina.", "And important part of the amendment is the development of a new revised construction payment milestone schedule. Over the next five months or until the new payment schedule is agreed upon, SCE&G will make monthly payments of approximately $100 million per month, which our share is $55 million.", "Thereafter, payments will be made to Westinghouse based on construction milestones achieved. After this milestone schedule is agreed upon and if the fixed price option is elected and approved, our CapEx schedule Jimmy reviewed on slide 10 will be updated and our financing schedule will be confirmed as well.", "The amendment also modifies the EPC agreement to explicitly define what constitutes a change in law to reduce the likelihood of certain commercial disputes. A Dispute Resolution Board will be established for resolution of disputes as the requirement or ability to bring suit before substantial completion of the project is then eliminated.", "Finally, I\u2019m excited to have full cooperation involved in the project. Fluor was established in South Carolina and has a deep nuclear pedigree with this nuclear division being headquarter in Greenville, South Carolina. We\u2019ve had a long relationship with Fluor and believe they have an excellent record of delivering on commitments.", "That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Weisel", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys.", "Kevin Marsh", "Hey Andrew.", "Andrew Weisel", "First question is on the option to switch to the fixed costs for the construction. What would be some of the reasons not to do it? You mentioned a lot of benefits. What might be some reasons why you won\u2019t exercise it and when do you think you might make that decision?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, we will make the decision over the next 6 to 12 months. We have 12 months to make the final decision. We want to take some time to let Fluor get acclimated to the project and have them look at the project schedule, the timetable associated with the completion dates and get their opinion combined with our valuation of how they intend to approach the completion of the project. So, we can evaluate the option we are under today, which is to complete the project with the target pricing along with the fixed and firm. Both of the project will have to be done is in that target category, which means we pay the costs that they incur. That\u2019s important to us because when we get their feedback on the achievement of the milestones and what risks we think we may have there. We think we\u2019ve strengthened our risk position there because we\u2019ve increased the LDs on the project significantly. I think at 6 times if we go under the existing option today.", "So, once we get the change to fully evaluate the schedule, the new completion dates along with their oversight and our complete evaluation, I think we will be in a better position to make that decision. We certainly think the fixed price option is very appealing. We work hard to negotiate that option into our settlement because it does give us additional protections for rising cost. Certainly, interest rates and projected escalation rates between now and the time we make that decision will have an impact on which way we might so. But we just need some more time to evaluate that more fully.", "Andrew Weisel", "Okay. But it sounds like you are leaning towards taking that option or is it -- do you seem to take that?", "Kevin Marsh", "No. I wouldn\u2019t make that decision today. I still think it\u2019s very appealing and certainly it gives us a backstop if we weren\u2019t comfortable with the existing option. But I don\u2019t want to leave the impression that we have made that decision today because we want that time to evaluate where the projects going, what we think interest rates might do in the future, what impact that could have on escalation and just the overall time schedule,", "Andrew Weisel", "Got it. Okay. Next question is my understanding is that so far your payment schedule hasn\u2019t really been based on the completion of milestones, so you need to have a true-up of what\u2019s been paid so far. Are you expecting to be ahead or behind? In other words, are you expecting to get some cash back from cost over today?", "Kevin Marsh", "We are certainly ahead on the schedule because that was one of the things that drove but it was behind many of the speeds on the project that we resolved with this amendment. In the original agreement, there were two types of payments we made. Some of those were based on time, just passing the timetable on the schedule and others were based on actual work done. That got to be fairly contentious because we felt like, in some circumstances we were being billed for work that was not being completed, consistently with the schedule we had agreed to in the original contract.", "What this amendment does is it resolves those differences. So everything that\u2019s being paid today is, I think I\u2019m confident saying that was below -- it's actually been performing on the project. We are certainly not ahead of schedule. So what we will do is we are going to work with Westinghouse in Fluor very carefully to come up with a new construction payment milestone schedule. We will take about five months to do that.", "We\u2019ve estimated during that time. On a 100% basis, we will be paying $100 million per month and then at the end of six months that will be trued-up. So it won\u2019t be ahead or behind at that point. And then from that point on, once we agree to the schedule, payments will be made as milestones are achieved and that will be very simply. If the works done they will be paid. If the works not done in accordance with the schedule regardless how much time has passed, there won\u2019t be a payment required from us.", "Jimmy Addison", "So that $100 million is 100% basis, so our 55% share will be $55 million.", "Andrew Weisel", "That\u2019s right. Thanks Steve. Okay. And all of that is embedded in the financing slide you showed through 2018?", "Kevin Marsh", "It is, Andrew. So what we did in updating that schedule is simply took the formula that Kevin and Steve just alluded to and recast the first seven months according to that basis and then the next five months of 2016, we will just use an estimate of what we had there, existing. So, we have at least improved for what we know for those first five to seven months and we are just going to need to refresh everything once we get to that point where we are ready to take this before the commission and we will refresh our CapEx and financing schedule at that point.", "Andrew Weisel", "Okay. Great. And then just lastly, since we assume that the financing plans being, equity in particular assumes no bonus depreciation and what will that look like if you do have an extension?", "Jimmy Addison", "Bonus depreciation is in the ballpark of $75 million a year. So that\u2019s the value of it to us. And you are right, it does not assume that.", "Andrew Weisel", "Thank you very much.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Julien Dumoulin Smith", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Kevin Marsh", "Good afternoon.", "Julien Dumoulin Smith", "So with the depreciation benefits in earnings now helping you, I supposed and you tell me drive towards close to your authorized ROE, how are you thinking about your earnings growth rate here? Obviously, it\u2019s better than the 3 to 6, just thinking more dramatically here.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah. First of all, we do -- we have historically done and had an informal kind of commitment with the commission to refresh your depreciation rates every five years or so. And that\u2019s simple enough to do and get into the rate process when you have inflation related driven rate case every two, three, four years. Since we have this strategy of staying out of any base rate increases other than the BLRA, we were getting on the outside of that timeframe. So, we refreshed it, went to the commission, ask them to approve it, they did and we\u2019ve implemented that now for 2015 and forward.", "So it is a, kind of a one-time reset if you will. Ultimately, it will all be kind of put back into the whole rate process at some point down the road or after the BLRA is over and the new units are in place. But in the mean time, you can say we might be on the upper edge or slightly outside the band in the very short run. But that guidance is a three to five year intermediate band and not just a one year band. So, I don\u2019t know that that really puts us outside of it, outside of that three to five year band because we reset that every year.", "Julien Dumoulin Smith", "Right. But just to clarify real quickly, in terms of earning your ROE next year, there is no reason why this step-up that you are seeing with the depreciation study that\u2019s a real sustainable benefit occurring to you guys.", "Kevin Marsh", "It is.", "Julien Dumoulin Smith", "Until the next rate case, presumably as you said.", "Kevin Marsh", "That\u2019s right and everything gets reset. But we are comfortable with our strategy of earning in that 9% to 10.25% range on the base electric business for the next three years.", "Julien Dumoulin Smith", "Got it.", "Kevin Marsh", "Based on what we know today obviously.", "Julien Dumoulin Smith", "Right. And then let me cut back to the sales growth expectations, did I hear you right in saying a slight decline next year in the baseline forecast for the '16 guidance and can you expand on why that might be given the year-to-date experience?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, the year-to-date experience is inconsistent with the last two years. If we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to get growth year-over-year for '15 to '16, we would have more upside. And honestly, I hope we experienced that because that\u2019s a great signal of the economy in South Carolina if that\u2019s the case. But at this point, our best modeling says that for the first time there will be almost a wash between the incremental margin from new customers offset by the slight margin decline from all customers due to energy efficiency etcetera.", "And honestly, that\u2019s a good sign for us because as our whole industry has dealt with the last several years the customer growth has been overwhelmed by the efficiency in the decline in average use. So we are glad we are back to be able to project the breakeven and hope we have the challenge that you alluded to because that\u2019s good news for the economy.", "Julien Dumoulin Smith", "Right. And then there is no specific customer class here that you\u2019re highlighting that you would drive that, right?", "Kevin Marsh", "No, but the predominant of it is in the residential commercial classes.", "Julien Dumoulin Smith", "Right, absolutely. All right. Great. Well, thank you.", "Kevin Marsh", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Jim von Riesemann of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Hey, guys, congratulations on a settlement.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thank you, Jim.", "Jim von Riesemann", "I just wanted to follow up on some of the Julien\u2019s questions. How much is the depreciation affects post the impact fourth quarter earnings?", "Jimmy Addison", "Jim, it\u2019s about a $0.03 per quarter run rate, so $0.12 a year.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. And then, so I guess the follow-up question to that is, your trailing 12 is what 365, 366 and your internal midpoint before was 370 on a weather normalized basis. Do you expect to hit that number?", "Jimmy Addison", "Do we expect to hit which number?", "Jim von Riesemann", "The 370 number, your internal target number?", "Jimmy Addison", "We do.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. Secondly, switching over to the settlement, are the bonus payments included in the capital cost, are those incremental?", "Jimmy Addison", "They would be incremental, Jim. They are not included in the base costs we disclosed in the amendment.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Are those shareholders born or customer born?", "Jimmy Addison", "That has not been determined. They will be before the commission and have a chance to explain both of these options and then which one we choose to go with. Since we don\u2019t know exactly whether or not those will be paid out or what amounts it might be paid out in for one or both things because it\u2019s done on a per unit basis. We can\u2019t exactly determine if it\u2019s going to be paid.", "We would like to have these projects completed on time and have that a nice problem to have. We will address that with the commission, unlikely to ask commission how we proceed that and my recommendation would be we wait till the end of the project to see where the final cost comes in. So that\u2019s most likely recommendation to the commission since we can\u2019t determine exactly what that would be today and that might be influenced by which option we take too.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Have you guys chat with the rating agencies yet?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes.", "Jim von Riesemann", "What was the response?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, those not published anything yet, I expect they will in the near term, but just to characterize the oral discussions I think it was generally neutral deposit with each of the agencies.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. Can you just talk about? And then lastly, could you talk about how the risk get rebucketed from under this settlement, I mean obviously you\u2019ve absorbed some of your own risk that you bought, but how much -- what sort of risk would you say that you still retain and the risk that the construction consortium retains?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, I would say our risk profile under either options is significantly enhanced. And in fact, under the existing option that we\u2019ve resolved all of these outstanding issues eliminates the risk of potential litigations and there was issues in the risk that are just inherent and going through that process over time. And I think the fact that we\u2019ve significantly raised the liquidated damages gives us a lot more protection under the existing contracts arrangement, our liquidity damages are 6 times what they were in the original contract.", "We still bear the risk of potential increased escalation and just increased interest expense during that time on the targeted dollars and the majority dollars to be spent between now and the completion of the project or in that target bucket. But I think when you add all of those together, our risk profile is certainly reduced from where it was before we signed the amendment.", "On the fixed price option that we have in front of us, I think that really enhances our risk profile as we shift that escalation risk back to Westinghouse and our only risk would be changes in law or change orders it might be associated with the project and we still got incentives payable under either option, it would encourage them to complete the units on time. So anything that helps that happen in accordance with the schedule and the guaranteed completion date would lower our risk profile.", "Steve Byrne", "Jim, this is Steve. I would give one amplification to that under either scenario I think we have enhanced our risk profile because where we get into commercial disputes with the consortium today, they largely revolve around the definition of a change in law and they would use the term commercially driven or regulatory driven change and the language around changes that we\u2019ve worked on and incorporate into this agreement significantly restricts what will be allowed as a regulatory driven change. So we certainly improved it from that perspective.", "We also have a contract, the EPC contract, remember that was signed in about 2008, early '08 and that was based on the -- at that time our current revision of the design certification document or DCD which is about 16. We were licensed to Rev 19. So they submitted a couple of revisions between signing it and the final approval. And so that has caused us some commercial issues in the interim and we resolved that with this agreement by updating the contract to DCD Rev 19 which is what we\u2019re licensed to.", "Kevin Marsh", "And Jim so I will get a pitch in on this and one other from a financial perspective. And under the old agreement anytime we disputed an invoice, we paid 90% of it as you are aware. Under the new arrangement if we disputed, we don\u2019t pay anything and we get a fairly rapid resolution from a resolution board. So we think that\u2019s a much better situation too to get all the parties to the table and of course there is one less probably to get to the table than it was in the past.", "Jim von Riesemann", "So let me ask like a worse case basis type question, so has Fluor and Westinghouse looked at the quality of work that has been done by CB&I?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, I think that Fluor has not had an opportunity to look at the quality. Fluor will not take over until the deal is effective. There is a period of time for regulatory approvals of the deal, standard stuff, perhaps compete slightly by the fact that Toshiba is a foreign entity. So there are regulatory approvals that need to take place, that\u2019s why we think that that will be about a 45-day window and that\u2019s when Fluor will have their first opportunity to assess things like quality.", "But Westinghouse has had an opportunity to assess quality as of our folks. And so we don\u2019t just rely on the quality from the vendor in this case CB&I. We have our own quality group and own quality inspectors and we send our folks not just at the site, but we will send them to facilities that are manufacturing components whether it would be CB&I or somebody else and we will send them whether it\u2019s domestically or internationally. Our QA, QC inspectors have got a lot of stamps on their passports. So we will be able to assure Fluor of the quality in construction so far.", "Jim von Riesemann", "So you are happy with the quality so there is going to be no aha moment is what you\u2019re saying?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah, we don\u2019t anticipate any aha moment.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Great. Thank you.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thank you, Jim.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Travis Miller", "Thank you. Good afternoon.", "Kevin Marsh", "Hey, Travis.", "Travis Miller", "Just wondering on this regulatory stuff in terms of a settlement. One, how much were regulators involved in this, either the federal level or state level? Was anybody involved and what was that makeup in terms of regulatory involvement?", "Kevin Marsh", "They were not directly involved into negotiations. Certainly we briefed also regulatory staff before we made up the final announcement of the settlement agreement. It was our commitment to the commission when we were in there this year talking about the contract changes and getting approvals at that time from the existing contracts that we would come back to them and let them know of any changes in the status of the project.", "So we expect to be before the commission here in the near future and ex-partake communication which is a quickest way for us to get in front of them and educate them on more of the details of the contractual amendments involved and how the options would work for the company going forward. And of course once we make the final decision, we would be obligated to go back and make that filing to adjust the timetables and the entity -- excuse me and the cost associated with it.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. You answered most of my second question there in terms of the regulatory process there, but is there a chance that regulators could deny the settlement, say, it\u2019s not in customers interest?", "Kevin Marsh", "Certainly they have got that option every time we go in, but our commission has been very supportive of what we\u2019ve done on this project in the past. They view it as critical not just to provide energy to customers of South Carolina, but it\u2019s a key component of our response to the 111(d) Clean Power Plan. So it is critical to not just us but also for our partners Santee Cooper. So we feel like we are within the guidelines of the challenges we put before us to try to complete the project depending on which option we elect.", "We will go back and present our case to the commission as to why we decided to continue down the same path, why we believe it\u2019s the best interest to elect the fixed option and they generally listen to our testimony and evaluated that and made a fair decision. I certainly can\u2019t guarantee that, but I feel like we would do a good job explaining our position to the commission in a way that they could make a very fair valuation of our election.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. And what kind of timeline would that be on?", "Kevin Marsh", "When we make the decision or once we make the filing, they have six months to render a decision. So if we were to make a decision for example to elect the fixed price option in early June next year, they will have to make that decision by early December. So it\u2019s a six month window from start to finish.", "Travis Miller", "Got it. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, sir.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Paul Patterson", "Good afternoon.", "Kevin Marsh", "Hey Paul.", "Paul Patterson", "Does the fixed price option cover all materials and labor or just some of the\u2026?", "Kevin Marsh", "It covers all remaining work to be done under the contract from now or actually from June 15th until completion.", "Paul Patterson", "So it covers everything.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. And then is there any change in your financing expectations or anything as a result of if you did move to the fixed price, things like that?", "Kevin Marsh", "Paul, let me go back and add one thing to my previous answer, it does cover the construction cost. We still have transmission work to be done, but that\u2019s included in the total expected project cost we provided. So those numbers all included then because the transmission is outside of the EPC contract as well as owners cost.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "And on to your next question about financing, no change in our philosophy of 50-50 debt and equity, we just need to get through the process of reassessing with Fluor, making our option choice going to the commission and getting that approval hopefully. And then recasting the payments accordingly and confirm our financing schedule to that.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. And then the -- there is some fabrication discussion of moving the fabrication from Florida to other places, is that affected by the amended agreement?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. Paul, this is Steve. The discussion about our facility in Florida that was fabricating some of the sub-modules, that was going to be the case whether we stayed under the existing contract or go under, either the two options that we\u2019re proposing.", "So there's a facility in Florida and they are moving that work from that facility in Florida back to the Lake Charles facility for the trailing unit. And for the leading unit we\u2019re actually taking those components to our site and we\u2019re finishing the sub-module fabrication there before we found them into the larger modules.", "Paul Patterson", "And why is that, why isn\u2019t being from, what was the reason for the change?", "Steve Byrne", "I think its two things, one it\u2019s that that facility had some commercial issues between themselves and CB&I. And secondly, they had a lot of work to do, things were backing up. They did have some quality issues while they came up speed and we just think we can do it more expeditiously at our site.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. Great. Thanks so much.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Feliks Kerman of Visium Asset Management. Please go ahead.", "Feliks Kerman", "Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter. So this was answered, just wanted to clarify. In our 2016 guidance number, what ROE are we assuming for the base electric business?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. We have been explicit about on ROE, but today we\u2019re at about 9.7% and more comfortable will be in the band of 9% to 10.25% for the next three years based on our assumptions to-date.", "Feliks Kerman", "So is it okay to assume that the next time we follow rate case there would be at the three-year cycle?", "Steve Byrne", "We clearly said our strategy is to not follow base rate increase while we\u2019re during these nuclear peak construction years, so, yes, that is a safe assumption.", "Feliks Kerman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Steve Byrne", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question will comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides", "Hey, guys. Congrats on the arrangement with Westinghouse, Toshiba, et cetera. Sounds like a great deal and look forward to chatting with you about it in more detail at EI. A couple of minor questions, first of all, can you give us an update on how 2015 nuclear CapEx is progressing? I noticed the table didn\u2019t have 2015 numbers on it. Just wanted to see relative to your last disclosure, whether there's been any change to the expected spend this year on the project?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. Michael, we are a little behind our expected spend there, I\u2019d say in the $100 million or so range. I don't know that a lot of that will be made up between obviously, with only a couple months left in the transition going on them, but that\u2019s kind of where we are through the year -- through to-date.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. Okay. So we should bring down our 2015 number a little bit and just assume that\u2019s embedded in either those 2016 to \u201818 timeline or in the last year or so of the project?", "Steve Byrne", "You can in your assumptions, I would tell you that from our basis, it\u2019s in our guidance, both for \u201815 and \u201916.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. Okay. Real quick on the DNA study and the impact, I want to make sure I\u2019m capturing the EPS impact to this correctly. So next year what is the incremental EPS impact in 2016 that you're not going to recognize in 2015?", "Steve Byrne", "About $0.06 will impact 2015 and an incremental $0.06 in 2016 for an aggregate $0.12 and that will be the run rate for \u201816 forward.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. And can you -- I want to make sure I tie that back. In the slide deck it mentions $0.10 in this quarter -- in third quarter, is that just, its not the full $0.10 because of rate credit that was done or the reduction that was done on the deferred fuel balance?", "Steve Byrne", "That\u2019s exactly right. So we did record three quarters worth in 2015 into third quarter because it applied back to January 1st, but the first two quarters went to offset the fuel and so we only got net income impact of one quarter in \u201815 though the Q3 recording.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. Last thing and looking at the CapEx schedule, the utility CapEx in North Carolina, the gas utility there, seems like that a good bit higher when we get out to 2017 and 2018. Can you talk about that, talk about the timing and plans for potential rate case filings? And how you would or are there other mechanisms that can give you rate relief after spending significant capital level there?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. Well, obviously, the low price in natural gas is driven a lot of opportunity for industry for electric generation from gas plants, et cetera, and that is certainly been the case in North Carolina.", "So we\u2019ve had enough lot of opportunities that have popped up. We have executed some contracts in the last quarter or two that have driven this need to enhance some of our existing plants to grow the transmission system, so that was really driving these numbers.", "And clearly, it\u2019s starting to drive down the earned return and so it will drive the need for a rate proceeding at sometime in the near future. We\u2019ve not made any final decisions on that, but I expect we will have someone announcement around that in 2016.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. So maybe a case in '16 implemented in '17 or a case in '17 implemented in '18, kind of somewhere in that time horizon?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. Again, haven\u2019t made any final decisions, but today I would say it\u2019s more likely your first scenario than the second.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.", "Steve Byrne", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Steve Byrne", "Hey, Dan.", "Dan Jenkins", "Just kind of following on Michael\u2019s question there on the CapEx changes. And I was looking at the prior one and it looks like 2016 is up by about $260 million or now about a $120 million and 2017 is up by about a $120 million versus why you had in last quarter slides, is that due to the additional delays? Or is that due to the work not getting done in 2015 is being pushed in 2016? Or how should I think about that?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. Dan, are you talking about the total CapEx because the numbers I have are that we\u2019re up about $60 million for '16 and down about $60 million for '17 overall.", "Dan Jenkins", "I'm looking at the bottom of the total estimated capital expenditures at the bottom.", "Steve Byrne", "We only have about -- sorry, you go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins", "The slide I\u2019m looking at last quarter for '16 estimated at'17 38 and for '17 at 1617.", "Steve Byrne", "That\u2019s not what I have here in front of me. We\u2019ll have to clear that up.", "Dan Jenkins", "This is what I -- I\u2019m just holding up part from the website so\u2026", "Steve Byrne", "Let me give you a little color on what we have changed. So we\u2019ve made the best estimate we can on the nuclear as I described earlier for 2016 based upon the revised agreement. The other thing we've done is there are reductions in the SCE&G base electric business, just based upon our commitment to scrub the CapEx for that business and try to avoid any base electric rate increases.", "The other significant change is adding the CapEx to the North Carolina gas system PSNC Energy and so we added about 75 in '16 and 46 in '17 for PSNC. So those are the three large changes. For '16, 135 down in electric, 53 -- 75 up at PSNC and 115 up in nuclear.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. Then on a question on slide eight on the sales and customer growth.", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah.", "Dan Jenkins", "And again looking at last quarter\u2019s release, I realized these are 12 -- I\u2019m looking at the table at the bottom for kilowatt hours, the last I realize this is 12 months ending numbers but there are big changes and why they\u2019re normalized so that the residential went from basically negative 30 basis points to a positive 170 and commercial from positive 30 to positive 140. And then conversely, the industrial went from 3.8% to under 2.3%. So are you seeing that kind of big changes from quarter-to-quarter? And can you give me some more color on what's going on in the demand from the various customer segments?", "Steve Byrne", "We are seeing that kind of change from quarter-to-quarter. And I would tell you that it probably has more to do with the slide before that on the economy than anything else in our opinion. Let me give you a little more depth on that. So as I said in my earlier prepared comments, there are 80,000 more South Carolinians working today than they were a year ago.", "The unemployment rate has dropped from 6.6 to 5.7, but that only tells part of the story. The workforce has expanded 3%. So if the workforce were the same level today than it were a year ago, the unemployment rate would be less than 3% in South Carolina. So the industrial recruitment in the state has been a real homerun. Our governor has made that central to a platform and she has been extremely successful.", "And we\u2019ve seen it in the RNC markets as a result of that. Now contrast that to North Carolina where the workforce is expanded 1.8% contrasted to Georgia where it\u2019s actually slightly down almost breakeven year-over-year. The South Carolina is really growing.", "Dan Jenkins", "I guess kind of the concern though is the big slowdown in the industrial sector and what that might being going forward, do you have any color down as to why that drop so much?", "Steve Byrne", "I don\u2019t have any specific, no large closings or anything like that that has driven that I\u2019m aware of. I\u2019m not too concerned about that in the short run. I know the pipeline of projects that we\u2019re talking about that could be coming around the corner. I was just met this week with two, with our head of industrial area about two new potential large projects in the area.", "So I really don\u2019t have any specific concern there. I think some of those might be related to real-time pricing customers that chose to come off the system during the heat of the summer rather than pay some of the prices they might have had to pay.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then my last set of questions is related to the nuclear construction schedule and kind of the critical mix kind of critical path items. It sounds like maybe for unit three it\u2019s the CA02. Is that correct?", "Steve Byrne", "Say again, Dan.", "Dan Jenkins", "The critical path items both for Unit 2 and 3, so is the next one for Unit 2 that CA02 that you said is going to be placed in first half of \u201816 or is there something else before that?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. The next one of the structural modules to be placed will be that CA02 that you mentioned. The critical path right now on the units really is still running through the shield building. And we did placed first role of those shield building panels last quarter and we anticipate doing some more of those in the near future. But the critical path for the units really for both units still run through that shield building. We see the shield building panels, fit up the shield building panels and then pour the concrete in the panels, once they\u2019re in place and welded.", "Dan Jenkins", "What about so for Unit 3, is it -- it's pretty much the same as Unit 2 or is there given that there is a year difference in kind of the \u2026", "Steve Byrne", "Now Dan, it\u2019s basically the same story three and three.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "Sorry. Our next question will come from Mitchell Moss of Lord, Abbett. Please go ahead.", "Mitchell Moss", "Hi, just want to get a couple clarifications on the nuclear cost. Looking at the slide with -- that\u2019s show different option. I\u2019m sorry -- I\u2019m aging forward to that.", "Steve Byrne", "That slide 26.", "Mitchell Moss", "Slide 26, yeah. Of the updated amounts comparing the old order to the amended EPC, is there a rough break down how much of that is related to the two months delay in the substantial complete dates versus increase in construction cost or others stuff?", "Steve Byrne", "Yeah. The biggest part of that would be about $10 million a month and owners cost, so approximately $20 million of that would be related to that category.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay. And then if I think about the added cost of going from the amended EPC to the fixed price options, it looks like it's around $500 million, I guess, of the additional project costs. If I do the math from prior presentations, 2017 to 2019 CapEx is projected to be around $2 billion. So, should I think that that incremental $500 million effectively would fix but 2017 to 2019. If you are not going to make your decision necessarily until late 2016 then effectively you\u2019re really just fixing the 2017 to 2019 CapEx?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, Mitchell, we are fixing, if we elect the fixed price options but it doesn\u2019t directly correlate any kind of the specific burn rate. Remember the real different as you look there are about $500 million difference that you point out that really is the risk that the contractor will price and to fix it to us.", "So what you\u2019re doing is you are paying risk premium and then they have to make assumptions around things like inflation what the escalation rates are going to be. So that really is -- was a negotiated number but it really is reflective of the risk but now the contractor will have to take on.", "Jimmy Addison", "Mitchell, we\u2019re reflective of all payments made after June 15th of this year. If we elect the fixed price option, anything we pay or paid since June up until the time we elect that option, we get credit for 100%.", "Steve Byrne", "Mitchell, the CapEx schedule on page 10, we\u2019ve made our best estimate of how those amendments will affect the cash flow in the short term. But as Kevin said in his prepared comments, once this milestone payment schedule is developed, we are going to have to confirm the CapEx schedule, no matter which option we go with to match that. So those numbers will change. I\u2019m sure I just don't know exactly at this point.", "Mitchell Moss", "Sorry. They will change based on what?", "Jimmy Addison", "The milestone payment schedule that Kevin covered earlier, so we are going to develop -- this milestone payment schedule is going to be tied to specific milestones being accomplished. And then we\u2019ll confirm our CapEx and financing schedule to that depended upon which option we elect.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay. But once the fixed price option is selected that milestone payment schedule won't matter so much?", "Kevin Marsh", "No. It will. It is really critical because what we are going to do here from the next four or five month is develop the schedule. So there's clarity as to what need to be completed for a payment to be made to Westinghouse. And so once that schedule is completed there will be dollars assigned to that if we continue under the existing contract. And then there will be the dollars assigned to that if we were going under the fixed price contract.", "So the schedule will remain employed under either option. But the payment that go along with it will be based on whether we take the fixed price option or continue under the option we\u2019re working under today.", "Jimmy Addison", "So the contrast that we are going to make any payments in the future after this payment schedule is agreed to based upon the calendar, they are going to based upon actual results.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, sir.", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction] We have a follow-up question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Hey, there again. Sorry to follow-up here. I just wanted to reach back on this fixed price auction and just kind of understand where the potential liabilities still lie on your side if there is indeed a protracted schedule here?", "So, could you perhaps give us a sense a little bit more? I know you covered a little bit with Paul. But to the extent, you have a timeline shift, where are you responsible, what specific costs do you responsible for in the fixed price options that you\u2019ve laid out if you choose to go that way?", "Kevin Marsh", "Okay. The total fixed price options would be $7.601 billion as we\u2019ve laid out on slide 26. It\u2019s the third or fourth lying down. That would be the total expected project cost. Of that, the capital cost portion over the year, the construction contract, EPC contract will be $6.757 billion. So the additional amount would be escalation to date on the existing work that's been done.", "And then some additional dollars, the additional $20 million associated with the schedule moving out two months for owner\u2019s cost. Both of that is fixed in the fixed price contract, and that would be based on the guaranteed substantial completion dates of unit two, August of 2019, and unit three August of 2020. And the liquidated damages are key to all of us for each of those dates for specific units.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Got it. But, could you give us a sense of how much would be exposed to and by what variables? If you were to have for instance, the shift off of that August of 2019 and 2020 date? Just to kind of give us a sense of the magnitude there, I appreciate that a lot of it would be presumably fixed but..?", "Steve Byrne", "Julien. This is Steve. The only thing that would not be fixed would be the things that we would be responsible before outside of the EPC contract, so that will be our owners\u2019 cost and then the transmission. But we can finish the transmission even if the plans are not finished. So really, it comes down just to owners\u2019 costs.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "And can you remind us what that is per month?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah. We are looking at a burn rate and owners\u2019 costs at somewhere in the range of $10 million a month.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Got it. Excellent. Well. Thank you again.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, sir.", "Operator", "The next question will be a follow-up from Jim von Riesemann of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. I\u2019m going to go back to depreciation a second if you guys don\u2019t mind. So what were the assets that were changed in the depreciation lines to get such a big number on an EPS business? I\u2019m sorry I forgot that.", "Kevin Marsh", "No. I don\u2019t know that you forgot. And I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been published anywhere. But what we really did, we refreshed our entire comprehensive depreciation study across the whole electric systems. So it includes the T&D and the generation system.", "Jim von Riesemann", "What gen -- can you buck it which was -- might have been generation versus the T&D? And then I\u2019m trying to think what\u2019s your big generation assets are because the older ones already got a long useful life, right.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yeah. We are down to about five significant generating plants outside of new nuclear. So, I really can't give you the buckets here, Jim. You can probably go to the PSC website and get more details on it and publicly there.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "But Jim -- big picture, Jim, it is trying to match up the real expected lives to the depreciation schedule. And for example, at our nuclear facilities, we would anticipate that as opposed to just the 20-year life extension that we will be pursuing a second life extension. So that would take that plant out to 80 years total. And then we are using actual history on some of the plants that we've been operating and we are extending the depreciation scales out on those plants to get match up with what we really think is the useful life.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. That\u2019s what I was after. Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David Fishman", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I just have a quick follow-up on what Michael asked about. I was just wondering does PSNC have a historical or forward test years.", "Kevin Marsh", "Historical.", "David Fishman", "Historical. All right. Great. Thank you.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes.", "David Fishman", "Congrats again.", "Operator", "And our next question will be a follow-up from Feliks Kerman of Visium Asset Management. Please go ahead.", "Feliks Kerman", "Hi. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. When we come down to the point of making decision between the fixed option and the current, would it makes sense to get commission approval prior to choosing the fixed option or how should we think about that?", "Kevin Marsh", "No. The way the process would work is we have an obligation to go back to the commission, if there was a change in the price, the capital call schedule that they\u2019ve already approved. So either option would require us to go to the condition at some point, so we need to make an election of which options we believe is superior.", "So, we can go back to the commission, ask for approval of that option. It wouldn\u2019t be likely that we will go back to a commission and say you tell us which one you like and we will hit down that road. They will look for us to make a recommendation, a specific recommendation to them.", "Feliks Kerman", "And when can we expect that to happen.", "Kevin Marsh", "We have 12 months from the effective date to make that option. So -- excuse me, it run in November 1, 2016, that\u2019s the specific date in the contract.", "Feliks Kerman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Kevin Marsh", "When we will go and ask for it?", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Well. Thank you very much and certainly so far this year has been very eventful. We are very pleased with our progress with the resolutions to the negotiations and with our financial results through the first three quarters. We continue to focus on the new nuclear construction and on operating all of our business in a safe and reliable manner. And we thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, February 18, 2016. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Susan Wright", "Thank you, and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and Steve will provide an update of our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other investor information directly to our Web site at scana.com. On SCANA\u2019s homepage, there is a yellow box containing links to the new nuclear development and other Investor Information sections of the Web site.

You can sign-up for e-mail alerts under the Investors section of scana.com to notify you when there is a new posting in the nuclear development and/or other Investor Information sections of the Web site.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today\u2019s call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site under Webcasts & Presentations.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings in the fourth quarter is mainly attributable to the negative impact of weather on electric margins, as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. Lower gas margins also reflect $0.07 per share of lost margins due to the sale of CGT early in the year.", "These losses were partially offset by higher electric margins, due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as lower depreciation expense as a result of a new depreciation study. And lower O&M expense due primarily to labor savings and the impact of the sales of CGT during the first quarter of 2015. Note, too, that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.14 per share and $0.02 per share versus normal in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively.", "Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $5.22 versus $3.79 in 2014. The improved results are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as lower depreciation expense and O&M, as described earlier.", "These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather, lower gas margins -- primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.23 per share resulting from the sale of CGT and the impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business. And normal increases in CapEx related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.13 per share due to weather year over year, abnormal weather increased electric margins in both years, accounting for $0.08 per share in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014.", "Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized basis. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.83 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Full-year earnings were $3.73 per share in 2015 compared to $3.58 per share in the prior year. As a reminder, GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins, and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015.", "Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure, as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina businesses. And the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant. However, the extremely mild weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 was seen in that business as standalone results, as I'll discuss later.", "Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's fourth-quarter 2015 earnings were down $0.01 per share compared to the same period of 2014. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins due to abnormal weather, and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes.", "These decreases more than offset increases due to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth in both the electric and gas businesses, the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates, and lower O&M due primarily to labor savings. For the full-year 2015, earnings were higher by $0.12 per share due to increased electric margins, primarily from the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, and customer growth, improved gas margins due to customer growth, and the application of new depreciation rates.", "These items were partially offset by the effective abnormal weather on electric margins and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, dilution, and continued increases in depreciation exclusive of the impact of the depreciation study. Although weather in both years contributed favorably to electric margins versus normal, 2015 was milder than 2014, with weather contributing $0.08 of margin versus normal in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. For the year ended December 2015, earnings are $0.38 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the prior year.", "SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in fourth-quarter earnings of $0.06 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year. Primarily due to lower throughput and margins attributable to the extremely warm weather during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, earnings were down $0.05 per share compared to the same period of 2014, due to the same drivers as the quarter.", "On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins at our marketing business were primarily offset by foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the fourth quarter of this year. For the 12 month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.36 in 2015 compared to $0.01 loss in 2014. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS was down $0.04 from the prior year, due primarily to foregone earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year. Offset by lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins in our marketing business.", "I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. In 2015, companies announced plans to invest over $2 billion with the expectation of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment, and we're pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence, and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.7%.", "At the top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina employment statistics as of December 2015 and 2014. Over the course of 2015, South Carolina's unemployment rate has dropped over a percentage point from its level at the end of 2014. December of 2015 also marked all-time highs for the number of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. Of particular interest, and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.8% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Said another way, had the labor force not increased during 2015, the unemployment rate would be approximately 3%. The expansion of the labor force is simply evidence of the confidence of some of the workforce to re-enter the market, and the positive migration to the State of South Carolina.", "As depicted on the bottom of the slide, United Van Lines recently released its annual mover study for 2015, which tracks migration patterns state to state. For the third consecutive year, South Carolina finished ranked second in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer growth statistics. North Carolina has also been ranked in the Top 5 for the last three years.", "Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales are up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. In conjunction with the continued improvement of economic conditions in South Carolina, the past two quarters have shown an accelerating improvement in usage in the residential market.", "And now please turn to Slide 10, which recaps our regulator rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.6 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 in the base electric business is approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.", "As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% and 10.6% in our LDCs in South and North Carolina, respectively. In response to the normal attrition and the earned returns in our North Carolina business, yesterday PSNC notified the North Carolina Utilities Commission of its intention to file a rate case. We plan to file the detailed case within the next 60 days, where more clarity will be provided. As you will recall, in South Carolina, if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending in March falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June.", "Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the Company's current estimate of New Nuclear spending through 2018, and has been updated to reflect what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC that was announced in October 2015. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated New Nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30, to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. Slide 12 presents the transition payments information and an expected timeframe for our filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan.", "And now please turn to Slide 13 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open rocket purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. And again, the election of the fixed price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continued to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50/50 debt and equity basis.", "On Slide 14, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share, with an internal target of $4 per share. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view, and are increasing the lower band of our long-term growth rate from 3% to 4%. We are also resetting our base year to 2015 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS of $3.73.", "Therefore, our new GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized annual growth guidance target will be to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over the three to five years using a base of 2015 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS of $3.73. This increase represents our projected earnings momentum, driven by our BLRA filings, our stated goal to manage base retail electric returns, and our view of the economy, balanced with our continued assumption of the impacts of energy conservation and efficiency standards. I also wanted to mention that earlier today we announced an increase of $0.12 in our annual dividend rate for 2016, to $2.30 per share, a 5.5% increase. We continue to anticipate growing dividends fairly consistent with earnings, while staying within our stated pay-out policy of 55% to 60%.", "And finally, on Slide 15, we are very pleased to report that in late December, we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction project and accelerated CapEx spending at PSNC. The committed lines of credit now total $2 billion. I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs, and therefore, the support of our nuclear expansion plans.", "We are pleased that we continue to receive an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors, as well as our banks. And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks Jimmy. I'd like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the Consortium. Slide 16 presents the outline we have shown in previous discussions, as a recap. As you may be aware, Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December, and Fluor began work as a subcontracted construction manager at the New Nuclear construction-site on January 4.", "We continue our analysis of the fixed price option, and will include input from Fluor as they progress. As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed price option or not. And we plan to take as much time as needed to insure that we make the most prudent decision. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. As Jimmy said earlier, we expect to reach a conclusion in the second quarter.", "Moving on to some of the activities at the New Nuclear construction-site, Slide 17 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. I've provided this photo to give you a view of the layout of the site. And I've labeled both Units 2 & 3, as well as many other areas that make up what we call the table top. On Slide 18, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 Nuclear Island. In this picture you can see Module CA20 on the right hand side of the slide along the containment vessel Ring Number 1, which was placed on and welded to the lower bowl. Several of the large structural modules have now been placed inside the Unit 2 containment vessel. As we will discuss shortly, you can also see the beginnings of the shield building, as three courses have now been placed.", "Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. Module CA04 was placed inside the containment vessel lower bowl back in June, and the auxiliary building walls continue to go further. As you'll see shortly, we are making progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules on both units. Slide 20 presents a schematic view of the five large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. I've shown this schematic numerous times before because this expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA01 through CA05 fit spatially inside the containment vessel. As we you may know, we have now placed CA01, CA04 and CA05 for Unit 2, and CA04 for Unit 3.", "Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA02 module. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the unit containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned last quarter, CA02 is now structurally complete and awaiting installation. Slide 22 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA03, which is the west wall of the unit containment refueling water storage tank. 15 of CA03s 17 sub-modules are on-site, and 12 are now on their assembly platform. Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication on the Unit 3 CA05 has been completed, and it has been staged outside the modular assembly building, or MAB.", "Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 CA20, which is the auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 68 of the 72 sub-modules are on-site, and 20 of those sub-modules have been upended on the construction platform or flattened for fabrication in the MAB. Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA01. Module CA01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer, and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 15 of the 47 sub-modules on-site, and three of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together in the MAB.", "Slide 26 shows the progress of the placement of the Unit 2 shield building panels. The first six-panel course was placed during the first half of 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the second six-panel course was set on top of the first course. And at the beginning of this month, we placed the third six-panel course. As the shield building panels are placed and welded together, concrete is poured inside the panels to create the shield building. Concrete has been placed in the first two courses. Slide 27 shows a couple of pictures from the Unit 2 turbine pedestal concrete placement from December of 2015. Overall, more than 2,300 cubic yards of concrete was placed over the course of about 20 hours.", "Slide 28 shows a picture of the single phase for the 230-ton Unit 2 main transformers. There are four such transformers for each unit. And here you can see one of the four being rigged for placement adjacent to the Unit 2 turbine building. Each unit will have these four, plus six other transformers. All 10 of them in place for Unit 2, and all 10 have been received for Unit 3. On Slide 29, you'll see the New Nuclear CapEx, actual and projected, over the life of the construction. This chart shows CWIP during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the Q4 of 2015 BLRA quarterly report that we filed in February. As a reminder, the BLRA report now reflects the cost from the October 2015 amended EPC. As you can see, we're currently in the middle of the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA, and is associated with the right-hand axis.", "Please now turn to Slide 30. As we mentioned during our third-quarter call in September, the PSC approved a rate increase of $64.5 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2016 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And as you can see, we recently filed our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter, and our next quarterly update will be filed in mid May. Not depicted here, but in the update filing I addressed earlier, the timing of that petition isn't yet known.", "Finally, I wanted to mention the results of an analysis performed at the direction of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. As you may be aware, the ORS contracted an independent accounting firm to determine whether the revised rate provision under the Base Load Review Act is cost-beneficial to SCE&G customers, consistent with our claims. This independent attestation, and concluded in January, and reaffirmed the significant cost advantage of the BLRA as envisioned when the law was originally passed. This report is available on the ORS's Web site, and a link to the independent accounting firm's report can be found in the regulatory document section of the Nuclear Development area of SCANA's Investor Web site. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim von Riesemann of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jim von Riesemann", "A couple questions on the 4% to 6% growth rate, can you just elaborate again on how that's calculated? How we should think about the out years? Because if somebody were to do a linear analysis, 2016 would be less than the 4%, if you are just growing 2016 versus 2015, did I make sense, or have I been on too many conference calls today?", "Jimmy Addison", "The first part of your question made sense. So how we calculate it is, the average of the annual increases over that three- to five-year period. So we're comfortable that, that average growth in our plan today is at that 4% to 6% level. Now, the second part I'm not sure I followed.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Yes, I don't think I followed it either. But it's just really to get to 2016 versus 2015, because you're not on a 4% plain year over year, especially with your guidance of $4.", "Jimmy Addison", "You are saying it\u2019s above it right?", "Jim von Riesemann", "Yes.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, and so -- but that's why we consider it over the entire period, not just any one year. So every year wouldn't necessarily be within that cone, but overall, the average would be.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay that I understand. So the question then becomes, with the fixed price option and your updated CapEx on the slides, how much of that is reflective -- is anything reflected in, I guess, either your growth rate or for the fixed price option in your CapEx, or even your earnings growth rate?", "Jimmy Addison", "So the CapEx is based upon the amended agreement. It does not include the fixed price option. And that's what our growth rate is based upon. I'm not sure that, if we were to adopt that option, that it would have a material impact on the earnings growth rate. But if we do later this year, and if it's approved, we will certainly consider that.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. And then I guess I have a question on bonus depreciation.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Previously, that was about 75 million a year. Have you updated those numbers given the tax extenders from December?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, that still is a good reference, the 75 million a year in the base business. And of course, what's different now is the five-year view; so we have not had that in the past. So there's obviously the potential for the New Nuclear units themselves to qualify for bonus depreciation. Although not at the 50% level, because it phases down to 40% and 30% in 2018 and 2019, respectively, so that's the only thing that's outside that $75 million estimate.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. And then I guess the last question, really, maybe is for Steve. How -- if you think about all of the components to build the two summer units, how much of them are still, say, overseas and still need to be shipped to the place? Or are most of the components on-site at this point in time?", "Steve Byrne", "A majority of the major components are on-site. I would say about 85%, and the remainder would be either overseas or domestic production. Of the major components left outstanding that would be overseas -- let's see, one of the -- we've got two steam generators in Tucson. One of those is being shipped; the other one is nearing completion. I think all of the turbine generator stuff is on-site, condenser stuff is on-site, containment is on-site. We've got a couple of passive heat exchangers that are being reworked in Italy. Those should be finished shortly. We had cone pumps; those are domestic, but those won't show up until 2017. That's most of the major stuff.", "Now, when we get into sub-modules, we still have some of the sub-modules for the structural modules, particularly for the trailing unit, Unit 3. They are still in fabrication. And so for example, CA01 is being fabricated between Toshiba in Japan and IHI in Japan. There are 47 different sub-modules that are associated with the unit. 15 have been delivered, 15 of the 47. Seven have shipped. It just takes awhile for them to get here. And so the 25 are yet to be shipped. So we've got almost half of those are either on-site or on the ocean. So I think if I were to categorize it, 85% of the major equipment is on-site. And of the remaining stuff, a lot of it is physically complete. Some of it is waiting to be shipped; some is on the ocean now, on its way to our site.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein", "Hi, this is Mike Weinstein, a couple of questions. One, did you say what was causing the drop-off in industrial growth, weather-adjusted?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I really didn't address that. It's not a significant change, just showing down there about 0.5%. The one thing that makes it difficult to really address this quarter is, as you'll probably remember from the national news is, we had a historic flood in central South Carolina. And there was an extensive impact on our industrial customers -- everything from as simple as logistics of workers not being able to get to plants, to industrial intakes malfunctioning because of the extremely high water, to impacts on rail. So it's really difficult to quantify that, so I'm not too alarmed by one period here of slightly down.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay. And what's causing the steep drop in SCE&G's on the gas side, on its ROE versus PSNC. Which, when you look at the September numbers, there's almost no change in North Carolina, but South Carolina really seems to have come off.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, it's a function of obviously the rate base additions, as well as the operating cost, et cetera, involved in the units, and as well as the timing. I believe the South Carolina number is as of September 30, and the PSNC number is, I believe, at December 31. We just haven't filed the South Carolina report yet, so we haven't updated that one.", "Mike Weinstein", "All right, that makes sense. And on the nuclear side, the CapEx looks like it's about $200 million higher in the peak spending years, 2017 and 2018. And it seems to flow through right into the CWIP. And I'm just wondering, does that mean that -- does that result in higher BLRA rate increases going forward? And is that a result of the new -- that's all as a result of the settlement, right?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, so the CapEx numbers haven't changed at all from what we presented in the third quarter. And this assumes just the amended agreement, not the fixed price option. All that's changed is the timing of when they occur in this presentation, Michael, so that's really the only adjustment.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay, it's just a timing issue.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay all right and I guess thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Travis Miller", "You mentioned the second quarter, wanted to make the decision then on the fixed price option. Wondered if you could give me a timeline and thoughts on why you wouldn't wait until November? And then secondly, if you do make that decision in the second quarter, what's the regulatory schedule look like from that point?", "Jimmy Addison", "Let me start and then let Steve jump in. So we said that it's likely to be Q2. That's our best judgment. But Steve also said in the opening comments that we have until November. And if we think we need all that time, we will take all that time. So we're just giving you our most likely estimate of when we think we'll have a good assessment of Fluor's input, et cetera, to make that call. And at the point that we feel like we have that and have our information together, we'll make a filing with the Public Service Commission. And then they have their statutory six months to rule on that. And ballpark, sometime in the middle of that six months, we would be before them to present our information to ask for their support.", "Steve Byrne", "Travis, this is Steve. One train of thought would be, take as long as you've got to make the decision, which we fully understand. But we did in an ex parte fashion, brief our Public Service Commission on the two options that we would have going forward. And what we told them was as soon as we were complete with our evaluation we would come back to them with the option that we selected. So we intend to do that. One complicator that you might not see that makes my life a little more difficult is that in the interim, I have to sort of keep two sets of books. So I have to base assumptions on both where we're exercising the fixed price option and we're not exercising the fixed price option. And if we're going to exercise one or the other, it's a lot simpler for me -- I can drop the other set of the books. So it takes all kinds of commercial issues off the table and just makes our lives a lot easier.", "Travis Miller", "So you briefed the regulators. Has there been any conversation or interaction with interveners or other groups that you think might have opposition to, say, the fixed price option, or at least a preference to one or the other?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, we've done a number of briefings, some of which were public. We did a briefing for the legislature, for example. We've done briefings with the governor's Nuclear Advisory Council. And some of the interveners were present during the ex parte briefing we had last November with the Public Service Commission. But there was no interaction with them at that point in time. So we have and will continue to have some interactions, but we don't know who all of the interveners might be until we file something. And then they're given the opportunity to intervene. So it's not a surprise, but we won't have any more conversation with our Public Service Commission until we make a filing. We aren't allowed to have any conversation with them about the topic.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Steven Byrd", "I wanted to just talk about Toshiba for a moment. Toshiba has been in the press of late. And at a high level, just wanted to understand, as you think about their credit position and safeguards and protections for you, how should we think about ways that you can receive protection against potential deterioration in credit quality at Toshiba?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, well, let me just talk briefly about some contract provisions in a conceptual form, and then I'll let Steve talk some operationally about the project. So we do have some security provisions in the contract if their ratings fall below a certain grade, and they have triggered those now. And we have initiated that security. And for confidentiality reasons, I'm just not going to get into the details of what that is, how much it is, et cetera. But it's essentially meant to handle any kind of payment obligations were they not to be able to pay subcontractors, things of that nature. As well as performance obligations if they don't live up to their terms of the contract, so that's kind of the financial construct that's in the contract that we have pulled the trigger on. And I'll just let Steve talk a little about the project itself.", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, we've been tracking the situation at Toshiba. Obviously a very large company, I think the Japanese government would be loath to see them fail. But they have submitted obviously a restructuring plan. We were heartened to see in their restructuring plan that they intend to stay in the energy business. While they do intend to shed some of their business lines, they are going to stay in the energy business, which would include nuclear, so that's a good thing for us. Also we are glad to see that, with the significant changes in leadership and the board at Toshiba, that the person that we have been largely dealing with in the nuclear arena survived that turmoil. And again, we think that's a good thing.", "I do believe that Toshiba has been successful at securing some debt from some large Japanese banks just recently. Bankruptcy also doesn't necessarily mean that things would stop. There are various kinds of bankruptcies. Not that we think it will get to that point, but it doesn't necessarily mean things at the site will stop. And in addition to the sort of the financial protections that Jimmy just alluded to, we did actually forecast a situation like this back when we were negotiating the EPC contract. Not necessarily that we thought that the larger corporation, Toshiba, might have financial difficulties. But we were really focusing on perhaps the smaller corporations like Westinghouse and/or Shaw might have some financial difficulties. So we do have in the contract some provisions to escrow intellectual properties, such that if there were to be a succession of operations by the contractor, that we could finish the plant on our own.", "Steven Byrd", "And just shifting over to the Sanmen project in China, just wondered if you had any update there in terms of the status of Sanmen?", "Steve Byrne", "I don't have any recent updates on Sanmen. We have a team that's supposed to go over there, I think it's in the April or May timeframe. So we'll get more firsthand information then. My understanding is that we still anticipate that Sanmen 1 will come online sometime this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Weisel", "Two questions, first one is about the new long-term growth rate. Could you maybe talk outside of whether a major pick-up in the economy, what are some factors that could potentially take you to or above the high-end of that 6% level?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, I think the largest kind of at-risk variable from a positive or a negative standpoint, Andrew, is probably what happens with usage on electric, on the electric side, unrelated to weather. So what goes on in that area I mean, it's obviously related to the economy, but what do people do with everyday electric consumption? And that's been very difficult for our industry to model the last several years. It flattened out and was slightly up for us in 2015. That surprised us in a good way, a little. But that continues to be the most difficult thing for us to model.", "Andrew Weisel", "Anything on the capital side, obviously the nuclear CapEx estimates are constantly being adjusted. But anything in the base business that might get you, like I said, toward or above the high-end? Or potentially anything that can go wrong that would take you below that low-end?", "Jimmy Addison", "We feel pretty good about our CapEx plan. I mean, setting aside the New Nuclear, as you said in your question, which has the dynamic adjustment due to the project. We are doing in the base business the things we need to do to have safe, reliable power. But we aren't doing a great deal of things beyond that in order to maintain no base rate increases during this period, or pressure on returns, if we were not to have increases. PSNC is probably the biggest story outside of that, with the growth in that area, particularly in the transmission area. And of course, we said earlier that we filed yesterday a notice of a pending rate increase there. But that is fairly well laid out. That could change some, based upon price of steel, and compression, and that kind of thing, over time. But I don't expect it to vary a great deal.", "Andrew Weisel", "And then my other question is about the dividend. Obviously a bigger increase today than what we've seen in the past few years. And that takes you right to the midpoint of your targeted pay-out ratio, if we assume the midpoint of the EPS guidance. Going forward, should we expect the dividend to grow more of that kind of 5% range, which is the midpoint of the EPS growth? Or would it be more likely to revert back to the 3% or 4% range like what we've seen in the past several years?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes if you'll bear with me, let me give you 30 seconds of history here. When the recession hit and earnings slowed a great deal, we got outside of our pay-out policy of 55% to 60%. We got up close to 65% -- 63% to 65%. We continued to grow dividends during those next few years, but we grew them at about half the rate of earnings growth, so that we could get back within the policy. And now we're comfortably back within the policy, and our position at this point is, we expect to grow those dividends fairly consistent with earnings growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Jenkins with The State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins", "So first of all, I was just curious, on your financing plan for 2016, you show about $1 billion for SCE&G. I was wondering if you could give any insight as to the timing, would that be like throughout the year, or first half, second half?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, so today, we would model in roughly half of it about mid-year and half of it near the end of the year. That is definitely going to need to be dynamically adjusted to which option we end up electing, and the payment schedule that goes along with that, that we've talked about on the last call, as well as briefly on this one. So that's really going to cause adjustments in that schedule. So I'm fairly sure it will adjust from this, but today's best guess is about half mid-year and about half near the end of the year.", "Dan Jenkins", "Going to the nuclear unit, and in particular, I looked through the report you just filed for the fourth-quarter report. And in particular, it mentioned how the shield building is one of the primary critical path of things -- items that's potentially could, I guess -- some of those modules you're having trouble with, or whatever. So I was wondering if you could expand on that, and what the timing is, you think, when that item will be able to be resolved?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, I think the shield building items -- when you say resolved I think we resolved most of our shield building issues there. The biggest issue that we had really was, they anticipated that the fit-up of this first-of-a-kind items, taking these individual panels that come from Newport News Industrial, or NNI, and then putting them together at the site, welding them up within the tolerances, and then filling them with concrete -- was going to be very difficult. We've done a lot of mock-ups. We've received probably half the panels for the first unit and maybe 25% for the second unit. The placement so far ought to be categorized as going a little better than we had anticipated. So we've got 16 courses of steel panels that go in a ring that we eventually will fill with concrete. We've placed the first three of those courses already. The first two have been welded, fit and we poured concrete in. And the third course, we recently placed, so we're welding that. But again, that's going, I think, better than we had anticipated.", "So now our focus, since that is the critical path, is insuring that we get the sub-modules, the pieces, the panels, from NNI in a timely fashion. So Westinghouse has taken over the contract that CB&I used to have, so that's now exclusively a Westinghouse-to-NNI deal, which we think is good. And then the delivery schedule looks to be good. And they're negotiating a mitigation strategy. And in effect I'll be going to NNI tomorrow to talk through the mitigation strategy that will accelerate some of those panel deliveries to the site. So I think the shield building, right now it's going pretty well. But it is our focus area, because it is critical path.", "Dan Jenkins", "And then similarly, it talks a little bit about secondary critical paths being the CA20 and CA01 for Unit 3. Are those like parallel paths to the shield building issues, or are they dependent on the shield building path?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, Dan, not necessarily dependent on the shield building. But they would come in right in line after the shield building. So once we demonstrate proficiency with shield building, then you focus on whatever is next. So we're always looking at primary, secondary, tertiary critical paths. So the secondary critical path is, as you mentioned, that CA20 module for the trailing Unit 3. We've already set CA20 for Unit 2 obviously. And we did come up with an interesting mitigation strategy for the CA20 module, whereas, on the first unit, on Unit 2, we set it as one piece. On the second one, we're going to set it in two halves. And so that will save us probably a couple of months in the fabrication. And that's important, because it actually forms a part of the concrete form work for the rest of the plant. So it's important that we set that half of that, and use it as a form concrete while we're working on the second half, and then set the second half. So as of right now, I thought that, that was -- that the team on-site came up with that plan, we're executing on that plan, and we ought to set that first half, CA20, for the second unit, in Q1, late Q1. And then we should set the second half of CA20 for Unit 3 probably early in Q2.", "Dan Jenkins", "And somewhat related to that, it mentions on -- I don't know if you have the report in front of you -- on page 15 of it, in the middle of it, kind of related to the CA01 and CA20. That on the current schedule, the date doesn't support the construction schedule for the units, so how is that being impacted in the overall schedule? How should we think about that? How much can that be mitigated?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, I think a good example of mitigation is the plan that we came up with to split the CA20 module into two halves. And CA01, we're looking at similar things there. We're looking to expedite the delivery of the sub-modules from IHI and Toshiba in Japan. Toshiba obviously has all the incentive in the world under the agreement that we negotiated in October to expedite whatever they can. So they both have -- since they're the parent company of Westinghouse, there are both penalties if they don't do things on time, and there are significant bonus incentives if they do finish on time. So they've got as much incentive as we could possibly put into an agreement. So we'll look to accelerate the schedule for the modules coming out of Japan for CA01. And we're implementing a strategy to split CA20, set it in two halves instead of one large piece [indiscernible] CA20 portion.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Reeder", "One quick point of clarity, so if Fluor's assessment of the schedule comes back that the current schedule isn't kind of feasible, how does that work then? Do you have to then negotiate another amended EPC contract before you would file that with the Commission so that the benchmarks, the milestones, are set appropriately in the next kind of approved BLRA?", "Jimmy Addison", "Jonathan, I think the short answer is, it depends on how far out they are. If you'll remember with our last order from the Public Service Commission, we had a plus 18 months for each of the milestones. So as long as we stay within that 18 months, we don't need to go back in on the schedule. So really, it's going to depend on how far. But what I more envision is that Fluor might come back and say -- in order to get the schedule on time, you have to accelerate this, you might have to bring in more resources than we have in the current plan. So where we think we're going to peak at, say, 4,000 craft employees, they might come back and say -- you need to get 4,500 craft employees. And that kind of an input might drive us towards opting for the fixed price, because more people mean more dollars.", "Jonathan Reeder", "Right, so that would impact, I guess, the non-fixed price option, and probably lend more credibility towards selecting the fixed price. That's the way to think about it?", "Jimmy Addison", "Correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides", "A couple of nuts and bolts questions on the gas side of the business. First of all, at PSNC, if you filed later this Spring, when would rates go into effect? I forget, is that a 6- or a 12-month process in North Carolina?", "Jimmy Addison", "6.", "Michael Lapides", "Okay. So rates would go in no later than like January 1 next year. And that's a historical-looking rate case there, or can you do a forward or a big known immeasurable?", "Jimmy Addison", "It's a bit of both. It's a base historical test year, but you can kind of update for CWIP, as well as cap structure, kind of concurrent with the information being presented and any settlement being discussed or hearing before the Commission.", "Michael Lapides", "And on the gas side at SCE&G, when would you file under the Rate Stabilization Act to get a revenue increase? When does that normally happen, and when would that go into effect?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, so that runs through the end of the heating season, the measurement period through the end of March, and we make the filing in May of each year. And any adjustment either way, if we're 50 basis points out, would be effective the first of November for the implementation of the typical heating season in the fall although that did not happen this past year.", "Michael Lapides", "And then, Steve, one question I just want to make sure I understood that your comments about Toshiba and some of the financial and credit metric issues Toshiba has. And you've mentioned that you already started the process with Toshiba to kind of recover some of the security-related funds. Did you do that because of their downgrades? Did you do that because Toshiba is having issues paying some of the local subcontractors, or some of the vendors or suppliers? What was the main driver for starting the process now?", "Jimmy Addison", "Hi Michael this is Jimmy, I commented on that earlier, so I'll clean it up here. No, that's just procedural. It's just an option afforded us under the contract. We've had no issues that we're aware of at all with any subs being paid, or anything like that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Claire Tse of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "David Paz", "Hi this is actually David Paz. Sorry if I missed this earlier. Does your 4% to 6% EPS growth rate assume any bonus depreciation impact on the New Nuclear units when they come into service in 2019 and 2020?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, the guidance assumes the bonus depreciation on the base business. We've really not contemplated yet or modeled exactly what might happen with the bonus depreciation on the new units themselves. There's a lot of consideration has to go into that, along with the production tax credits, et cetera, to make sure we maximize the value for the customer.", "David Paz", "I see. So it's not -- it essentially hasn't been modeled in the 4% to 6%?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right.", "David Paz", "Okay. Do you happen to know, or can I find somewhere in the BLRA filings what the cumulative costs for Unit 2 would be through 2019, as you currently stand today?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, on the amended contract, it's about -- the total price of the units is about $7.1 billion, so you can roughly estimate 50% of that.", "David Paz", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "David, are you looking for what\u2019s been spent to-date?", "David Paz", "Well, not just to-date, but obviously you have the BLRAs by year. But if I knew just what Unit 2's portion was through that 2019, that's what I was trying to get a more exact number. But obviously I can ballpark it.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. We\u2019ve not broken it out between Unit 2 and Unit 3 so yes you\u2019d have to ballpark it.", "David Paz", "And then just can you go through the process for how each unit goes into rate base? Like is there a formal filing with the PSC when each unit is completed? How is that process?", "Jimmy Addison", "So what we do is, we have to prepare a projected operating cost-year, if you will, so an implementation year. The first phase of the BLRA is to get the plans approved. The second phase happens each year, are the revised rates. And the third is the operating cost going in. And so we'll have to project what the depreciation and the operating costs, et cetera, are. And that does not require a hearing. It just requires us to present it to the Office of Regulatory Staff and to the Commission like we do the revised rates each year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Paul Patterson", "I wanted to touch base with you on the last question there, on the BLRA and the bonus depreciation. It sounds like you guys were trying to -- that you were analyzing the PTC and the impact of taking bonus, and what have you. And I'm just trying to get a sense as to what that process is kind of like, and sort of some of the factors that sort of go around that, if you follow me? And how that might change the 4% to 6% potentially?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, the only real impact is likely to be just on financing itself, and any temporary benefits on financing. I mean, bonus depreciation is simply accelerating a deduction that you're going to get at some point in the future, to an earlier point in time. So you aren't going to change your total taxes per books, because you're going to change your deferred taxes. So if you end up with a larger deferred tax credit because of the bonus depreciation, you're going to end up with lower rate base there in the short run. But in the very short run, it's just going to have some financing benefits to it, just like the bonus depreciation does on the base business.", "Paul Patterson", "Well, that's what I was wondering. I'm just wondering whether or not -- I mean, I understand that. I guess what I'm wondering is, is there any potential impact in the near term if the bonus depreciation was factored into it? In other words, how should we think about the potential sensitivity in the near term if bonus depreciation, which my understanding, is not being factored in now, if it were to come in, can you give us any rule of thumb or thought process as to if there would be impact, and what that impact might be?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, we're talking about something that would potentially be a cash impact in the second half of 2019, so I don't really see any near-term impact on it.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. So in other words, if the bonus depreciation, there's no potential for it to take -- it would happen then regardless, it wouldn't be happening any time earlier in terms of your analysis?", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s right. That\u2019s correct.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay, thanks so much for the clarity. And then just finally on the sales growth, I believe you guys, in your last IRP, were around 1.4% for retail sales growth, I think, just over the long period. Is that still pretty much what you guys are looking at?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, we\u2019re going to be filing a new IRP, what in the next few weeks Steve?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes. Within the next two weeks.", "Jimmy Addison", "And we were just reviewing a draft of that earlier this week, and I don't think where we are at, at this point is materially different. But we'll be filing that in the next few weeks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mitchell Moss of Lord, Abbett. Please go ahead.", "Jimmy Addison", "Mitchell, we can\u2019t hear you.", "Mitchell Moss", "Sorry about that.", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay, good. Just to follow-up on some of the questions on Toshiba's credit ratings and downgrades. In terms of next steps, if there are further downgrades for Toshiba, is there a -- is it kind of like incremental steps of, if there's a single -- if Toshiba's rating moves down one more notch, there's sort of one or two more steps? Or is there sort of Toshiba has to fall several rating notches from here before you guys would need to, I guess, do further action regarding taking any security actions?", "Jimmy Addison", "Right, so the contractual security provisions I mentioned earlier are binary. Their ratings meet the criteria for us to elect those, or they don't. And they've met those, so there's no further impacts, there's no graded scale or anything.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay. So the ratings, where they're at now, you haven't needed to take any -- there haven't been any security provisions activated, or there have been?", "Jimmy Addison", "There have not been in the past, we recently initiated those and they have 60 days for those to be fulfilled.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay.", "Jimmy Addison", "And those are all of the provisions once fulfilled.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay. And just on a more of a technical question, your Slide 13 I believe yes Slide 13 shows debt refinancings at SCANA in 2018 are 170 million utility is 550. Last quarter you had combined it at about 720 all that SCANA and so I just wanted to find out to better understand I see the 550 in terms of just that at the utility I just want those understand 170 million of SCANA debt is?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, that relates to the South Carolina Generating Company. But it's one plant that operates solely for SCE&G. All the power goes to SCE&G. So it's a separately financed plant, but it's solely related to -- we call it GenCo -- South Carolina Generating Company.", "Mitchell Moss", "Okay. So, it's not really a holding company debt.", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s right but it technically is a subsidiary of SCANA and that\u2019s the reason we presented it that way.", "Operator", "And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Well. Thank you so far this has been a very eventful and productive year and we're excited about the new arrangement with Westinghouse and Fleur. We continue to focus on the new nuclear construction and on operating all of our businesses in a safe and reliable manner. We thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 28, 2016. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.", "Susan Wright", "Thank you, and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2016. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and Steve will provide an update of our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other investor information directly to our Web site at scana.com. On SCANA\u2019s homepage, there is a yellow box containing links to the new nuclear development and other Investor Information sections of the Web site. It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time-to-time may be deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. You can sign-up for e-mail alerts under the Investors section of scana.com to notify you when there is a new posting in the nuclear development and/or other Investor Information sections of the Web site.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today\u2019s call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site under Webcasts & Presentations. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net of tax gain on the sales of CGT and SCI positive earning drives us from electric margin, margin primarily due to base load review accurate increase and customer growth as well as the positive impact of the depreciation study will more than offset by the negative impact of weather on both electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business.", "Gas margins were also banned due to CGT operating for a month during the first quarter of 2015 before it was sold. Additionally, expected increases in O&M expenses in CapEx related items including interest in property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. The bottom of the slide you will note that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and increase to electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015, resulting in a $0.10 per share in a negative swing.", "Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-Adjusted Weather Normalized basis earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $28 per share compared to the $34 per share in the same quarter of 2015. As a reminder GAAP-Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the native tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI for the first quarter of 2015. Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure as gas margins weather normalized for the north and south Carolina gas business and the direct impact of abnormal weather on Georgia business is generally in significant on an annual basis.", "Now on Slide 5, I would like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis South Carolina Electric & Gas Company first quarter 2016 earnings were down $0.08 per share compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins principally is a result of abnormal weather in both periods, as well as higher O&M expenses and hard expenses related to our capital program included interest expense and property taxes.", "These decreases more than offset increases from the continued recovery of financing cost under the BLRA, customer growth in both the electric and gas business and the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates. PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.24 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth.", "SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA energy marketing and SCANA energy in Georgia set a decrease in first quarter earnings in $0.06 per share primarily due to lower through put attributable to abnormal weather during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2016 and higher transportation cost.", "On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported relatively flat earnings in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $44 per share in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $41 per share, GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS was down $0.03 due primarily to foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015.", "I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment, and we're pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories as evidence and milestone to invest approximately 380 million with the expectation of creating approximately 1300 jobs.", "At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence, and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5%. Our particular interest and testing to our stage strong economic growth almost 80,000 for 3.7% more South Carolina\u2019s are working today than a year ago.", "Slide 7 presents costumer growth in electric statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated business. SCE&G is electric business add a customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12-months ended December 31, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales are up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis.", "Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulator rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity.", "The earned return for the 12-months ended December 31, 2016 in the base electric business is approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our LDCs in South and North Carolina and if they earned ROV of the gas business for the twelve months ending March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. As of December 31, 2015 the 12 month earned return for SCE&G gas was 0.65%.", "Year-over-year we have recently filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition in the earned return in that business. This rate increase as a results of PSNC\u2019s need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to include pipeline in integrity management rider. This rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs.", "Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the Company's current estimate of New Nuclear spending through 2018, and is consistent with last quarter's call and the February quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC agreement that was announced in October 2015. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated New Nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30, to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.", "Slide 10 presents the transition payments information and an expected timeframe for our filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan.", "Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. The election of the fixed price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. It is unlikely these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continued to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50/50 debt and the equity basis.", "On Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized earnings guidance is $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share, with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over three to five years using a base of 2015 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS of $3.73.", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks Jimmy. I would like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the Consortium and PSC approved process. Slide 13 presents the settlement agreement outline that we have previously shown, Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December, and Fluor began work as a subcontracted construction manager for the New Nuclear construction-site on January 4. The craft employees transaction to Fluor on April 4.", "On slide 13 presents cost as of the settlement date and our next quarterly BLRA update filing to be filed in the next couple of weeks, we plan to update the project cost for estimated change orders primarily related to items listed in Exhibit C of the settlement agreement. As in their recall Exhibit C described items net results and net settlement.", "On slide 14, several of those items for which we now have estimated the cost. Also listed of the estimated change orders associate with escalating the software and documentation necessarily to complete the project and new change orders initiated since the settlement that are owner a directed. Additional sales tax which has been excluded from the fixed price option is also listed.", "Slide15 presents the relative schedules of both filing of update attrition and the annual request for revised rates. We continue our analysis of the fixed price option and we will consider any input receive from Fluor. As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed price option.", "Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. We continue to expect to reach a conclusion on the matter sometime during the second quarter and expect to have a minor delay of a few weeks in filing our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in order to coordinate the petition with the revised rates application.", "Moving on to some of the activities at the New Nuclear construction-site, Fluor\u2019s integration into the project as Westinghouse's subcontracted construction manager continues to progress with the placement of managers in key positions of the construction areas and a series of the sessions for the taking place to streamline processes and improved performance.", "Slide 16 present an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. This photo gives you the view of the layout of the site and labeled both Units 2 & 3, as well as many other areas of the construction site.", "Slide 17, presents a schematic view of the five large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA01 through CA05 fit spatially inside the containment vessel. As you will recall we have now placed CA01, CA04 and CA05 for Unit-2 and CA04 for Unit-3.", "Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit-2 containment. Looking down into the containment vessel you see the first ring section with openings of penetrations sitting on top of the lower bowl. As previously mentioned, CA01, CA04, and CA05 have been placed and conditioning in the picture.", "Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit-2 CA02 module. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the unit containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned in previous quarters CA02 is now structurally complete and awaiting installation.", "Slide 20 shows a picture of the Unit-2 CA03, which is the west wall of the unit containment refueling water storage tank. Fabrication continues as all 17 of CA03 sub-modules are on-site and standing on the summary platform.", "Slide 21 shows a picture of the first portion of the Unit-3 module CA20 which was placed during March. This module consist of four sub-assemblies and the decision was made to expedite placement of sub-assemblies three and four as they are allowed for to work to move forward that is required in order to begin shield building erection which is the next critical path item.", "As you can see on slide 22, fabrication continues on sub-assemblies one and two inside of the module assembly building or MAB. All 72 require sub-modules are on-site, these remaining sub-assemblies will placed once they get completed. As a reminder CA20 has an auxiliary building module that which is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel.", "Slide 23, shows a picture of the Unit-3 containment vessel Ring-1 placement and one is placed on top of the containment vessel lower bowl on April 13.", "Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit-3 module CA05 which module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication of the Unit-3 CA05 has been completed and has been stretched outside of the MAB.", "Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit-3 module CA01. Module CA01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 24 of the 47 sub-modules on-site, seven of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together in the MAB.", "Now we will turn the slide number 26, I want to briefly mention that last week in public service commission of South Carolina approved SC&Gs request to release its electric rated to reflect lower fuel cost. Heading at balance and diversified few mix contributes to lower fuel cost that we passed on to our customers. It is anticipated that this decrease should more than offset and in increase to residential customers from the BLRA for the year.", "Finally please now turn the slide number 27, discuss some of the SC&Gs solar initiatives. Under South Carolina Law or Act 236 we are allow to recover certain cost associated with our efforts to implement the renewable energy incentive programs. We officially rolled out our DEO program and all this of 2015 with goal of adding approximately 84 megawatts of our new module generating facilities to our system by the end of 2020. We anticipate minimum a half way to our 2020 goal by the end of 2016.", "That concludes our prepared remarks and I\u2019ll be glad to respond any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jim von Riesemann at Mizuho Securities.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Hi, Jimmy. Hello? Jimmy? Jimmy? Hello.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hi is that better?", "Jim von Riesemann", "That's a lot better. I can hear everybody now. Let me just ask the elephant in the question room. There's been a lot of these conflicting signals in the marketplace about Toshiba and investors are obviously expressing some concern here. So with that being said, how does the fluidity of their situation affect your calculus with potentially accepting the fixed price option?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well we are certainly monitoring situation to the extent that we can get public information about it. I think the things that are important for our consideration are unlike the previous contract where we had certain calendar based payments in the newer range we are only paying for work completed. So we should be in a good a total of cash flow situation comparative to the work completed and not the behind or ahead on the cash payment at any point in time from here though with the completion.", "So it\u2019s really progress payments are in line with the work they just completed. We also very focused on next six months, we have six more months where we have to make that decision and while we likely follow before them, we don\u2019t have make the technical election with Toshiba until that point. So we plan monitor the situation off-course they have taken some actions already on disclosing some of the noncore assets. They said that this business is core to them and they have back end up the decisions I made at this point so, it\u2019s obviously done in a general we\u2019re going to continue to monitor it over the next several months.", "Jim von Riesemann", "It's safe to say that you're not worried, though, is that what I'm hearing you saying?", "Jimmy Addison", "I mean no, it\u2019s certainly something we are monitoring it, we\u2019re paying attention to it, - but it\u2019s I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a worry no?", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. And did I hear Steve correctly, so you're going to delay the BLRA filing maybe until mid-June and at that time you'll give us either a strong signal, or you will have decided which option you're going to choose, is that correct?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes John we think we\u2019ve made our decision as we said before in the second quarter, we anticipate the filling for both in the second quarter, we just want to make sure that we a line one filling with the other, there is slightly different time frames, the update petition has by lower six-months before decision has to be lender by the public service commission, the annul be our right filing is a five-month time frame so we don\u2019t want, we would like not to be aligned with each other.", "Jim von Riesemann", "I get it. Okay. And then finally, on the equity question, how should we think about incremental equity, is that really one half the difference between, say, the amended EPC price and the fixed price option if you go that way?", "Jimmy Addison", "You know our strategy hasn\u2019t changed and that\u2019s correct we expect the finance roughly half and half with debt and equity between the two. What we don\u2019t know at this point is when we\u2019ll need it if we go that direction, it\u2019s got a way to sort out the progress payment schedule.", "Jim von Riesemann", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Weinstein of UBS.", "Michael Weinstein", "Hi guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good afternoon.", "Michael Weinstein", "Hi. With trailing 12-months weather adjusted retail kilowatt hour sales at about 1.3% now, for the last six-months, can you just remind us again, what is the guidance for 2016, and at what point would you consider increasing it because of this?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well the guidance as it relates to sales growth. So, our overall plan was for slightly negative like just slightly below flat for the year compared to 2015 on a weather normal basis. So we\u2019re not at the points, we\u2019re too concerned about that yet as far as its impact on EPS, we had a very mild first quarter obviously $00.10 in the electric business quarter-over-quarter so we\u2019re not at any position here to consider revising that at this point.", "Michael Weinstein", "And when you guys report or when you guys guide to $3.90 to $4.10, that's weather normalized guidance for the entire year, not just from this point forward, right?", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s right.", "Michael Weinstein", "Okay. So you intend to report whether you've achieved that guidance weather normalized at the end of the year, despite mild weather.", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s correct and the reason we\u2019re not making change at this point is we are only three-months into the year, so we've got substantially amount in front of us now, you know if we get three quarters through the year and we are in that situation and it might be a different discussion.", "Michael Weinstein", "Got you. And one last question. On slide 14, the additional costs since the settlement agreement. So this would be in addition to the $288 million additional cost, right? This would be $56 million above that, and $66 million above the fixed price option incremental, right?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes Mike that essentially correct from we signed our deal with Westinghouse in October, we had attached an Exhibit we call Exhibit C that had some things that we\u2019re working on that would be hadn\u2019t yet resolved and we\u2019re not resolved with this agreement so a bulk of what we see here is IMs that we've now resolved from that agreement or that Exhibit.", "Michael Weinstein", "And I know there's been some confusion out there over the performance bond that you have with Westinghouse. I'll just give you an opportunity now to explain it to everybody in case you still are getting phone calls on it.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes I don\u2019t know we've had much of an enquiry about the thing, but we\u2019ve got the provisions out there basically to protect us on a in the short-terms it\u2019s relates to working capital. If they were to the default and had not paid a sub or something like that and we had to pick that work up through someone else, pay the sub that kind of thing, the formula is to help in the transition just based on quarterly projected payment for the year.", "Michael Weinstein", "Right. So it's basically a bond that's intended to finance a transition, more or less.", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s right.", "Michael Weinstein", "In case you need it. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steven Byrd, Morgan Stanley.", "Stephen Byrd", "Hi good afternoon.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good afternoon Steven.", "Stephen Byrd", "Just wanted to check in with you all on the status of the Sandman project in China, just your latest thinking in terms of how that's progressing.", "Jimmy Addison", "Steven we think that that\u2019s progressing fairly according to their latest finance plans, we anticipate that they are getting close to doing the cool hydro so there we have to - cooling pumps have been installed which was the last thing that they are waiting for Sandman at Unit-1. Their plan calls for them to load fuel yet this year so sometime probably in the lat - early fourth quarter and then testing from that point is really up to the utility. So it\u2019s less in Westinghouse hands than it is the utility\u2019s hands, but certainly sometime we think early next year I\u2019m not sure of going commercially is the appropriate term from China, but that will be on grade making power.", "Stephen Byrd", "Great. That's all I had. Thank you, very much.", "Operator", "The next question is from Feliks Kerman at Visium Asset Management.", "Feliks Kerman", "Hi, guys. Most of my questions have been asked. But if the you guys can talk a little bit about the pipeline integrity program you guys have asked for, what is the size, the scope? How long do you expect that program to last for?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes so it's in our capital that we disclosed there for the three-years, there is a good bit of integrity management related in that entire CapEx period over the next three-years and I suspect it could be some beyond that too, but roughly about 50% of that CapEx is related to integrity management in 2016 from 2018. Some of that would be picked up with the midyear CWIP in the rate base so we will get half of the year when we actually have the discussions with North Carolina Commission staff in the middle of year. So we will basically have the remaining half of 2016 and 2017 and 2018. But roughly half of it relates to integrity management.", "Feliks Kerman", "Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "The next question is from Travis Miller at Morningstar.", "Travis Miller", "Hi, thank you. You answered most of my clarifying questions on the nuclear stuff, BLRA, et cetera. Wondering on the gas side, obviously, you had really strong customer growth, was wondering what that was doing to gas usage and also then the next step to gas margins at those businesses.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes well Travis, two LDCs at - they really get handle through mechanisms in different ways, so in North Carolina there is the decoupler that handles unit change in consumption and weather et cetera. And then it doesn\u2019t have a rate base for just what we have rate case that we filed there now. In South Carolina we have the rate stabilization Act which is basically a streamlined rate review that happens after every heating season at the end of March and if there is more than 50 basis points variance and its adjusted in November. So it's really a consider through both of those mechanism even though they differ a little in their process.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. And then that customer growth, we see that kind of 2.5% type rate, does that mean substantial investment opportunity, either distribution or other value chain parts, over the next couple of years in addition to what you've already planned?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes well I would say - not I wouldn\u2019t say a lot more than what we've planned, so what we've got in the plan now contemplates it. so in North Carolina and South Carolina they are differ somewhat. In South Carolina we own very little of the transmission system of course we used to own more of it through a different subsidiary, but we sold that a year ago. There is still some transmission in the South Carolina Electricity & Gas, gas system, but it's not a tremendous amount.", "But it\u2019s certainly distribution growth there in the South Carolina system, but that\u2019s not a significant amount above and beyond the depreciation that applies to that business each year. In North Carolina it\u2019s a different story, but also significant transmission enhancements that are going on, actually bids that go into those projects a couple of weeks ago and it\u2019s a significant pipeline investment that\u2019s going on, and its going extremely well, the majority of its own existing right away in West and North Carolina.", "Travis Miller", "Okay and that could be the distribution investment options.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes I mean the majority of this is related to growth in the territory, the areas we serve are going very well. A lot transmission enhancement in the next couple of years will be up in research triangle area too in additional to West or North Carolina, because a lot of the industrials are really going for example research universities all are going to complete gas supply as appose to other fuels. So I don\u2019t know there is tremendous new frontier kind of distribution opportunities, but I think there is a lot of industrials are really pushing it. Gas fired or electric generation too.", "Travis Miller", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins", "Good afternoon.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hi Dan.", "Dan Jenkins", "I was wondering if you could give a little color on the, you had the $0.04 year-over-year for O&M, and I was wondering, what's driving that? Is that timing, or is that something that's going to continue on a comparison basis going forward?", "Jimmy Addison", "No it's fairly consistent with our internal budget it is a little more lumpy there in the first quarter, we don\u2019t expect to benefit that significant throughout years. The most significant thing is we've made compensation adjustments in the middle of the first quarter, so you have got some of that coming through and also the incentive base compensation the part is driven by - that\u2019s driven of share price has obviously been more than we had expected and I guess that a high class problem to have with the stock performing pretty well especially in superior group over the last quarter.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then, I think you mentioned on the nuclear, that the current critical path item is the shield building, and I know that you note in your report that you filed in February, that was mentioned there as well. I was just wondering if you could update us on the status of that in terms of the components that are being fabricated and so forth?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes Dan the shield building is going probably better we had anticipated, our concern for the shield building really came from the contractor, their concerns at the time that was try to bridge an iron, now Fluor has taken over, but we still retained the CB&I services crew it that is doing that welding. So even though CB&I Power existed the consortium the CB&I services folks who are doing the curtailment vessel welding and the shield building welding stay and they are doing tremendous job.", "There is about 16 courses of this steel that goes up to form a shield building, usually a course at a time welded together then fill course with concrete. So we've got to three those courses that have been placed welded and filled with concrete, the fourth course has been placed, it\u2019s being welded did, we anticipate filling that with concrete sometimes in the next couple of weeks.", "The deliveries are coming in from an entity called Newport News Industrial, NNI in Virginia. And those folks are working very hard to meet out schedule and we\u2019re looking at diversifying that supply chain a little but perhaps moving some of those modules to another vendor to free up a little bit of space at NNI. So over, I would say the shield building is going a little better than we expected.", "Dan Jenkins", "How many of those components are you still waiting on with the shield building?", "Jimmy Addison", "I wound say it is for the first Unit-2 we've probably get two-third of the shield building panels that we need and for the trailing unit, Unit-3 we probably only have about a third of them and so we are still waiting on about two-thirds.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay and then on Unit-3 what\u2019s the current critical path item for that unit?", "Jimmy Addison", "It runs through the shield building as well Dan. So it\u2019s still shield building, either you know we\u2019re talking about it, it runs through shield building.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. Okay that\u2019s all I had. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates", "Paul Patterson", "Good afternoon.", "Steve Byrne", "Hello Paul.", "Paul Patterson", "How are you doing?", "Steve Byrne", "Great. How about it.", "Paul Patterson", "I'm managing, I guess. Just wanted to ask you about the fixed price option, and if you were to select that, what the impact is in terms of does it change the way the payments would go? Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that?", "Steve Byrne", "Paul from payment prospective Jimmy lead to early, we\u2019re changing the way that we make the payments here to Fluor, we've had payments based on either hitting milestone or what we call progress payments. Progress payments is a bit of miss number really what we try to actual progress so we changed that and when we go forward, you\u2019re negotiating a milestones payment schedule so the construction milestone payment schedule which will have us paying only for milestones achieved.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. I guess what I'm wondering is in terms of the, you guys have not decided on whether or not you're going to go for the fixed price option, is that correct?", "Steve Byrne", "That\u2019s correct", "Paul Patterson", "If you were to go for it, does that change the payments, or does that change the schedule in payments, do you pay anything up front, or is it pretty much the same way? Would you be paying over the same time frame pretty much the same amount with this milestone? That's it.", "Steve Byrne", "Yes so for what we done as we get an estimate for what is the non-fix price option if we select the fix price option there is an added cost that comes with taking that risk away if you will and so I\u2019ll do as well just take that additional cost it will be stretched out over the entire project, so it\u2019s if they want that should be front loaded or just picking the milestones which indicate we\u2019re progress will attach payments to those milestones and when the over it has six milestone will make payments even but the additional cross just gets spread out over the remainder of the project.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Next question is from Andy Levi at Avon Capital.", "Andrew Levi", "I guess I'm just going to go back to Toshiba. I want to get something clarified. Because if you were to choose the fixed cost option, which seems to be the right way to go, and obviously, you got rid of CBI, so that was a very good thing that you guys did and have Fluor in there. But given Toshiba's continued financial issues and concern about the Company's, or our concerns and I guess sell-side analysts concerns about the long-term viability of the Company, can you tell us what type of protections you have in place to protect SCANA and the summer project from Toshiba's potential insolvency relative to the fixed cost contract and their ability to execute on that? And then can you get more into also the surety bond that you have, the amount that you have and how that would work if you had to call on that. Because we saw with Portland General having to call on their surety bond with Abengoa, it just wasn't that simple. Thank you.", "Steve Byrne", "Okay Andy its Steve. Let me start now I\u2019ll let Jimmy to finish maybe a little bit on the surety bond, but surety bond [indiscernible] earlier was there really to create kind of a soft landing. So it would pay vendors that were in process and allow us to in a systematic logical fashion one project down to the point where Toshiba or Westinghouse could exit. Now we\u2019re presuming some kind of insolvency or bankruptcy you would also have to presume that Westinghouse doesn\u2019t survive that.", "And so as a with that provision and as you are aware there can be various kinds of bankruptcy and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t necessary mean that the contractor stops working. So we\u2019re working hard to make sure that we\u2019re not in advance of payments and then we have information that includes source codes, software and proprietary design information that\u2019s being escrowed and the bankruptcy or insolvency would be one of the triggers that gives me that information and then we would look to finish plan on our own.", "We could do that one of the couple of ways, we could either act as our own general contractor, which will be more comfortable now than when we originally signed up for the projects since we've made some of the progress and we understand that this construction progress. And we would go out and get a subcontracted construction under, presumably Fluor since they are already on site, already familiar with means and method and know the project or we could EPC it again.", "So we could give it to an EPC contractors, certainly Fluor would in a good position, they are an EPC contractor. So we could give it to them. So the important part to me is that I have the information that I need to be able to finish the plant on my own and that's the whole reason why we're escrowing.", "Andrew Levi", "But I guess the issue that I see, though, is that, I guess the thing that was a big positive was this fixed cost contract, right, because it kind of eliminates certain downside above the $500 million escalation in the cost of the contract. And so, if that contract is with an entity that is not a good counterparty, that fixed cost contract is not really worth a lot I guess. That's what I'm really getting at is, not as much the ability to finish the plant or the construction aspect of it, but the ability to control the cost if, in a negative case, Toshiba doesn't have the money to pay above the $500 million escalation that you're willing to pay in a fixed cost option.", "Steve Byrne", "As I said earlier Andy what we have on our side though is some time to watch out the progress and to see how that going. We've got another six-months before we get to make this call. They have said publically that this business is one of three key areas of focus for them and they are shedding the other businesses. They brought $6.5 billion well as soon as the sales close here shortly. Everything they have said they are going to do it appears they have done at this point in a very efficient manner. So we've got several more months to watch this and monitor the situation.", "Andrew Levi", "I just get concerned because I see the stock trading a little over $1. Just on the surety bond, could you just go over that and the amount of that and how that would work and who would be paying you?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, so it\u2019s actually it can be either an surety bond or in letters of credit, we've allowed them to provide that through letters of credit and we are comfortable with the counter parties there and it is an annual calculation based upon the estimated quarterly payments in the next year. So we've made that calculation for 2016, we've elected it and those letters of credit are in place now.", "Andrew Levi", "And who's the letter of credit with? Is it funded the letter of credit? How does that work?", "Steve Byrne", "It\u2019s a letter of credit in case they default on any of the provisions.", "Andrew Levi", "That's for $100 million, is that for $100 million?", "Steve Byrne", "It\u2019s that a maximum of $100 million based upon the projected cash flows of the year that\u2019s applicable and so it will change each year.", "Andrew Levi", "And then as far as on the creditor side, because Southern also has a fixed cost contract according to them, I mean, who would get paid first? I guess we don't know, that right? Because Southern would have the same issue.", "Steve Byrne", "No, no, no its I mean - well this is\u2026", "Andrew Levi", "I don't mean on the surety bond. I'm talking about as far as the ability for Toshiba to perform on a fixed cost contract.", "Steve Byrne", "I can\u2019t answer that.", "Andrew Levi", "Alright. Okay. Thank you, very much.", "Operator", "Next question is from Claire Tse at Wolfe Research.", "David Paz", "Hi, actually it's David Paz. Just a quick question on your long-term growth rate. What earned ROEs are you assuming both at the SCE&G business and the PSNC business.", "Steve Byrne", "Yes so at SCE&G, David, we're consistent on the base business at above 9%, is our strategy to stay out of any base rate increases outside of the BLRA and the BLRA of course is at 10.5%, and PSNC we've got a current allowed 10.6%.", "David Paz", "Okay. So even in the PSNC case, we should think about, even though rate base growing faster than in the past, you still anticipate somewhere in that mid 10 earned ROEs through the period of your long-term growth rate?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well that\u2019s for 10.6 in the case, we will have to wait and see how that situation comes out either through negotiations or through hearing with the Commission, but we'll he know that in another - within six-months.", "David Paz", "Okay. And then also, with respect to your growth rate, what sales growth are you assuming through that period? On the electric side.", "Jimmy Addison", "It's above 1.2%.", "David Paz", "1.2%. Okay. That's a CAGR?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "David Paz", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Andrew Weisel at Macquarie Group.", "Andrew Weisel", "Thank you. Just want to clarify timing of this nuclear fixed option, if you do exercise it or not. It seems to me like there are a couple different steps here, I just want to understand when we can expect each and what order. So you're going to make a decision. You're going to file with regulators. You're going to tell us about it. And you're going to officially exercise the option with the contractors. Is that the right order? And what might the time line of those four pieces look like?", "Steve Byrne", "Andrew, what we say is, we are going to make that decision sometime in the second quarter, then we will file between the filing and the public service commission rendering an opinion is six-months, and intervening six-months we will file testimony. There will be testimony filed from any interveners, and then we will have a hearing, which will be a public hearing. We have until November 1, to let Westinghouse whether we have opted for that fixed price option. And we can do that basically any time from now until November 1.", "Jimmy Addison", "And I would just add, we are going to let you know exactly concurringly what the time we file.", "Andrew Weisel", "Okay. So, the filing could come very shortly after you make your decision, and that process can be underway by the time you officially exercise the option with Westinghouse?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, I would think that it would be well underway, before we officially exercise the option with Westinghouse, because the option with Westinghouse is subject regulatory approval.", "Andrew Weisel", "Right. Good point. And then, in terms of updating the CapEx and financing costs, would that update come only in the next quarterly earnings call, or potentially when you announce to us that you've made a decision and are filing with regulators one way or the other?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, so there is two different moving parts there, one is which option do we go with just amend the contract or to go with the fixed option. The second moving part to that is getting the revised payment schedule worked out between us and the contractor. So those two don't necessarily happen at the same time, so it may be that we are in a position and make the filing and notify you of which option we have chosen but haven\u2019t yet completely agreed on the payment schedule. So we can't completely update the CapEx schedule until we get both of those done.", "Andrew Weisel", "What's the latest time that you would get the updated finance, or payment schedule, rather?", "Jimmy Addison", "I don\u2019t know a firm answer on that because it could be that we have to use this option as the - I don\u2019t know this, but it could be we have to use its resolution board to resolve any differences we have there. So that could add some time on the end of it, but I would hope all of that \u2013 Steve is it reasonable to say we hope to get all of that done this year?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, absolutely.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes.", "Andrew Weisel", "Alright great, looking forward to your decision. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Feliks Kerman at Visium Asset Management", "Feliks Kerman", "Hi, just to clarify on that last question, because the petition process takes six months for approval, is it fair to say that the associated increased equity needs would come more like a 2017 item at the end of the petition, or more of an upfront related issuance? Any color on the timing?", "Jimmy Addison", "We don\u2019t know anything of this point, this is we need any equity until 2017 at the earliest. Recall we sold these two subsidiaries last year, realized about $425 million plus of cash after tax from that. So in the short-term, we've used that to defray some debt, but we have got plenty of that to sustain us through the 2015.", "Feliks Kerman", "And that's even if you choose the fixed-price option?", "Jimmy Addison", "Excuse me 2016. Again, I don\u2019t know what the revised payments schedule is going to be so we just don\u2019t have that at this point. So we would have to have that but nothing we know at this point says we've got anything additional related to that. As Steve said earlier, we are planning on paying the - if we elected the fixed price we would pay that ratably over the remaining life remaining life of the construction, it's not a lump payment.", "Feliks Kerman", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Well thank you and we will look forward to finalizing this decision on the fixed-price option and the subsequent petition to be filed with the PSC. We continue to focus on our new nuclear construction and on operating all of our businesses in a safe and reliable manner. And we thank you for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ", "Susan Wright", "Thank you and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2016. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and Steve will provide an update on our restoration efforts after Hurricane Matthew and our new nuclear project. After our comments we will respond to your questions. ", "Please note that the presentation slides referred to during the call are only available through our webcasting service until the Q&A session begins. When our Q&A session starts, the full presentation will be available at SCANA.com in the webcast and presentation sections of the investor webpage. ", "Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear projects and other investor information directly to our website at SCANA.com. On SCANA's homepage, there is a yellow box containing links to the nuclear development and other investor information sections of the website. It is possible that some of the information that we post directly to our website may be deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. You can sign-up for email alerts under the investor section of SCANA.com to notify you when there is a new posting in the nuclear development and/or other investor information sections of the website. ", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as shown on slide 2. The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ", "Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. The required Reg G information can be found in the investors section of our website under webcasts and presentations. ", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy. ", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Susan and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on slide 3. Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.32 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a baseload review act rate increase, customer growth and extremely hot weather in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter last year. As an example Charleston, South Carolina, one of our largest metropolitan areas, registered their hottest month on record in July. ", "Results also improved due to increased gas margins. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2015, SCE&G adopted new depreciation rates for an electric plant as a result of a study. These new rates which produced an annual decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $29 million, were effective as of January 1, 2015, resulting in the application of three quarters' worth of depreciation savings being applied during the third quarter of 2015. Additionally, increases in O&M, interest and property taxes had a net negative impact on earnings. ", "At the bottom of the slide you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share during the third quarter 2016 and $0.11 per share in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in a positive $0.16 per share impact to earnings quarter over quarter. ", "Slide 4 shows earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $3.29 per share versus $4.53 per share in 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI. Otherwise, power electric margins, due primarily to a baseload review act rate increase, customer growth and the positive impact of abnormal weather year to date would have resulted in improved comparative results. ", "These increases were partially offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O7M and CapEx related items, including depreciation, interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share for the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 and $0.22 per share for the same period of 2015, resulting in a favorable $0.05 per share impact to earnings. ", "Now on slide 5, I would like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's third quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.26 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to a higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth, in addition to abnormally hot weather. ", "These items were partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses, as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest depreciation and property taxes. Year to date SCE&G's earnings were up by $0.20 per share in 2016 over the same period of 2015. ", "PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.04 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense and depreciation related to the expansion of PSNC Energy's system. For the nine months ended September 30, earnings were down $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period in 2016. ", "SCANA Energy provided a $0.02 per share increase in third quarter earnings over the previous year, primarily due to higher margins during third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. ", "SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the nine-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.10 per share in 2016, compared to earnings of $1.32 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. ", "I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory, on slide 6. We're pleased by the continued economic growth in our service territories, as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.2 billion with the expectation of creating approximately 4,600 jobs. ", "At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and SCE&G's electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 4.9%, as is the estimated rate in SCE&G's electric territory. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 56,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. ", "Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. As you can see, the rates are trending fairly consistent over the year. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. Overall, weather normalized total retail sales were basically flat on a 12 months ended basis. ", "Now please look at slide 8 which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $10.6 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. ", "In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we were allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016 in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-DORA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. ", "Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the baseload review act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition revised this allowed ROE down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates which applied to the request that was approved last week and will become effective in November. ", "Under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement with the ORS and four other interveners and which Steve will discuss in more depth shortly, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective requests for revised rates beginning in 2017, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. ", "As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below that allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the rate stabilization act. ", "As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band and we filed for an annual increase in mid June. The Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of $4.1 million in September, with rates going into effect with the first billing cycle of November. As you are also aware, during the first quarter 2016 we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition and the earned returns in that business. In late August PSNC Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the Public's staff and we expect a decision from the NCUC to be made some time shortly. ", "As part of the settlement agreement, PSNC Energy agreed to a $19 million revenue increase and an authorized ROE of 9.7%. In addition, the settlement agreement allows PSNC Energy to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. We estimate that slightly more than 20% of our CapEx over the next three years will be subject to this integrity management rider. The new rates associated would be effective beginning November 1, 2016. ", "Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the Company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed-price option spending, as represented in the ORS settlement agreement as filed September 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction milestone payment schedule, as it is still being addressed through the dispute resolution board process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented. At the bottom of the slide we recap the estimated new nuclear equip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods in which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. ", "Next, on slide 10, I would like to mention a recent tax election we made to claim Section 174 research and experimentation deductions for some of our new nuclear costs. After evaluating this section of the tax code, including recent court decisions and recently issued final regulations and after obtaining extensive external advice, we concluded that the regulations allow application of Section 174 research and experimentation deductions to our AP1000 units as a pilot model. We first claimed these deductions on our 2015 return which was filed last month and plan to make similar claims on our prospective returns. ", "Essentially, this code section allows a current tax deduction for certain costs incurred in the year they are incurred rather than waiting to receive the deduction through accelerated or bonus tax depreciation once the units are placed in service. By claiming these deductions as costs are incurred we will forgo the depreciation deduction later. ", "In short, it functions much like bonus depreciation in that the deduction is simply accelerated, although in this case it is accelerated and is realized as the money is spent rather than at the time the units are placed into service. This election will result in an increase in available cash in the near term and will therefore lessen the need for debt and equity issuances. This should benefit customers in several ways and also benefit existing shareholders through lower dilution. While the exact amounts are not completely known we have estimated the impact by year through 2018. ", "While at a minimum customers will benefit from the impact of this cash source in the form of enhanced credit metrics supporting credit ratings, these deductions will also result in accumulation of a deferred tax credit. Deferred taxes are not contemplated by the BLRA law and will therefore be associated with our base electric business as a reduction to rate base. As such, we have proposed to the ORS that, as this credit to retail electric rate base bills and our resulting retail earned returns increase, we will also flow back benefits directly to customers through a credit or decrement rider to base electric rates. ", "We also plan to propose this to the PSC in an accounting petition for their approval. This strategy does not change the timing or amounts of the BLRA revised rate increases for the remainder of the new nuclear construction. ", "We believe this decrement rider treatment will allow us to offset some of the BLRA rate increases our customers will see during the peak construction years. Additionally, it allows for market ROEs [ph] for our shareholders consistent with our stated strategy of earning a reasonable return on the base business, while avoiding rate increases other than those associated with the BLRA. We do not project this election and proposed treatment will change our earnings guidance, as lower dilution and the rate decrements essentially offset one another from an EPS perspective. ", "Now please look at slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This plan has been updated to reflect our results year to date, with the election of the fixed-price option as well as the expected impact of the section 174 deductions. Note that we have completed all of our planned financings for 2016. ", "As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans until we have incremental equity needs which we currently estimate to be in 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts when the timing is presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses and may change based upon the outcome of the petition filing, the dispute resolution board and the actual achievement of milestones. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50/50 debt and equity basis. ", "On slide 12 we're reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share, with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over three to five years, using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. ", "We plan to address 2017 earnings guidance on the fourth quarter call after the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule and the conclusion of the petition process. ", "I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project. ", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy. On slide 13 you can see a photo of Hurricane Matthew making landfall on the South Carolina coast almost a year to the date of the historical flooding that happened in South Carolina in 2015. I would like to thank those of you who reached out and appreciate your thoughts and prayers for those were affected by this storm and in some cases are still trying to recover from last year's flood. I would also like to thank our linemen, tree crews and support staff, as well as those were dispatched from other areas as far away as Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi. Immediately following the impact of the storm we had approximately 290,000 customers who reported outages. Within 48 hours, we had restored power to 190,000 and in 72 hours had restored power to 250,000 customers. Restoration was complete within eight days. ", "Over the next few months, we will try to measure the Company's impact from the storm but it will not compare to the significant upheaval in the lives of those who were ultimately affected. ", "Please now turn to slide 14. I would like to discuss the petition that SCE&G has filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on May 26 of this year, seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule, as well as the capital cost schedule for the two new nuclear units. We're hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with the ORS and four other interveners related to the aforementioned petition. ", "This settlement agreement signifies that long-contested issues exist among the settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules. As Jimmy already mentioned, the settling the parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.25% from 10.5%, calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1 of 2017. In addition, SCE&G will not file for future requests to amend capital cost schedules until after January 28, 2019. ", "Slide 15 presents the relative schedule for the petition filing. We filed our direct testimony at the beginning of July and the ORS followed suit with their testimony and settlement agreement at the beginning of September. Our hearing with the PSC took place at the beginning of this month including after a minor delay due to Hurricane Matthew. The ORS presented the terms of the settlement agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than November 28. ", "Moving to some activities at the new nuclear construction site, slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the construction tabletop from June of this year. Here you can see the significant progress that has been made so far on the project. I have labeled both units two and three as well as many other areas of the construction site. ", "Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the five large structural or CA modules that were located inside the containment vessel. We've now placed all of the major CA modules for unit two, as we had previously placed CA 01, 03, 04 and 05 and have more recently placed CAO2. We have also placed CA 04 and 05 for unit three. ", "Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the unit two nuclear island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and the aforementioned structural modules, as well as the reactor vessel which was recently placed and which I will discuss more shortly. Outside of the containment vessel you can see the auxiliary building module, CA20 and the shield building which surrounds the containment vessel pillar. ", "Slide 19 shows a picture of unit two CAO2 module being placed back in early August. CAO2 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. ", "On slide 20 you see a picture of the unit two reactor vessel being placed. On August 30 this reactor vessel was placed on top of module CA04 inside the containment vessel. This is a significant milestone for our project as this is the first reactor vessel to be set in a new nuclear plant in the United States in more than 30 years. ", "Slide 21 shows the placement of the second half of unit three's module CA20 which is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, the first half of this module was previously placed in order to move forward with shield building erection. ", "Slide 22 shows a picture of the fabrication of the unit three module CAO1. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently all 47 submodules are on site and 44 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the module assembling building or MAB. ", "Slide 23 shows a picture of unit three module CA02 being fabricated in the MAB. Currently two of the five submodules have been upended and all five submodules are on site. ", "On Slide 24 you can see a photo of the unit two de-aerator being placed on the unit two turbine building in late August. We have previously shown pictures of this massive 140-foot long, 18-foot diameter component, as it was transported to the site by truck. This component purifies feedwater by removing developed gases. ", "Slide 25 shows the generator stator being lifted up to the unit two turbine deck. This is the stationary portion of the main generator and was set on Tuesday of this week. ", "Lastly, on slide 26, you can see the unit three turbine building where we placed the upper and lower sections of all three low-pressure turbine condensers in September.

The first question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Michael Weinstein", "Glad to hear that the storm recovery efforts are going well and my best wishes to everybody. The cash benefit from the R&D tax credit, the total you show there is $1.1 billion. Is that the total that you anticipate or were there further benefits in 2019 and 2020 through the construction period? ", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, these are the substantial benefits that are applicable to 2015 and forward that we would realize in cash. There are some substantial benefits in 2014 and earlier that would require amended returns and, frankly, we would not get the benefit of any cash from until the issue will resolve, so we have not delineated those here on this chart. But these are the substantial benefits that we expect to see a cash benefit from until the issue is resolved which we expect to take likely several years. ", "Michael Weinstein", "Do have an estimate for what the total benefit could be upon resolution? ", "Jimmy Addison", "The periods from the time we began the project up through 2014 -- and, let me clarify, 2015's return, as I said in the prepared remarks, was filed September 15, so that number is in the 2016 benefit. We're showing the year that the cash benefit would show up. So, 2014 and earlier could amount to an excess of $500 million on a comparable basis. ", "Michael Weinstein", "Okay. And how much nuclear rate base do you anticipate will be assigned to 10.5% ROE in 2015? And how much has already been assigned 11%? ", "Jimmy Addison", "The chart on page 8 shows our nuclear CapEx of about $4.2 billion and that includes some of all three. I don't know that I have it at my fingertips but we can break that down for you and the IR staff can provide that afterwards. So this includes some -- the majority is at the 11% and then would include some at the 10.5%, as well, that the new rates will be effective in December. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "So perhaps just to go back to this issue really quickly on taxes, just to clarify twofold. One, in terms of the impact, basically if you think about it in a bonus depreciation comparable way, this is effectively equal to the $125 million you previously forecast for 2017 equity issuance, give or take $0.04, cumulative through the forecast period here? ", "Jimmy Addison", "You're going to have to run that one by me again, Julien. I'm not following you. ", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "I just wanted to make sure I heard you guys right. When you discussed the negative earnings impact of recognizing the taxes, as you've just filed on a prospective basis, that is equal through the 2018 period to the reduction in equity issuance -- I.e., the less dilution that you would suffer, so the $125 million of equity. ", "Jimmy Addison", "Let me recap it. The positive benefit is obviously from less dilution and less interest related to debt that will not be issued, as well. Offsetting that would be when our returns increase on the base electric business because of the accumulation of this deferred tax credit reducing rate base. We're proposing to offset electric rates in the future, lower base electric rates to mitigate that. So, that would be the offset. ", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Right. And perhaps could you quantify, what's the reduction in rate base cumulatively through the 2018 period that you are showing? ", "Jimmy Addison", "It will be the amount of cash that's shown on here, so cash is what would be offset against rate base. ", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Okay, one for one, right? ", "Jimmy Addison", "Right. ", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "And then just separately, what's the status on the dispute resolution board? I suppose they gave you an update or there was a production of press release that said negotiations should continue. What is the latest, perhaps or why the continuation as such? ", "Steve Byrne", "This is Steve. The continuation was because we were really not in disagreement over the total amount and we were in general agreement on the milestones. The only disagreement was on timing. So, the dispute resolution board, this is the first issue that's come before them so they were getting up to speed on the project, as well on the parties. ", "They wanted to give us basically an extra month or so to see if we could reach agreement before they would hand one back to us. So, we're in discussions now with Westinghouse to see if we can come to an agreement and give that back to the dispute resolution board prior to them issuing a ruling to us. ", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "And then a last quick clarification here in terms of any risk of delay of the project, what's the status of the efforts to extend the PTC? And then, also, I suppose before, at least in the case of your peer who is pursuing this, I suppose if the project wasn't completed by 2020 there would also be a potential less qualification of bonus depreciation for the asset. But given the shift in tax recognition, is that also another implicit benefit or offset should there be a further delay? ", "Jimmy Addison", "That is an implicit benefit. We're essentially taking some of that, economically at least, earlier. The other implicit benefit we haven't really talked about or focused on to this point is that by moving this what would have been bonus depreciation or makers depreciation earlier, gives us more headroom to deal with PTCs down the road, in general. ", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Right, absolutely. And then where does that effort from a legislative process stand? ", "Steve Byrne", "We're not directly plugged into the effort. Our understanding is that it came out of committee favorably, that it may be taken up by the Congress shortly. That date is in the law so it would require a change in law to change the in-service date. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Travis Miller", "I was wondering on the petitions, the settlements and as it relates to both the capital cost and milestone revisions in the fixed-price option, what are the tracks there for those? You laid out pretty clearly that the petition was a capital cost adjustment and the milestones. What's the track look like for the fixed-price option and how closely related are those two? ", "Jimmy Addison", "Travis, do you mean timing wise? They were all part of the same settlement heard by the Commission and the same docket. So, we would expect all to be ruled on likely in the next 30 days. ", "Travis Miller", "Okay, so just one ruling on the whole thing. ", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. ", "Travis Miller", "Okay. And then the petition numbers would also include those updated numbers for the fixed costs. ", "Jimmy Addison", "That's right. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris Ellinghaus with Williams Capital. Please go ahead.", "Chris Ellinghaus", "Is the goal with the conversation with Westinghouse to meet the deadline for the resolution board? Are you optimistic you can meet that deadline? ", "Steve Byrne", "The resolution board has given us a deadline that is in about 10 days, I think it is, maybe a little less than that. Do I think we could? It really depends on how much both parties want to meet the deadline to avoid going back before that resolution board. I don't know that I would handicap what the odds are, but the goal for both sides is that we reach resolution and go back to the dispute resolution board with a resolution such that they don't have to issue us a ruling. Both sides are clear on that one. ", "Chris Ellinghaus", "Okay. Jimmy, it's not entirely clear on a couple of issues relative to the Section 174 discussion. I appreciate that you removed the 2017 dilution. One, this wasn't originally in your growth expectations, the selection of using the credit? ", "Jimmy Addison", "You are speaking of earnings growth? ", "Chris Ellinghaus", "Yes. ", "Jimmy Addison", "No, it was not and nor was the rate decrement rider which I referred to. And, as I said in the prepared remarks, they essentially offset each other from an earnings perspective. So, it really doesn't alter the earnings growth, our forecast. ", "Chris Ellinghaus", "Right. And particularly since you had a bit of a windfall in the third quarter, it's almost $40 million from weather, is there a chance that the 2018, after you've gone through the process with the Commission in terms of the decrement rider and having a really good third quarter, that there could be additional changes to the 2018 equity expectations? ", "Jimmy Addison", "As I also said, there's always a chance that those equity expectations could change. But I would say much more significant than that are likely due to the timing of the payment milestone schedule that we've been talking about with several questioners early. That's going to cause us to readjust our nuclear CapEx once that comes out and that's more likely to be a significant driver than anything else. Of course, that will be timing. ", "Chris Ellinghaus", "Okay. And one last thing -- as far as the PNC order goes, is there anything that's leading them to take the maximum time or is that just traditional regulator scheduling? ", "Jimmy Addison", "We haven't been in front of them in eight years, so we don't have a lot of experience there. But I would say that, from what I know, it more has to do with one intervener who did not settle, the North Carolina Attorney General and some back-and-forth between her and our attorneys with the Commission just clarifying some positions. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Paul Patterson", "Most of my questions have been answered. Just on sales growth, it seems that residential made a big change, the trailing 12 months versus last quarter. It's was up plus 2% and now it's only 0.3% or something. I've got to look at the numbers again. But it seemed like quite a big change. I was wondering -- this is the weather normalized, is what I'm talking about -- what happened? ", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, you have the numbers correct. I can't answer your question specifically. That's why we try to really look at these things over time to come up with any trend. One thing I will tell you is it's the hottest quarter that I remember in my career, my 25 years here at SCANA. As I have said to you before, there's not an exact science in separating the weather and the average usage. I wouldn't get too hung up on something to the 10th of a percentage in one quarter, with a quarter with this extreme weather. ", "Paul Patterson", "Right, but this is for the last 12 months, though. That's the reason why. I can understand, in the quarter things are a little bit wacky. it just seems like, if I might, this is a trailing 12 months and it seemed like it was a big delta. Let me ask you this -- is leap year in this number? ", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, it is. ", "Paul Patterson", "So, in other words it includes an extra day for that. ", "Jimmy Addison", "It does. ", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. And then, just in general, going forward, could you just refresh my memory as to what your retail sales growth is embedded in your numbers, your outlook? ", "Jimmy Addison", "For 2016? For longer term? ", "Paul Patterson", "Yes, longer term but 2016, whatever you have. ", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure, I will give you both. For 2016 it was virtually flat to just a slight negative that we'd expected overall for the year for 2016 in our plans that the $4, the $3.92 to $4.10 are based off of. Long term, in our IRP, we expect about 1.3% net and that's 1.6% gross, net of about 30 basis points of energy efficiency demand-side management. ", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. And that's over a ten-year period? ", "Jimmy Addison", "15, and a lot of that is being driven off of industrials, especially in the nearer term where we continue to have incredible economic growth here in South Carolina. So, that's driving it, as well. ", "Paul Patterson", "If we were to take that out, what would residential and commercial -- what are you guys just generally thinking about that? ", "Jimmy Addison", "We don't break the IRP down into those categories. It's really, therefore, planning for generation expansion. So, whether it's industrial or residential we've got to have the capacity there, so we really don't break it down over the long term by classes. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins", "First, your changes to the financing plan, you eliminated the issuance for this year and then increased the debt issuance for 2017 and 2018. Is that being driven more by just the construction payments requirements or is that the tax benefit or is it both? ", "Jimmy Addison", "It's both, but I would say more significantly the tax cash. ", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then I think you mentioned that unit three, you placed CA20 and did you say CA core? Is that correct? ", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, Dan, we placed the first half of CA20. We placed earlier in the year. The second half of CA20 we placed recently. The first half was in order so we could use it as framework to do other concrete pours to get moving with the shield building. But, yes, all sections of CA20 are now in place. ", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. So, what's the next critical path on that? Is it CA01 or is it the shield building? ", "Steve Byrne", "The critical path for both units now, after CA20 was set on unit three, the critical path for both units now runs through the shield building. The CA01 for unit three is not far off. But right now everything runs through the shield building from both units. ", "Dan Jenkins", "So, related to that, are you still waiting on some of the panels to get on-site for both units? ", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, Dan, still waiting for some panels. Nothing that's holding me up right now. We're through five courses of the shield building on unit two. I've got all the core sixes. We weld the panels that come in together and lift them in twos and place them. So I've got them all welded together and twos already, so those are all ready to go. And I've got the first couple of courses for -- in fact, I think I've got the first five or six courses -- the trailing unit, unit three. So, I am not waiting on construction for any of the panels. I still don't have all of them in, so some of the higher elevation panels are not in. But I'm not waiting on the panels or anything. ", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then I think in your last update report, there was also some discussion about Fluor maybe having some troubles in terms of staffing up for the evening shift or whatever. I wondered if you could update us on that. ", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, Fluor, when they first came in, identified the need to increase staffing and wanted to staff a full back shift or night shift because we'd been operating with a skeleton crew night shift or back shift up to that point. Initially they had some difficulty in hiring but I would say that they recently have rectified that. They are now adding net about 150 people a month. ", "They laid out a target when they got here to hire 1,200 people this year. They will probably exceed that total. So, now what they are doing is focusing on the specific craft discipline needs. So, if I hire 100 people that are all carpenters and I need welders, that doesn't do me any good. So, right now they are focusing on those craft that we need. The craft that we need are welders and fitters or rod busters for conduit. ", "So, they are doing a good job, they're trying some innovative things, implementing multilingual workforces, those kinds of things. So, we're very happy with what Fluor is doing for us. They've been very successful recently. ", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. So, that second shift then is pretty operational now? ", "Steve Byrne", "Second shift is up and running. It's not fully staffed. They would like to have probably 1,000 people on that second shift which would include the craft plus manual and supervision.

Can you just remind us, on your targeted capital structure, the targeted FFO metrics and what your dividend policy is again? ", "Jimmy Addison", "FFO, we want to obviously be above 13 to be able to maintain credit ratings. And I would say that obviously this cash benefit of the taxes you referred to has a substantial benefit there. So, we feel much better about that. The second part of your question? ", "Jim von Riesemann", "Maybe the targeted capital structure and then the dividend policy. ", "Jimmy Addison", "Dividend policy is 55% to 60% payout and we're about the middle of that now. So, we're in good shape there. ", "Jim von Riesemann", "Okay. And let's just go back to this slide 10 question. I'm trying to simplify everything you said. So, you get the cash benefit today, you get no rate base hit until the units are placed into service and the true up happens. Is that correct? Because you guys are basically, your BLRA is set up using quip? Is that right? ", "Jimmy Addison", "No, I don't think I've got that clear for you here. Let me start over there. You get the cash benefit today. Deferred taxes are not contemplated in the BLRA law. Therefore, it defaults over to the base electric business. ", "Even though it originates from the new nuclear spending, the deferred tax credit and the credit to rate base will apply to the rest of the electric business, if you will. So, if we did nothing on the rate decrement, our strategy to keep returns from 9% to 10.25% would grow over the 10.25%. ", "So, our proposal to the Office of regulatory Staff is to take those earnings that are above that band or beyond that band and pass those back to the customers through a base electric decrement that would coincide with the same timing that the BLRA increases occur through revised rates each year, basically at the end. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Greg Rice with Millennium. Please go ahead.", "Greg Rice", "I just wanted to follow-up on what Jim was talking about right there and the way this decrement rider is going to work. So, basically, as your earnings on the base business increase, because the rate base is decreasing, does this essentially mean that you will be earning that 10.25% because you will be refunding everything above the 10.25% to ratepayer through the rider? ", "Jimmy Addison", "We haven't been that precise yet with our discussions with the regulators, with the ORS. What we're proposing, what we've said all along is, if we're in that 9% to 10.25% range, we feel good about that, about what we're doing in the base business. ", "So, we're not paying it at 10.25% necessarily. But we're in discussions with them as long as we can stay in that range of 9% to 10.5%. And necessarily there's going to be a little bit of a timing issue here because we're going to need to see what did we earn and then pass it back on a prospective basis. I suspect we will be more down in that range, not at 10.25%. ", "You look at our track record and we've been earning right about 9.75%, 9.5%, this quarter 10.1% but was driven, about 50 bps, off of weather there. So, we've been in the 9.5%, 9.75% range and hopefully as we implement this we could be in that range prospectively. ", "Greg Rice", "Maybe you set a cap saying if you ever go above the 10.25% you'll end up refunding. Is that the way to think about it? It seems like you shouldn't be refunding anything if you are in a 9.5% band. ", "Jimmy Addison", "What we're doing here is trying to work which we always do, with our regulatory staff to do something reasonable with the customers. We're not trying to set up a mechanism that's completely mechanical, driven off the top of the 10.5%. We're trying to also mitigate the rate increases on the customer. The Blabs work real well. We recognize that and we want to share these cash benefits back. And, as I said, we don't really see it impacting our earnings guidance. So, that's why we propose what we have. ", "Greg Rice", "And then just on the nuclear spend, how much have you spent year to date on the project? ", "Jimmy Addison", "Year to date -- let's see if I have that nearby. I don't even know that I have that at my fingertips. I really don't have year to date spend here at my fingertips. ", "Greg Rice", "Not a problem. I can follow up afterwards. ", "Jimmy Addison", "I know we're estimating for the entire year to be around $950 million or so and I don't think we will be off that substantially. But I don't have the through September 30 number. ", "Greg Rice", "And I just wanted to confirm, for spend that's happening on a nuclear project after June 30, 2016 which everything before that would have gone in this last BLRA, would you be earning AFUDC earnings basically all the way through December of 2017 on that spend when you get the next BLRA increase? ", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. ", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks. ", "Jimmy Addison", "Thank you. We look forward to concluding the regulatory proceedings before the South Carolina and North Carolina Public Service Commissions and the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule. And, as a side note, we will be attending the LEI conference in a couple of weeks and hope to see many of you there. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 27, 2017. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Iris Griffin, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Iris Griffin", "Thank you and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other investor information directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA\u2019s homepage, there is a yellow box containing links to the new nuclear development and other investor information sections of the website. It is possible that some of the information that we post directly to our website maybe deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. You can sign up for e-mail alerts under the Investors section of scana.com to notify you when there are new postings in the nuclear development and other investor information sections of the website.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that maybe made during today\u2019s call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found either in the Investors section of our website under Webcast and Presentations or in the slides for this presentation.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Iris and thank you all for joining us today. I will begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the first quarter of 2017 were $1.19 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the same quarter of 2016. Increased electric margins primarily from a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as higher gas margins due to customer growth and rate increases at SCE&G and PSNC were more than offset by the impact of significantly milder weather when compared to the same quarter of last year. Additionally, positive variances in O&M and other income were offset by CapEx-related items, including depreciation and property taxes. In the footnote, you will notice that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.24 per share in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016, resulting in a negative $0.19 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter.", "Now on Slide 4, I would like to briefly review the earnings results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G\u2019s first quarter of 2017 earnings decreased versus the same quarter of 2016 due primarily to the aforementioned significantly milder weather, which was partially offset by increases in electric margins from the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA. Additionally, gas margins at SCE&G increased as a result of a rate increase and customer growth. PSNC\u2019s earnings saw increases versus the same period of the prior year due principally to customer growth and the rate increase. SCANA Energy\u2019s earnings decreased due to significantly milder weather in the first quarter of 2017 versus the same quarter of 2016.", "I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 5. Through the first quarter of 2017, company\u2019s announced plans to invest approximately $200 million, with the expectation of creating over 1,700 jobs in our North and South Carolina territories. At the bottom of this slide, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of March 2017 and 2016. South Carolina\u2019s unemployment rate is 4.4%. Attesting to our state\u2019s strong economic growth, over 50,000 or 2.5% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. The other states in which we have service territories, North Carolina and Georgia, continue to see stable unemployment rates of 4.9% and 5.1%, respectively. The Carolinas, and especially South Carolina, continue to be seen as a favorable place to do business. As businesses have grown and expanded, they have nearly saturated our state\u2019s workforce, giving way to all-time highs in workforce and employment numbers with little change to unemployment levels. This continued success in turn has been a key factor in our strong customer growth.", "On Slide 6, we present customer growth and electric sales statistics. The top half of the slide shows the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G\u2019s electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.6% respectively. We are pleased to continue to see strong customer growth in the region. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017. Sales were up over the previous 12-month period due to the abnormally hot summer, which offset the recent abnormally mild winter. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were relatively flat on a 12-month ended basis, consistent with our planned expectations.", "Please now look to Slide 7, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $11 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the box on the right, you will see SCE&G\u2019s base electric business in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The adjusted earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017 and the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher. This mitigates the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.", "Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. With the approval of our 2015 petition, the allowed ROE was revised down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates, which applied to the requests that went into effect at the end of November 2016. Under the terms of our most recent order, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for prospective requests for revised rates.", "As a reminder, we are allowed a return on equity of 9.7% and 10.25% on our gas LDCs in North and South Carolina respectively. As you will recall, in South Carolina, the rates for our gas business are set according to the Rate Stabilization Act. Under that mechanism, the ROE is evaluated annually. If the earned ROE for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside of a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, we file to adjust rates in June, with the updated rates, if approved, becoming effective in November. On the slide, we present the ROE as of December 31, 2016 as we prepare the information as of the end of this quarter for the RSA filing. For this 12-month period, the earned return for SCE&G Gas was 8.47%. In North Carolina, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for an annual $19 million revenue increase at PSNC Energy, which was effective on November 1, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, the 12-month earned return for PSNC Energy was 9.44%.", "Slide 8 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company\u2019s CapEx projections through 2019 and is consistent with last quarter\u2019s call. This forecast shows projected spending under the fixed price contract and does not include any revisions from our ongoing review of the new nuclear schedule and cost estimates. At the bottom of the slide, we have recapped the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.", "Now please turn to Slide 9 to review our estimated financing plan through 2019. This plan includes the expected impact of the Section 174 income tax deductions as well as debt and equity issuances and is also consistent with last quarter\u2019s call. As a reminder, during the interim transition and evaluation period for the new nuclear project, we are making weekly payments. The projected spend on the project during the interim period is relatively consistent with what has been forecasted in this financing plan. It is unlikely that these debt and equity issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes on our funding needs for planned project expenses. We will update this financing plan and the CapEx plan shown on the prior slide once we complete our evaluation of the path forward for the new nuclear construction project.", "On Slide 10, we are reaffirming our 2017 GAAP adjusted weather normalized earnings guidance range of $4.15 to $4.35 per share and our internal target of $4.25 per share. Our long-term GAAP adjusted weather normalized annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 years to 5 years using a base of 2016\u2019s GAAP adjusted weather normalized EPS of $3.97 per share.", "I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our new nuclear project.", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks Jimmy. I would like to start with a training program update. Last week, our maintenance, chemistry, radiological protection and engineering training programs gained initial accreditation from the National Academy for Nuclear Training. This is a multi-year endeavor and a significant achievement for the project. These training programs now join our operator programs which were previously accredited. I would now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 11 presents an aerial photo of the construction tabletop from the first quarter of 2017. From this view, you can gain perspective on the proximity of the units two and three to our operating unit one near the top of the picture. Unit one is currently in a routine maintenance and refueling outage and is on schedule.", "Slide 12 presents a schematic view of the five large structural or CA modules that are located inside the containment vessel. We have placed all of the major CA modules for unit two and have placed CA01, 04 and 05 for unit three. Slide 13 shows an aerial view of the unit two and unit three nuclear islands. The left side of the slide shows unit two. With the addition of the second containment vessel ring in February, you can no longer clearly see all of the large CA structural modules, which as I previously mentioned, have all been placed. Additionally, you can see the shield building and the containment vessel as well as CA20. Unit three is on the right side of the slide. You can see CA01, CA04 and CA05. Outside of the containment vessel, you can also see the CA20 and the shield building beginning to take shape.", "Slide 14 shows an example of the installation of a mechanical module. In this case, it is safety related Q223 module being lowered into the unit two containment vessel. This is a direct vessel injection or DVI wall skid, which is a part of the passive core cooling system. Slide 15 shows a picture of the unit three CA02 module inside of the module assembly building or MAB from earlier this year. This module has been completed and is awaiting placement. Slide 16 shows the unit three CA03 module in the MAB, where it is being fabricated. Currently, all 17 sub-modules have been assembled and the last few are being welded together.", "Slide 17 shows pictures of the placement of panels that make up the fifth course of the shield building for unit two. As you may recall, these panels are placed, welded together and filled with concrete. We currently have 150 of the 167 panels needed to complete the unit two shield building. Slide 18 shows the progress of the unit three shield building. We have placed, welded and filled the second course of the panels and 82 of the needed 167 panels of unit three shield building are on site.", "Slide 19 shows the placement of one of the nine roof trusses for the unit two turbine building. All nine have been installed and you can see in this picture the yellow overhead bridge crane that was placed last quarter and the progress that had been made since then. Slide 20 is a photo of the high pressure turbine lower casing being placed in the unit two turbine building. Each unit has three low pressure and one high pressure turbine. All lower outer casings have been placed for the three low pressure turbines. Final torquing and adjustments are being made before installing the lower inner casings for the low pressure turbines. Slide 21 shows the arrival of one of the two unit three steam generators that were received on-site in March. We now have all four of the steam generators for units two and three. Steam generators transfer heat from the reactor that convert water to steam needed to spin the turbine.", "Slide 22, before we open the call for questions from analysts, I would like to provide an update on the ongoing work that has been taking place during the interim transition and evaluation period. This slide outlines some of our options, but any path forward would need to satisfy the growing generation needs of our customers. Our goal is to reach a decision that balances the needs of our customers, our stakeholders and our company. We will continue to provide information and updates whenever possible about the decision.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Nick Campanella", "Hey, good afternoon. This is actually Nick Campanella on for Julien.", "Jimmy Addison", "Hello Nick.", "Nick Campanella", "Hi, I was curious if we could talk about the frontal guaranteed for a moment, based on where to be triggered, do we have any sense the cadence for those payments, i.e., would it lump-sum or rather spread out over a period of time?", "Jimmy Addison", "We really don\u2019t yet, that\u2019s yet to be determined. Of course first, we got to determine what the damages would be and then have some discussions around the timing.", "Nick Campanella", "Thanks. That\u2019s all I have for now.", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Travis Miller", "Good afternoon. Thank you. I was wondering if you could update us on the 30-day versus 60-day decision whether or not try to get the 60-day review period?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes. Travis, this is Steve. We are attempting to extend that interim assessment agreement that we have that expires at 30 days, which I think is tomorrow. As of right now and there is always a lot of last minute details to be taken care of, but we don\u2019t see any impediments at this point to having an agreement in place sometime by either later today or tomorrow.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. Any idea, would 60 days be enough, would another 30 or would you try another 60 days or\u2026?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes. I think our goal is to extend it for another 60 days.", "Travis Miller", "So a total of 90 days then?", "Steve Byrne", "That\u2019s correct.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. And then one other question related, the weather impact, how much of that\u2019s either $0.19 year-over-year or $0.24 versus normal, how much of that you get back or will get back through your various clauses that you have?", "Jimmy Addison", "Really none of that Travis, so that\u2019s just related to the electric business. The weather impact in the two LDCs in the Carolinas is really captured already within the quarter in the accounting. So the cash of it may be a little later but that\u2019s all captured in the accounting, so that $0.24 versus normal is all related to the electric business.", "Travis Miller", "Okay, very good. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Steve Fleishman", "Good afternoon. Couple of questions. So, the \u2013 you presented an update to the commission a week or two ago and did talk a little bit about some productivity issues. Now over time, I think there were some issues with people not showing up for training, could you maybe give more color on how that\u2019s going, productivity overall?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, productivity is largely unchanged. The issue with folks not showing up for training, that we did see a spike in that the first week that has ameliorated somewhat. So right now, we would typically get, I want to say, 20% of the folks that we would recruit not showing up for training. That\u2019s a fairly normal number. I think we reported that it had spiked to 50%. It\u2019s back down to 30%, so perhaps a bit higher but nothing to be alarmed about any longer. So that\u2019s going well. Fluor is committed to stay on as the construction manager. So, they are still responsible for construction. So, the issue of attracting the craft will go through some bumps in the road with that, but we are pretty confident in Fluor\u2019s ability to staff the project.", "Steve Fleishman", "Okay. And when you say productivity has largely unchanged, is that from when you gave the update two weeks ago or is that from going back to kind of pre-bankruptcy?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, if I take a look at this year, I would say it is largely unchanged for the year.", "Steve Fleishman", "Okay.", "Steve Byrne", "So if we take a look at March\u2019s numbers, we generally get report outs from the contractor that are lagging by month, so sometime in mid-April, I get March\u2019s number. So in reality, I wouldn\u2019t have a good gauge today as to what the productivity numbers are as they have been impacted by the bankruptcy process or not since bankruptcy was what March 29, I think it was.", "Steve Fleishman", "Okay. And then when you gave the update to the Commission and to us before that, you did say that based on the data you had at that time that the cost was within the level of the value to guarantee. Is there any update that you can provide on that?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, I think what we said, Steve, was that the estimate from Westinghouse, their estimate to us of what it would cost to complete above what our current fixed price contract amount is would be within the amount that is the parental guarantee from Toshiba. Now whether we recoup that money through the Westinghouse bankruptcy process or through the Toshiba parental guarantee, we are ambivalent to where it comes from. It\u2019s just that we believe that the increase, I think, we have advertised that as about $1.5 billion and the parental guarantee is a little larger than that. So, we feel that right now that based on the numbers we\u2019ve received from Westinghouse that it\u2019s captured. Now what we are doing in this interim assessment period is our own evaluation as to what the duration is going to be and what those costs are going to be. So, we have to assess the commodity\u2019s unit rates. We have to assess how much labor hours are involved in completing the project. So, we are in the middle of that evaluation now and we will come up with our own schedule and our own cost estimate and then we will see how close we were to the Westinghouse estimate.", "Steve Fleishman", "Okay. And then lastly, just in terms of the site, is everybody basically getting paid through either you or Westinghouse at this point in terms of the contractors?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes. Now, this is the post-petition amount, so from the time we declared bankruptcy on, the agreement that was struck with the bankruptcy and approved by the bankruptcy court was that we would prepay Westinghouse for those amounts and then Westinghouse would make those disbursements to the vendors and subcontractors which they have the contracts with.", "Steve Fleishman", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question will be from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just when you think about the parent guarantee from Toshiba, what is the process if you and Santee Cooper and Toshiba don\u2019t agree on what the amount due under that is? I mean, if you say it\u2019s $2 and Toshiba says it\u2019s $1.50, is there something in the contract that says how that will get resolved whether it\u2019s through a formal arbitration process or some kind of litigation process? We are talking about billions of dollars here, so the potential for one side taking the numbers is different does exist I would believe?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Jimmy. I am sure that, that could be and in fact, it would surprise me if it doesn\u2019t start out that way. But I would say that we have got a pretty good track record of being able to come to reasonable conclusions. And you can just look at how the history of the project over almost a decade now when we have had differences, so not to say that we will at this time, but that would certainly be our approach, but it takes reasonable people on both sides.", "Michael Lapides", "But is there \u2013 in the contract, is there a formal mediation or arbitration process to hammer out the details or you will have to setup a new process and come do an agreement that way?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, Michael, this is Steve. I am not certain because the parental guarantee is actually captured in a separate agreement, because this survives the EPC contract. Certainly, in the EPC contract, we have arbitration and mediation type provisions. I am just not sure as we sit here today if that separate agreement on the parental guarantee contains some kind of a clause. We can look and get back to you on that.", "Michael Lapides", "That would be great. And then just one question, I mean, every quarter you guys \u2013 and these are great filings and we really appreciate it, the quarterly BLRA filings. I noticed the first 4 to 6 months of 2017 had a host of milestones or target milestones in them, lots of them in the April, May timeframe. Can you just talk about your \u2013 where you sit in terms of kind of hitting a lot of those milestones? Steve, you went through a few of them on the call, but just kind of curious whether you think in general the milestones you\u2019ve provided the commission that you would hit in the first 4 to 6 months of the year? Are there any that are still outstanding whether it\u2019s getting reactor coolant pump equipment onsite or the concrete fill of the nuclear island or some of the others related to the containment vessels?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes. Michael, there are lot of puts and takes on the schedule and on the milestones. And as you maybe aware, in the last settlement we had with our Public Service Commission, we had agreed that we are going to stop updating the milestones and there really are only two milestones left that we owe the commission and that is completion of the two units. Now that said, we will look at those BLRA milestones and report to the Office of Regulatory Staff on their completion. Of course, they are onsite daily. So, it\u2019s pretty obvious there. From a milestone perspective, I would say that Westinghouse is still lagging behind where they had hoped to be and that\u2019s one of the things that we are going to take a look at going forward as we transition \u2013 if we decide to continue the project, as we transition to an owner-directed model, we will look at removing some of the impediments that Westinghouse is seeing to completing these milestones and getting them done. They do have a number, you are correct, that are due up this quarter and next quarter. So, if we look at the near future, we should set the second of the two-steam generators for Unit 2 in the second quarter. We should set the third ring section on Unit 2, the containment vessel ring section in the third quarter. And we should also set the pressurizer, which is a large component in the reactor cooling system again late second quarter, early third quarter. The shield building courses, they are going very well. So, most of the milestones you see in the second quarter are going to be Unit 2 milestones. Most of the things that we are doing on Unit 3 involve concrete pours as people don\u2019t have a lot of insight into. And so if I report those out that will be very boring to people. So, those generally are not targeted milestones.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. Thank you, Steve. Much appreciated. Very helpful.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Dan Jenkins", "Hi. I also had a question related to something in your last status report and that was your comment there related to the I-tax submittal rates and you mentioned those needed to increase significantly. And I was wondering if you could update us on the status of that progress?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, we are starting to become more and more comfortable with the I-tax. I think we have got a little under 100 submitted so far. There is 873 per unit, but they are the same, so they are duplicates between unit two and unit three. So the completions, while the rate is not probably up to where we would like to see it, the process is getting smoothed out. So Westinghouse is getting faster and giving the information to us. We are getting a little bit better at turning them around. And then once they get submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it\u2019s a relatively short timeframe before they get them posted in the Federal Register. So that process is going pretty well. We are also working pretty closely with Southern on these, because as you might guess, majority of the I-tax are the same for their units and for our units. It\u2019s just the site-specific stuff that would be different. So the I-tax process in my mind is going better than we had anticipated. That said, there is still by a way of coming that we have tried to prepare the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for and I think they are ready from a staffing perspective to handle those.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Byrd", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure, go ahead Steve.", "Stephen Byrd", "I wanted to just touch on Sanmen in China and just checking with you to see if \u2013 how the status and progress is going at the Sanmen site?", "Steve Byrne", "Yes. Stephen, this is Steve. We don\u2019t have \u2013 I don\u2019t have a latest update on Sanmen. I don\u2019t know that I have got anything beyond what we updated last quarter, which was that they were through their hot functional testing. They had a couple of issues that they had to resolve, which would be normal during a test like that. Once they make the corrections to those issues, some of which are wall trim replacements. They have got some installation that didn\u2019t stand up to high temperatures that they have got to replace. And they have got a heat exchanger issue, I think that we would not have to deal with. But once they get those corrections made, then they will redo that portion of the test and then they would go into fuel load and start up. My understanding is that the first Haiyang unit is also waiting those same corrections. So even though they didn\u2019t get to the point where like the installation melted, they know they have got to change that as well. So they are making the changes on both the Sanmen and the Haiyang unit. So the Haiyang unit won\u2019t finish their hot functional test until after those Sanmen corrections are made. But both \u2013 we anticipate that both units will load fuel this year and start up this year.", "Stephen Byrd", "Okay, thank you. And then just shifting over to \u2013 I guess I am thinking about Federal support for your project, should we be thinking there is some chance or possibility that there could be some degree of Federal support, whether it will be from the Department of Energy or some other agency in terms of wanting to support base load clean power, is that at least a possibility or should we be thinking that\u2019s relatively unlikely?", "Steve Byrne", "Well, I think the most objective thing to say about that is they certainly are \u2013 seem to be supportive of trying to get the production tax credit date extended, which is if you think about it that was what those credits originally put out there for us with new projects like this, they know they are going to be challenges and the credits are put out there to entice some to go out and be the first movers. And so just with these delays, it put us close to those deadlines. So that would be the most tangible objective thing that can be done. And I know the Department of Energy understands that very clearly from personal conversations with them recently. And certainly, South Carolina\u2019s delegation does as in both the House and the Senate bills have been introduced to provide for that and with over 20 co-sponsors only to one. So we are hopeful that, that gets traction.", "Stephen Byrd", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Steve Byrne", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium [ph]. Please go ahead.", "Ashar Khan", "Thank you for your time. I just wanted to check in Jimmy, so right we had this tax agreement that you talked about, I thought that helped us to maintain our ROE at the rate that is as I guess somewhat un-great, so couldn\u2019t we have utilized more of those tax credits in this quarter to offset this weather, I am just trying to get a sense of how that works, do you wait till the end of the year to apply those credits or are you using some assumptions throughout the year or could you just walk me through how that works?", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure. And I think you just about answered your question, which is we really expect to wait over in probably in Q4, so the idea is to use these credits to mitigate each annual BLRA revised rate increase and to use part of it to ensure that the business stays \u2013 the base business stays in a reasonable return of that 9% and 10% in a quarter. As you can see, what we filed there on the \u2013 what we have on the slide there is we estimate it\u2019s a little higher than 9.75%. So it\u2019s still well within that range that we suggest as a reasonable return on the base business and that\u2019s despite some historically mild weather in the first quarter.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. So if you want to make some \u2013 those earnings will show off if you want to do something in all that in the fourth quarter then, right, is that correct?", "Jimmy Addison", "That\u2019s right. And Ashar, it would really \u2013 what we would do is any adjustment we will make would really impact it in the fourth quarter and forward.", "Ashar Khan", "Fourth quarter and forward, okay, fair point. And then Jimmy, can you give us a little bit sense of \u2013 you highlighted to the commission doing completing both plants, completing one plant and of course, the other option was walking away, I am assuming you are continuing the work on both plants right now, I am just trying to make a sense, did you get some feedback from them or no or anything you can share from the commissioners?", "Steve Byrne", "Ashar, this is Steve. The update that we gave was an Ex Parte Briefing, so we didn\u2019t really get a feel other than from the questions. It\u2019s clear that the commission is very interested in this and they want to update as soon as we get some more information, which we have committed that we will go back and get to them. But the \u2013 I think they are well aware of \u2013 they sort of view that provisions on abandonment and they know, because we told them that we are going to be evaluating and completing both units, which obviously will be our preference. But from a prudency perspective, we have to evaluate whether or not mothballing one, abandoning one would be in our best interest. Now, from a load perspective, we still have growth in our service territory and we still have a need for the power. So more unlikely we couldn\u2019t just abandon one and then forget about it, we would have to build something else and more unlikely, that would be gas. So we will be evaluating all those scenarios against a gas going forward scenario.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. And if I can end up with as this review period is going to get extended, you usually file an update report after every quarter, right, so March, I guess you filed one, which will show up and after 45 days, right, in May 15?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. BLRA quarterly report, that\u2019s correct.", "Ashar Khan", "So are we going to see any...?", "Jimmy Addison", "I am sorry our plan is to file that end of next week.", "Ashar Khan", "End of next week. So Jimmy, are we going to see any new numbers or all those reports are still going to report old numbers, because you are going through this review process, which might take another 60 days, so are we going to get any new data in terms of your filing and your BLRA application which goes in, in May for next year, are we going to get any new data or do we have to really wait for the end of the 60-day period, new 60-day period, which would be, by technicality, end of June?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. So we are going to file the report as we should update what we know at the end of March, but we are not going to have any conclusions of this analysis at that point.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. So then really all those reports are basically kind of right, no value, then right, so we have to wait for the conclusion of the analysis to get the real numbers?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that. I think they have a lot of value in that they point out areas of concern and that kind of thing. We are complying with the regulatory orders, but you have to form your own opinion about the value of them.", "Ashar Khan", "Okay. Thank you so much. You are so kind.", "Jimmy Addison", "Certainly.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Paul Patterson", "Good afternoon.", "Jimmy Addison", "Good afternoon Paul.", "Paul Patterson", "A few quick ones, the \u2013 with Vogtle, there was a DIP financing motion filed by Georgia Power and others regarding intellectual property, have you guys made a similar filling and if not, why not?", "Steve Byrne", "We have not made a similar finding and the reason is that we have escrowed intellectual property, so we have access to intellectual property. I think the Vogtle concern was that some of the perhaps filing a lien or that person providing that line of credit or the credit funds for Westinghouse might decide to try to take title to the intellectual property as well as some of the real property. So we don\u2019t have the same issue.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay, great. And then with respect to the 60-day extension on the evaluation, was that \u2013 what caused that, is that because you guys have gotten more of a sense of the \u2013 of what you guys have to do now after the first 30 days or was it kind of always what was contemplated or sort of \u2013 what\u2019s causing, I guess the extension of the evaluation period?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. I will tell you, Paul that we had always looked at a longer period than 30 days to do the evaluation. But going back to when we were putting this in place, a very, very short timeframe leading up to an impending bankruptcy. And we want to get everything prepackaged such that it could be filed easily with the bankruptcy court and that made coordination not just between ourselves and Westinghouse, but also Southern Company. So we got that finished. Going forward however, there is \u2013 we don\u2019t view there to be necessarily a link between a Southern agreement and our agreement so that we can really do our own thing in the next 60-day period. So we had sort of a vision a 60-day to 90-day period all along, but we had to get the thing done initially in order to get the time \u2013 filing timeframe for this bankruptcy proceeding. So that 30 days was the agreed upon amount, so we are doing exactly what we anticipated we would do.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay, that makes sense. And then finally, just the safe harbor, it did \u2013 I did note that there seem to be a mention, which I hadn\u2019t seen before about new joint owners, possible joint owners, with respect to the plants. And is there \u2013 I guess, what was the reason for the cause of putting that in there, is there any potential for new owners?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, I just think as we go through this evaluation, I don\u2019t know how significant a risk is, but there is some risk that the two current partners in the arrangement could end up at different evaluations of the different options that Steve outlined earlier. So again, not putting any \u2013 not suggesting that will happen, but it\u2019s just cautionary.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay, thanks so much. I appreciate it.", "Jimmy Addison", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Neil Kalton", "Hi guys. On the tax credit extensions that you are looking for, any sense as to how fast those bills might progress through Congress. And then also how important are the PTCs for you to really move forward with this project, would you move forward if you didn\u2019t have clarity?", "Jimmy Addison", "Neil, it\u2019s Jimmy. So there is at least three different routes as how they might move through. There is \u2013 in the very near-term, there is going to be in the next week or two weeks, likely a continuing resolution to continue to fund the Federal government. There is some possibility that they are a part of that. If not, there is a possibility that they are part of a more comprehensive tax reform. And then a third channel at least is just the bills get introduced on the floor standalone, so any of those three might happen. And then as far as your question about criticality, I mean there is three large influencers over the viability of these projects. One is the validation of the estimated cost. The second is the recovery of the response of \u2013 financial responsibility from Westinghouse/Toshiba. And then third are these tax credits. And all three of those are in the billions of dollars, so they are all critically important. And we have impressed upon everyone that has a vested interest in South Carolina and in nuclear and in America that listen to us that the timeliness of this is very, very important to this evaluation. So I can\u2019t say absolutely that absent those, part or all of the unit would go forward. But it is very, very, important to the viability.", "Neil Kalton", "Right. Thank you.", "Jimmy Addison", "Certainly.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Stephen D\u2019Ambrisi of Castleton Investment Management. Please go ahead.", "Stephen D\u2019Ambrisi", "Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.", "Jimmy Addison", "Sure.", "Stephen D\u2019Ambrisi", "I just had a follow-up on Ashar\u2019s question, my understanding of the rate background rider was not that it provided incremental earnings, I think you are saying that it could be used to offset weather, but rather that it would be used as a credit to rate base, which would in turn increase your earned ROE, all things considered, so can you just walk through that, would it give you incremental earnings in the fourth quarter or is it just lower your rate base, so your earned ROE looks optically higher?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, it\u2019s the latter. It just affects the lower rate base, so the ROE is higher.", "Stephen D\u2019Ambrisi", "Okay, alright. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks very much guys.", "Jimmy Addison", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, thank you. We remain focused and are working diligently to determine the most prudent path for our nuclear project. Our goal is to reach a decision that addresses the needs of our customers and all of our stakeholders. During this complex transition and evaluation period, we remain committed to providing you with timely information and updates as we move towards a decision. As always, we continue to focus on operating all of our businesses in a safe, reliable and efficient manner. We thank you for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question and answer period [Operator Instructions], As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, August 3rd, 2017. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Iris Griffin, Vice President of Finance.", "Iris Griffin", "Thank you and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the second quarter of 2017. Joining us on the call today are Kevin Marsh, SCANA\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Kevin will provide an overview of the abandonment plan for the new nuclear project, Jimmy, will provide an overview of our financial results, and Steve will discuss line down activities at the new nuclear site. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.", "And finally, before I turn the call over to Kevin, I would like to remind you that certain statements that maybe made during today\u2019s call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the Investors section of our website under Webcast and Presentations.", "I will now turn the call over to Kevin.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks, Iris and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our discussion on Slide 3 with a summary of our decision on the new nuclear project. As you are likely aware, earlier this week we announced our intentions to cease construction and pursue an abandonment plan under the provisions of the Base Load Review Act. This conclusion was reached after an extremely challenging and complex evaluation of the project from multiple perspectives.", "Our analysis led us to a view that while continued construction on both units would be too expensive completing one unit may have been a viable option, should I project ownership structure stays the same. While there were various risks of this scenario and no final determination has been made, Santee Cooper notified us of its intent to suspend construction on the project.", "Santee\u2019s decision made further analysis of this alternative unnecessary, as SCE&G concluded that it would not be in the best interest of its customers and other stakeholders to continue the project on its own.", "As a result, on Tuesday of this week we held an allowable ex-parte briefing and filed the abandon petition with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Slide 4 summarizes the various requests SCE&G made and its filing. Essentially we have asked the commission to affirm SCE&G\u2019s decision to abandon the new nuclear project. A link to the transcript of the ex-parte briefing, as well as the abandonment petition can be found in the investor section of our website.", "Slide 5, presents the timeline for the filing of the abandonment petition, as well as a request for revised rates. As a reminder, the Commission will vote on our petition within six months from the date it is filed. We will continue to work with the office of regulatory staff and any other intervening parties to attempt to reach a fair and balanced resolution to this matter.", "I will now turn the call over to Jimmy, to review our financial results.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Kevin. Up again, our earnings discussion on slide 6. Earnings in the second quarter of 2017 were $0.85 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the same quarter of 2016. And our electric margins were slightly offset by the impact of less extreme weather in the second quarter of 2017, when compared to the same quarter of last year. In the footnote, you will notice that weather increased electric margins about $0.04 per share in the second quarter 2017, compared to $0.05 per share in the second quarter 2016, resulting in a negative $0.01 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter.", "Additionally, increases in gas more margins due to customer growth and rate increases, as well as positive variances O&M and other income will partially offset by CapEx related items, including interest expense, depreciation and property taxes.", "Please turn to Slide 7. Earnings per share for the six months ended June 30 2017 were $2.04 per share versus $1.97 for the same period in 2016. Our electric margins were significantly offset by the impact of milder weather in 2017, compared to the prior year.", "As noted at the bottom of the slide, weather decreased earnings by $0.20 per share for the first six months of 2017,while weather was earnings neutral for the comparable period of 2016. Additionally, increases in gas margins, as well as positive variances in O&M and another income will partially offset increases in interest expense, depreciation and property taxes.", "Now on slide 8, I'd like to briefly review the earnings results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G second quarter 2017 earnings increased versus the same quarter of 2016, due primarily to increasing electric margins, actually offset by the impact of weather, as well as increases in gas margins and lower O&M.", "PSNC earnings were up $0.01 per share for the second quarter of 2017 over the comparable period in 2016, due to higher margins as a result of the late 2016 rate increase and customer growth. SCANA Energy\u2019s earnings for the quarter increased due to higher gas margins.", "I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on slide 9. Through the second quarter of 2017, companies announced plans to invest approximately $480 million with the expectation of creating over 7500 jobs in our North and South Carolina territories.", "At the bottom of this slide, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of June 2017 and 2016. South Carolina's unemployment rate is 4% and it's the lowest to state has been since December of 2000.", "South Carolina continues to see a decrease in unemployment despite continued growth in the labor force. The other states in which we have service territories, North Carolina and Georgia also continue to see declining unemployment rates of 4.2% and 4.8% respectively. This positive business development continues to play a significant role in the strong customer growth numbers for our business.", "On slide 10, we present customer growth and electric sales statistics. The top half of the slide shows the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&Gs Electric business added customers at a year over year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in South and North Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.9% and 2.6% respectively. The strong customer growth continues to be a key fundamental for our businesses.", "The bottom table outlines are actual and weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to retail customers for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017. On the 12 month ended basis weather normal sales are higher by eight tenths of a percent versus the prior period.", "Please look to slide 11, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $11.5 billion. In the box on the right you will SCE&G base electric business in which we are allowed a tentative quarter percent return on equity. The adjusted earned return for the 12 months ended June 30 2017 and the base selection business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher.", "As you recall, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our gas LDC in South Carolina. These rates are set according to the Rate Stabilization Act. The earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside of range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE then we filed to adjust rates.", "As of March 31 2017, the 12 month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band. And we recently filed for an annual increase of approximately $9 million in mid-June. These rates will become effective beginning with the first billing cycle in November.", "As of June 30 2017, the 12 month earned return for PSNC Energy was 10.78%. This temporary situation is mainly due to timing and will move back towards the allowed ROE, as CWRT [ph] placed into service.", "Slide 12 and 13 present our CapEx forecast and financing plans slides respectively. These are both consistent with the slides for Mondays call covering the new nuclear project decision.", "I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance on slide 14. We are reiterating our 2017 GAAP adjusted, weather normalized earnings guidance range of 415 to 435 per share in our internal target of 425 per share. I also wanted to reset O&M expectations for the year, as we now project 2017 O&M expense to be relatively flat. This is primarily due to labor and related savings.", "Our long-term GAAP adjusted, weather normalized annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over three to five years using a base of 2016s GAAP adjusted, weather normalized EPS of 397 per share.", "On slide 15, we present some of the main drivers that are contemplated as part of the growth strategy. PSNC Energy has had a solid growth story for the last few years. We will continue to grow this business using the integrity management rider and periodic rate cases to keep up with the growing demands of our North Carolina territory.", "Additionally, rates stabilization increases may be needed to maintain a reasonable earned return at the SCE&G business as we continue to make investment in that system to meet demand due to customer growth in South Carolina.", "As you are aware, these plans are not new to SCANA, but I've been overshadowed by the focus on the new nuclear projects. As we continue to refine our strategy there could be additional growth at these gas businesses.", "Additionally, we will focus on O&M control, particularly at SCE&G. We will also reap the benefits of lower projecting interest expense, as we issue less debt and accretion from our share buyback program.", "Slide 16, compare some of the aspects of our five year plan before and after our decision to cease construction and pursue abandonment of the new nuclear project and it's consistent with what we presented on Monday's call. As we previously discussed, we planned to focus our strategy on the core electric gas business and on the redeployment of capital.", "I will now turn the call over to Steve to discuss wind down activities at the site.", "Steve Byrne", "Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to slide 17, there are a variety of activities that will be taking place over the next several months to wind down the nuclear construction site as part of our abandonment plan. These activities will be accomplished using a small crew of craft workers and SCE&G oversight.", "First, we will ensure that the site is safe. Which among other things entails laying down cranes, removing scaffolding, de-energizing temporary power supplies and filling in open excavations.", "Next we will stabilize the site by allowing contractors to retrieve their equipment, adding security fencing and gates, removing chemical hazards like welding gases and propane and closing in areas where equipment preservation may enhance investment recovery.", "Facilities that are still needed or were intended to be shared with our operating unit one will be completed. The water treatment plant, service building and security firing range are examples of these. We will need to evaluate relinquishing the NRC combined construction and operating license, as well as other permits.", "We plan to transfer offsite warehouse leases to SCE&G from Westinghouse. Additionally, we intend to complete the transmission associated with the nuclear project as those assets are still needed to meet customer demand.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead that afternoon.", "Travis Miller", "Good afternoon. Thank you. Can you\u2026", "Steve Byrne", "Go ahead, Travis.", "Travis Miller", "Great. The - can appreciate there's been a tiresome busy couple of days for you, so I\u2019ll keep it short here. After the briefing that you had, just wondering what you think of the request would be the biggest challenge to achieve over the coming couple of months?", "Steve Byrne", "Well, I'll start off by saying, we understand and we're not surprised that the commission was shocked at our decision. They expressed that in their opening comments to us and that's really a result of the process by which we are able to inform the commission in rules that were enacted. I think about 10 years ago under new regulations by the state, we're not allowed to communicate with commission solicits in a required hearing or an ex-parte briefing. That is the reason we did ex-parte briefing as quickly as we could after we filed our [indiscernible] about the abandonment.", "So that was the first time that we had heard about it because nobody is allowed to talk to them about the process. Now that's unfortunate. It was not our goal, as far as the commission. These are projects they've taken a lot of pride in and they understood the value, these units would have provided to South Carolina over the long-term.", "So I'm sure it was a shocking and a very disappointing decision for them. We did our best to communicate, the logic behind the decision, I think we did that very clearly and they had a number of questions for us. But the primary focus will be on recovery of the abandonment costs. We've taken a number of key steps to have them understand as we'll continue to do throughout the regulatory process to minimize the impact of that on customers as best we can.", "First process is reduce the impact by the proceeds will get from the Toshiba prime [ph] guarantee, as they come in to help mitigate rates for customers. The benefits of the tax deductions will work in their favor. And as I\u2019ve tried to explain it to the people who have asked me that are non - non-accountants or non-financial people or non-regulatory people as I've been asked around the country, I've tried to explain it this way and round numbers, it's $4.9 billion that we could spend to date, decision to go ahead would have put $5 billion on top of that.", "So since it could be $10 billion, we could have asked the customers to pay for, sure we've gotten that from the commission based on the fixed price commissions we got earlier. The other option was to take off the Toshiba, prime [ph] guarantee, take off the value of the tax deductions and whittle that number down to about $2 billion.", "So from my perspective it was a $2 billion number. We're going to ask the customers to continue paying for or raise it to $10 billion and ask them to pay for that. That was a difficult analysis to go through. And as we said earlier without a partner when Santee decided it was not economical for them to continue with the project, it made our decision pretty much absolute because we certainly couldn't go forward.", "Our goal was to share those thoughts with the commission. We'll do that in more detail. I'm not confident as we file testimony and get into settlement discussions with the various innovators that will likely join the case. So we will continue to send around a recovery of the abandonment cost.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. And you still remain confident that the deal will be upheld after at least these first discussions?", "Steve Byrne", "It's clear that the law provides for it. We're following the procedures outlined in the law, which will for us to make sure we didn't do anything imprudent to put ourselves in this situation. And we've validated everything we have done on the project with the fixed price option it was approved. In 2016 they validated everything. We've been on the project, it was prudent at that point.", "It was shortly thereafter that we learned of the news of the Toshiba financial distress falling out of Westinghouse bankruptcy in March of 2017. So clearly from our perspective we have an active project, its moving forward. We are making progress and looking forward to hitting the targets on Westinghouse.", "We have proved from the project by declaring bankruptcy. That put us in a situation where we had to do the analysis. So we believe we - we were prudent to the point. We learned of the financial distress and bankruptcy of Westinghouse.", "We acted prudently after that, do a thorough evaluation of all options, which included building two plants, building one plant, abandoning one plant or full abandonment. I am confident we made the right decision on behalf of customers and all the other stakeholders. And it will present that in a very clear and understandable form to the commission.", "Travis Miller", "Okay, great. I appreciate the thoughts.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Byrd", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Steve Byrne", "Hi, Stephen.", "Stephen Byrd", "Just wanted to check there was one change to the financial plan from a couple of days ago, it was the equity buyback amount is I think now $1.2 billion, it was $1.0 before what was the driver for the change there?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Stephen. This is Jimmy. It\u2019s just kind of the timeframe. Earlier we were really just taking a little shoulder view of it of the period over the next, I guess, three to four years and here we're got a little further down in our financial plan and I guess getting a little more prescriptive about it.", "Stephen Byrd", "Got you. Understood.", "Jimmy Addison", "And I'm quite confident we'll make adjustments on that as we move through time due to a variety of changes in cash flows and share prices and things like that. But that's just our late assessment.", "Stephen Byrd", "So point taken. And just to build on Travis\u2019s question a little bit, have you all had an opportunity to have a dialogue with some of the legislators who have formed this synergy caucus group just to talk through the situation with those legislators?", "Steve Byrne", "I've not had any personal discussions with any of them since they formed a group. But we believe in open communication. So I'm confident we'll be talking to members of that group. As we go forward we have a very active regulatory team who will certainly be reaching out to members of that group, who can help them understand of the challenges we had and making this decision, and while we decided to stick with the abandonment.", "Our process at the commission is very open and as we said the commission will take a lot of information and as they make their decision, I'm confident we'll be in settlement discussions. We've always been willing to do that. I'm sure a lot of that will be impacted by the various opinions that is out there, just their team and our industrial customers and those that represent the various reservation [ph] groups.", "So they are out there. We understand their concerns. We've not had a chance to estimate the detail filing with the commission, which is where all the facts will be. And that is the published you know regulatory hearing that will take place to the facts.", "There could be others, but we\u2019re confident we can do a good job telling our story. I understand they are disappointed. I mean, we are - I'm sorry we can't deliver the plans, if we had in place to put these two reactors in place.", "And I can understand the disappointment. I can understand their anger because the state \u2013 one of these two reactors at the same time we just didn't feel like it was prudent to proceed with something we believe is too expensive for them in the long run and not cost effective based on what we know today and I\u2019ll be at the presentation to the commission and other groups, I'm sure it will be available to and in front of them throughout the rest of the year.", "Stephen Byrd", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides", "Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I want to - I'm confused. I mean, I think what you've laid out is pretty clear and obviously as you get into the regulatory negotiations things are going to move around the nature of any complex regulatory process.", "I do have one accounting question and it's really a tactical question, when I go back and look at the slide deck from a couple of days ago, on slide 7 you talked about a $1.5 billion tax deduction due to the abandonment of the project.", "And the thing I don't understand is that if you're still going to earn a return on equity, like you're going to have net income that is going to be generated by the project even though it's being abandoned. Why is it being written-off?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes\u2026", "Michael Lapides", "Why is the tax reduction\u2026", "Jimmy Addison", "Very fair question. So the asset itself is not - is not going to be used in the business Michael. So the asset can't be used for its intended purpose initially. So it's less much like inventory, parts or something like that it can't be used for its intended purpose, then you can deduct it for tax purposes. But we're confident in that tax position.", "Now again, we're going to \u2013 and think of the other side of that, that revenue that's coming in from that abandonment is going to be taxable income. So certainly the cost associated with it should be a taxable deduction.", "Michael Lapides", "Right. And I may be totally missing and happy to follow it offline. You're still going to get a pre-tax earnings stream out of the project and the [indiscernible] you'll get less than you otherwise would have because of the deduction, which helps customers, it helps to bill. But it just - I don't know - I'll follow up offline. But you know, that was the one question. The other is\u2026", "Jimmy Addison", "Before you move on, let me point it this way for you. If we didn't deducted then how would you ever deduct it, it would have been deducted through depreciation, had it been put into service. You clearly get a deduction for any incurred cost, so it would never get deducted if you didn't deduct it now.", "Michael Lapides", "Now that makes sense, that makes total sense. And I'll follow offline because I may have some specific tax related questions. Thank you\u2026", "Jimmy Addison", "Sorry to interrupt you. What was your other one?", "Michael Lapides", "No I'm good. I was going to - I'm fine. I'll follow up. Thanks\u2026", "Jimmy Addison", "Okay. Very good.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Kevin Marsh", "All right. Hearing no more questions. I would like to just wrap up for a minute. The last few weeks have been some of the most challenging in our company's history. Our focus for the next few months will remain on our employee transition, core business performance and the execution of the regulatory abandonment proceeding with particular emphasis on near term, great navigation for our customers.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call. [Operator Instructions As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, October 26, 2017. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Iris Griffin, Vice President of Finance.", "Iris Griffin", "Thank you, and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2017. Joining us on the call today are Kevin Marsh, SCANA's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer.", "During the call, Kevin will provide an update on the regulatory and legislative process surrounding our decision to abandon construction of VC Summer Units 2 and 3. Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.", "Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found in the Investors section of our website under Webcasts & Presentations.", "I'll now turn the call over to Kevin.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks, Iris, and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin our discussion on Slide 3 with an update on activities associated with our decision to abandon the new nuclear project.", "As I have said before, the decision to stop work on the project was always our least desired option. However, it was the right decision for our customers based on the impact of the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, their refusal to honour their fixed-price contract as well as the withdrawal of our project partner, Santee Cooper. Top of the slide lays out some of the events that have transpired over the last few months. We have appeared before special committees of both the South Carolina Senate and House of Representatives to explain the details of our project and the evaluation which was the basis of our decision to abandon the project.", "We hope to work with the legislature and other parties to develop a reasonable and comprehensive settlement of the issues relating to the abandonment decision. Our focus is on finding a solution that mitigates the cost impact on customers while positioning the company to continue to be able to serve our customers and meet the state's growing electric demands.", "At the end of September, the Office of Regulatory Staff filed a petition with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina requesting that the commission issue an order directing SCE&G to immediately suspend the collection of revised rates currently being collected under the Base Load Review Act. SCE&G filed a motion with the PSC to dismiss the ORS request, citing numerous legal deficiencies.", "The PSC later chose to defer action on the ORS request in order to establish a briefing and hearing schedule. The PSC took this approach to allow for careful consideration of the arguments given, the potential impact of the proposed actions not just on the company but also to customers in the long run.", "Additionally, the ORS filed a separate motion requesting that the PSC consider the most prudent manner in which SCE&G should pass the value of the Toshiba guarantee payments to customers. We have consistently stated that we intend to use the value of these payments to mitigate cost to our customers. Our goal is to establish this through a comprehensive settlement with the interested parties, which can be presented to the PSC for consideration and approval.", "The bottom of the slide lists the corresponding briefing and hearing schedule associated with the September 26 ORS petition.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jimmy to discuss our financial results.", "Jimmy Addison", "Thanks, Kevin. Before I discuss earnings, I wanted to go over 2 significant financial events that occurred this quarter: the receipt of proceeds from the Toshiba guarantee and the impairment charge associated with the nuclear project.", "Slide 4 presents a breakdown of the cash received both through the monetization on September 27 and the receipt of the initial payment from Toshiba on October 2. The total amount realized is approximately 92% of the Toshiba guarantee, and as previously stated, the value of these payments will be used to mitigate cost to our customers.", "Slide 5 depicts the impairment loss recorded for the quarter as it relates to the new nuclear project. While we believe that the issues regarding recovery of these costs and the rates being collected under the BLRA for financing costs should be resolved in future proceedings before the South Carolina Public Service Commission, the public, political and regulatory response to the abandonment decision has been extremely contentious.", "In light of this and under applicable accounting guidance, SCE&G took a $210 million pre-tax impairment charge or $132 million, net of taxes. The estimate was determined by taking the total cost expended on the new nuclear project that have not been included in revised rates and offsetting those with the approximate net value of the Toshiba settlement proceeds.", "As you are aware, there remains great uncertainty as to the eventual regulatory outcome regarding the abandonment of the project, but it's our current estimate of an impairment charge that is both probable and reasonably estimable under applicable accounting principles.", "The recording of this impairment loss under the accounting rules does not mean that we will not seek full recovery of our prudently incurred costs as there are many possible outcomes to the upcoming regulatory process, and this estimate is subject to change as that process unfolds.", "I'll now begin our earnings discussion on Slide 6. Earnings in the third quarter of 2017 were $0.24 per share compared to a $1.32 per share in the same quarter of 2016. This decrease is primarily related to the impairment loss. As explained in the footnote, abnormal weather increased earnings by $0.08 per share in the third quarter of 2017 compared to abnormal weather contributing $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2016, resulting in a negative $0.19 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter. Gas revenues, offset by higher gas costs, contributed to the earnings for the quarter. Lower O&M expenses and higher other income offset increases in depreciation, property taxes and interest expense.", "Please turn to Slide 7. Earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, were $2.28 per share versus $3.29 per share for the same period in 2016. Again, this decrease is primarily related to the previously mentioned impairment loss associated with the new nuclear project. Higher electric revenues were more than offset by expenses related to fuel for generation, purchased power costs and the impact of abnormal weather compared to the prior year.", "As noted at the bottom of the slide, abnormal weather decreased earnings by $0.12 per share for the first 9 months of 2017, while weather increased earnings by $0.27 per share for the comparable period of 2016 for a year-over-year decrease of $0.39. Additionally, increases in gas revenues, partially offset by gas costs as well as lower O&M expenses and higher other income, boosted earnings for the year. Interest expense, depreciation and property taxes all increased compared to the prior period.", "Now on Slide 8, I'd like to briefly review the earnings results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G's third quarter 2017 earnings decreased versus the same quarter of 2016 due primarily to the impairment loss and the quarter-over-quarter impact of abnormal weather and lower O&M. PSNC's earnings were up $0.04 per share for the third quarter of 2017 over the comparable period in 2016 due to higher gas revenues as a result of a rate increase and customer growth as well as lower O&M. SCANA Energy's earnings for the quarter increased due to lower bad debt expense and lower O&M.", "I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 9. Through the third quarter of 2017, company's announced plans to invest approximately $1 billion, with the expectation of creating over 10,000 jobs in our North and South Carolina territories.", "At the bottom of the slide, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of September 2017 and '16. South Carolina's unemployment rate is 3.9%, the lowest the state has seen since November of 2000 and a full percentage point below a year ago. South Carolina continues to see a decrease in unemployment despite continued growth in the labour force. The other states in which we have service territories, North Carolina and Georgia, also continue to see declining unemployment rates of 4.1% and 4.5%, respectively.", "These positive business developments continue to play a significant role in strong customer growth presented on Slide 10. The top half of the slide shows the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.3%. Our regulated gas businesses in South and North Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively.", "The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. On a 12-month ended basis, weather-normalized sales are 0.8% higher versus the prior period.", "Now please look at Slide 11, which recaps our regulatory returns. SCE&G's base electric business, in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity, earned a return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017, of 8.93%, down 95 basis points due to the negative impact of weather. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our gas LDC in South Carolina. These rates are set according to the Rate Stabilization Act. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending March 31 falls outside of the range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, we file to adjust rates.", "As of March 31, 2017, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band, and we filed for an annual increase. The PSC approved the request for an $8.6 million revenue increase, and the new rates will become effective beginning with the first billing cycle in November.", "As of September 30, 2017, the 12-month earned return for PSNC Energy was 11.61%. This situation is a result of a timing difference on a large capital project scheduled for completion in December of 2017. PSNC does not include [quip in its rate base. However, once this project is completed, it will be added to rate base and the earned ROE should more closely approximate the allowable ROE.", "Slide 12 presents our estimated CapEx forecast. We have removed the base electric business in South Carolina from this forecast as that plan is highly contingent on the outcome and treatment of the new nuclear abandonment decision. However, this forecast highlights our renewed focus on the regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina. As you can see, the total investment in these gas businesses will exceed $1 billion over the next 3 years. Customer growth is the most significant driver for these investments, and continued pipeline integrity investment is also an ongoing focus. Once the NND abandonment process is resolved, we will update the full CapEx and financing plans accordingly.", "I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance on Slide 13. We are reiterating our 2017 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance range of $4.15 to $4.35 per share and our internal target of $4.25 per share. This measure excludes the impact of abnormal weather and the impairment loss.", "At this time, we are unable to provide long-term earnings guidance. While there are fundamental positive factors such as our strong customer growth and the continued expansion of our regulated gas businesses, the key consideration will obviously be the treatment of the abandoned new nuclear project. Once the nuclear abandonment recovery has been addressed, we will provide updated long-term guidance.", "Before I conclude our prepared remarks, I wanted to set the tone for our Q&A session. As we have said in various legislative hearings, we believe our actions related to the nuclear project have been prudent and were in the best interest of our customers. While it is always our intention to be as transparent as possible, please understand we are not in a position to discuss the possible time lines and outcomes of any pending litigation or investigation surrounding the new nuclear project.", "We'll now be glad to respond to your questions on other matters.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "So perhaps just -- I know it's a little bit tricky for you guys to talk, but perhaps, could you elaborate a little bit on thinking of recovery of sort of related capital expenditures, for instance, the $300 million to $400 million on the associated transmission and how you think about that in the context of your lag as -- into '18 as well as potential replacement capacity today and what the time line, at least to address that conversation, might be despite everything else going on?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Julien, it's Jimmy. I'll start on that. So, the transmission is, roughly, 75% of it is in service today, completed construction, and the other is progressing. So, it's already strengthened the system and is used and useful today. So, we don't really see a concern in that. And it's -- really, what our proposal was in our original petition, and we'll take this back up at some point, is for that to be considered down the road as part of the base electric business. So, we'll -- we would propose to incorporate that into the kind of the returns of the base business and that be considered in a base rate case down the road. As far as current capacity, et cetera, we're buying on the open market today. It's fairly available out there. We're buying 300 megawatts today. So, we'll re-evaluate that once we get this situation cleared up with the new nuclear here.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Got it. And so basically, there could be a potential replacement, all that gas capacity or extensions just in terms of open market purchase -- continuing the open market purchases for the time being?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, no commitment either way at this point. The current purchase runs through the end of '19, so we've got some room to evaluate that.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "Excellent. And then turning to the gas utilities side of the business. Obviously, with a reduced CapEx budget today, how are you thinking about a potential to accelerate spend on the PSNC at the South Carolina gas utility piece today? And when would you expect to update or discuss your capital budgets on that side? Again, trying to be respectful of ignoring the other questions at large here.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. So, on the 2 gas LDCs, we'll update that CapEx quarterly as we have project changes, et cetera. And I would say I wouldn't characterize it as accelerating spend necessarily as it is responding to the customers' needs and demands. So as the lower natural gas price is projected for quite a period of time, there's been a lot of demand for it from industrial customers for electric generation and from other IOUs, et cetera. So, it's really responding to that [indiscernible] CapEx every quarter as we re-evaluate the projects over the next kind of 36-month view. That's typically what we disclose.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Kevin, can I just ask, too? I don't know if you can respond to that. Has the board responded to the letter that was sent by the governor or not?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, we had a board meeting this week, and certainly, the board is aware of the letter that came out from the governor. Those are issues that had previously been raised by the Office of Regulatory Staff and their filings or other filings before the commission, so it was not really a new issue. So, it didn't surprise me that the governor sent the letter. Those are topics that have gotten a lot of attention from a variety of parties. It certainly doesn't have any weight in terms of authority from a law perspective, but we don't want to ignore his opinion. Those are facts. It will be evaluated in the hearings as we address the issues that have already been filed at the commission by the Office of Regulatory Staff.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then I know -- just trying to get a little bit because we are in kind of a no man's land. Kevin, from your perspective, when is -- do you think, knowing what you know now, is that we get some kind of settlement or resolve of this case one way or the other as we look into the future? Could you kind of walk us through what this petition, the timing? And when does it get addressed in terms of some kind of a clarity to your shareholders? Could you just walk us through some time lines or something?", "Kevin Marsh", "Sure, and that's a fair question. There are a couple of things, I believe, could have an impact on that. Back up just a little bit and remind you, when we filed our petition with the commission in early August for our abandonment decision or the treatment under the abandonment clause under the Base Load Review Act, that would have triggered a 6-month period based on a normal hearing schedule at the commission. ", "When we were asked by the leaders of the House and the Senate to withdraw that to give them a chance to go to their review process, we did that, which I still believe it was a good idea to give everybody a chance to understand all the facts and circumstances around the decision that we made. That kind of put that process on hold, so once we refile with the commission, that would again start the 6-month process. And we have told the House and the Senate and other leaders around the state that at some point, we will need to go back and file with the commission because that is the avenue for a file decision. ", "When we were in front of both of the House and the Senate committees, giving explanations and details behind the decision to make -- to do the abandonment, we talked about our goal and desire to find the right parties to bring together that would include both of their representatives, trying to find a comprehensive settlement. It would be in everybody's best interest and mitigate cost to customers going forward. And we envision that, that would be done through a settlement process that typically took place as part of the regulatory process. This is a very different situation, given the attention that's been given to it. ", "So, I believe at this point is we will find a settlement process outside of the commission filing probably before we actually make the filing with the commission. We have had some preliminary conceptual discussions with some of the parties. Out of respect for the process or the parties, I don't want to get into the details at this point because we don't have anything definitive, but we will certainly make a disclosure when there's something substantive to discuss. All that being said, the House and the Senate, I believe, are close to concluding their review process. ", "Their goal is to, as they've indicated to us, is determine what changes, if any, they want to make to the regulatory structure or the Base Load Review Act on a go-forward basis. Their desire to have that prepared to go when the session comes back in, in early [indiscernible]. So, it would be my hope we've got a settlement position in place that hopefully we've all agreed to that we can file with the commission prior to the session coming back into play in early January or shortly thereafter. But that's dependent, I think, upon the duration of the settlement discussions and different opportunities might have as part of that process. ", "We would like to do that before the end of the year, but we want to be respectful of the process and give this settlement option an opportunity to work itself through, which I think will be helpful to the overall regulatory process when we do file. So, I know that's not a definitive answer, but we're not talking a year. I think we're talking within the next 6 months that we would file and hopefully get a decision from the commission within that 6-month time frame.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Frank with Corso Capital Management.", "David Frank", "A question. Just assuming that you fail to reach a settlement hypothetically here. If the legislature took action against South Carolina Gas and Electric to disallow recovery of some or all of its investment in VC Summer, would that same law also apply to the recovery for Santee Cooper? And if not, why?", "Kevin Marsh", "Now let me see if I can sort through the couple of questions you've got there. The work that's being done by the legislature is not part of the official regulatory process. Certainly, their opinions would carry a lot of weight, but my understanding is they cannot reach a decision on their own as to make something happen. It would ultimately have to go back through the commission. So, they may have recommendations for the commission, they may have recommendations relative to the Base Load Review Act itself. But they would not be the ones that would make the decision as part of the regulatory filing we would make at the commission for the abandonment treatment. If there were a settlement, I think that settlement would go to the commission. ", "If there were not a settlement and for some unfortunate reason, we were not able to reach a settlement, then the company would have the ability to file, as it did back in August, and go through the traditional regulatory process, of which I'm sure the legislative bodies would likely intervene and give their opinions as part of that process. But they can't make the decision on their own from a regulatory perspective without going through the commission under the current law. Santee Cooper is not -- Santee Cooper is not subject to regulation by the Public Service Commission. So, their board is the authority now that makes decisions relative to their rates and what rates they would charge their customers to recover their bond financing cost.", "David Frank", "Right. No, I understand that. But my point is that if the legislature tried to pass a new law, which somehow undid the BLRA or part of it, I think this is what every investor or one of the two main things investors are most afraid of, is that the legislature comes in and tries to rewrite a law. And I'm just wondering, would they shoot the state in the foot if they try to draft a law that targeted just South Carolina Gas and Electric? Would a law, in order to be fair, would it also have to apply to Santee Cooper's investments since they were a partner with you in the nuclear plant? From the perspective of they wouldn't want to cost themselves, the state billions of dollars if they tried to somehow undermine your recovery, there would have to be a level playing field that a law would also have to apply to your partner. I realize you're not regulated by the commission.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, well, Santee Cooper does not fall under the Base Load Review Act. So, if they took an effort to retroactively change the law or cancel a law altogether, that would not have a direct impact on Santee Cooper. I know that there's anything that precludes them from taking action directly against Santee Cooper since they do have -- since the governor does have control over the board and the members of the board and the decisions, I guess, they would ultimately make, that would-be part of that legal legislative process. But they don't fall -- Santee Cooper does not fall under the Base Load Review Act. I don't think they could reach out and try to apply that to them since it was designed to apply to the regulated utilities at the commission.", "David Frank", "Okay. And just on the $1.5 billion that you have yet to recover under the abandonment. If you don't reach a settlement, I assume you would look to file for recovery prior to the legislative session coming back in place. And my real question here is, by filing, does that somehow preserve any legal rights to recovery, give you a placeholder should there be some tampering or attempt to tamper with the law later rather than wait until after they try to change the law and then file?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, we are certainly evaluating all of those options. And I'm comfortable saying that we're going to do everything we can to reach a settlement because I believe that's the best solution for all the parties involved. But absent a settlement, we do believe we would need to file to protect our customers and our investors. And we would do what we thought was in the best interest of those parties.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar.", "Travis Miller", "A bit of an accounting question here. On AFUDC, and I'm thinking about in terms of the guidance, what that AFUDC was projected back when you set that guidance, what it's developed into as you've added the $1-or-so billion of capital throughout the year, and then how that fits into the guidance range today, and then kind of what happens when you're not investing any capital in the third, fourth quarter on the nuclear project. Just wondering if you could walk me through kind of how that AFUDC built on the equity and the net interest would work.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Travis, this is Jimmy. So, the -- you're definitely right. We do expect it to be lower. I'm not going to get into individual projections on line items other than to say we get that all in the comprehensive evaluation of our guidance affirmation that we made earlier. But I will say that you're right, that, certainly, with lower spend, there's less AFUDC to be computed. And frankly, the rate has been lower this year as well because the way it works, we've had a lot of short-term debt outstanding during the first 9 months of the year. So that rate has been lower, too. So, it's been lower for both of those reasons. And then third, once we elect to abandon, we've really converted -- you no longer can really compute AFUDC kind of proper on it. We've computed a carrying cost, if you will, as a proxy that's based on the weighted average cost of our debt. So, we've made, really, those 3 factors that are impacting it, but we have considered all of that in our guidance update.", "Travis Miller", "Okay. Great. And then with the impairment, how does that then affect AFUDC? If I understand correctly, because you've been carrying some of that kind of $1-ish billion throughout the year, is AFUDC included in the impairment that you've recorded so far in the first and second quarter? Does that make sense?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, the impairment is the $210 million, Travis. If I understand your question, is there some AFUDC included in that $210 million? I believe so, but frankly, I'm not completely sure. But I believe there would be a proportional amount in there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.", "Shahriar Pourreza", "I guess, you didn't want to talk about timing, and, I guess, you got pushed into talking about timing. I just need to just confirm just something. So, you're shooting for hopefully to file something within 6 months beginning of the year, and you're looking at a settlement with lawmakers by year-end. Is that about, right?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, that would be certainly our goal, is to reach a settlement as soon as we could. I think a logical progression, assuming we make that settlement, would be we would file that along with the petition as soon after that as practical.", "Shahriar Pourreza", "Okay. So -- okay. And then 2018 outlook likely will be pending until we get past those proceedings?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, I think we need to understand what the settlement would be, and that will put us in a position with the data we need to do the longer-term projection based on that settlement.", "Shahriar Pourreza", "Okay, got it. And then just lastly, appreciate the sensitivity with the conversations with lawmakers. But is there any sort of any kind of visibility you can give us as far as what some of the pushes and takes are or at least how the conversations are going and how they're progressing at more of a top level?", "Kevin Marsh", "I really can't talk about the individual components of the conversation. There are a variety of issues on the table. Certainly, customers and legislators and our team have different views on many issues regarding recovery. We're looking for the solution that will try to balance those as best possible and maintain the financial health of our company so that we can continue to serve the customers that depend on us every day. We're at the very early stages. I just don't have anything definitive to report. I look at it as a positive that we're having discussions, and that process is hopefully going to continue to increase.", "Shahriar Pourreza", "Got it. And it's fair to say that the settlement discussions pretty much relate to abandoning of the nuclear plant, right? There's no path to continue?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, that -- we believe abandonment is the right decision in the best interest of our customers. We don't have any other potential partners that have stepped up and been willing to join the discussion. We did the comprehensive evaluation that shows, from a customer perspective, that while disappointing, abandonment is the best option. And once we chose that option, we look to figure to determine how we could lower the impact on customers. And that's why with the money coming in from Toshiba settlement, the benefit of the tax deduction, we believe abandonment is in their best interest. We don't know of any one that's expressed an interest to complete those plants anytime in the near future. I don't know what discussions the governor has had with the different people. But my understanding from my sources is that no one has expressed an interest in completing those plants today.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chris Ellinghaus with Williams Capital.", "Christopher Ellinghaus", "A couple of things about sort of the abandonment process itself. Have you made any sales or have any serious prospects for monetizing any equipment at this point?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Chris, we are looking at that, of course, in concert with our partner in that. But I don't believe that based upon what we know today, that any of that would-be material in relation to the cost incurred.", "Christopher Ellinghaus", "Okay. And has -- are you spending any money today to sort of button up the site? Or do you have any expectations that there'll be future expenditures required to sort of mothball the site, sort of akin to the way Santee Cooper has spoken about it in hearings?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, we're going through an evaluation now to determine what's necessary, and we have been taking steps to put the site in a safe condition, removing all of the cranes and the construction equipment that was on site to facilitate the work that was being done. We have materials and parts that are stored in warehouses. We're certainly doing inventories of those and sharing the listing of those with people that might have an interest in possibly purchasing those down the road. ", "From a mothball perspective, under the abandonment provisions, under the Internal Revenue Code, if we intend to mothball the plant to potentially start it back up at a future date, that could put our decision to take the abandonment deduction in jeopardy. ", "So, we're studying that very carefully now, knowing what you could preserve for potential future sale versus what you would truly abandon so you would qualify for the tax deduction. We don't have to make those decisions today, but we will need to make those by the end of the year. And we continue that evaluation with Santee Cooper to understand where that line would be drawn and what opportunities we would have. But our priority is to make sure we can preserve the ability to take the abandonment deduction because that's worth $2 billion to our customers, which is 3x the value of the Toshiba money that came in on an after-tax basis. So, it's a significant benefit for the customers, and we believe that's critical as part of our settlement discussions and trying to minimize the impact to our customers over the long term.", "Christopher Ellinghaus", "Okay, great. Can you talk about what you're spending today for legal and regulatory costs? Is it material?", "Jimmy Addison", "We've certainly ramped up compared to what we've normally incurred, that's for sure, Chris. But I would not say that it is material in relation to our financial statements in that context. It's a significant sum of money, that's for sure. But I [don't think it's material to our financials at this point.", "Christopher Ellinghaus", "Okay. And one last question. Kevin, you were sort of talking about you've had some modest talks with the legislature so far about settlement. Are they -- can you tell us, are they thinking similarly to you? Or is your thought process about trying to have a settlement by the end of the year sort of your hope? Or are they thinking along the same lines?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, I believe what I said earlier is we were having some discussions with some of the parties that would be involved in the settlement. I don't believe I called out the legislature directly. There are people with different views on the timing and what their views would be on settlement. What I meant to indicate was based on what the House and the Senate committees have shared with us is they do plan to conclude their processes before the end of the year. And I'm hopeful that concluding their processes will give us an opportunity to conclude some successful settlement negotiations, at which we'll drive our filing with the commission. That's why I got to my year-end time frame.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Jenkins with The State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins", "So first, I had a couple of questions. The Toshiba guarantee, you've already recovered, it looks like, $1.1 billion. So, I assume that's already on your balance sheet. And is there a -- like how are you viewing that cash in terms of uses? Is that just going to sit their kind of as a rainy-day fund until you get more clarity? Or, I guess, how should we think about that cash that you currently have?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Dan, 2 different parts of that. So, the cash in the short term, we have used to pay down the commercial paper that was incurred to support the construction payments over this -- the last several months. So that's the cash side of it. So, we have essentially paid down most of that commercial paper that's matured over the last 30 days. And there will be some residual there that will be in cash, a minority of the amount. The separate tract to that is how is that ultimately used for the benefit of our customers, which we said from day 1 it would be. So that will be wrapped up, we hope, in this comprehensive settlement that Kevin's talked about earlier. That would be the regulatory treatment of it.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And similarly, you mentioned that the potential tax benefit from the abandonment is worth $2 billion. Is there anything additionally you need to do to kind of solidify that deduction for the current year tax return or whenever that would become eligible as a tax write-off?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. Our current intention is to take that deduction this year, which has some benefits and to reaching back a couple of years for taxes that were paid in earlier years. So, we think that to get that cash as soon as we can for the benefit of customers is the most advantageous route. So as Kevin elaborated earlier, we're doing everything we understand -- we can understand to make sure that we qualify for that this year because of the value of it. And so that's an ongoing process. Certainly, a lot of things had to be done with the stoppage of the construction to make the site safe, to stabilize different equipment -- let vendors remove equipment, et cetera, and secure the site. But we'll -- our intention is to wrap that up before year-end to solidify that deduction.", "Dan Jenkins", "So how should we think about just how that's going to flow through the cash flow statement in terms of -- how much would that $2 billion would be seen in this current year? And then how much would be left over for future tax credits and so forth? How long would that probably extend? Do you have a feeling for that?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes. So, some of the $2 billion, as you'll remember from -- maybe from our application filing, about 25% of it, we had already claimed through the various R&E tax credits. The other 75% or $1.5 billion is what we're talking about here. And there might be a couple hundred million dollars that we can -- $200 million to $250 million that we can reach back into an earlier year if we claim the deduction this year. And then the balance of, let's say, $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, we would have to use prospectively over -- we project it would take us probably 4 to 5 years to use that through NOL.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then I just want to make sure I'm understanding kind of the legal arguments being made. I'm not an attorney. I recognize you guys are neither, but I imagine you've had quite a few meetings and conversations with attorneys. So, I just want to verify my understanding's correct. So, the ORS, when they filed a petition to suspend the rate collections, that was primarily based on the AG opinion, right, that the Base Load Review Act law was potentially unconstitutional? Is that -- am I reading that correctly?", "Kevin Marsh", "Part of the filing, but the ORS did refer to the opinion that came from the Attorney General where he said that portions of the Base Load Review Act may be suspect as to their constitutionality, but that really doesn't have any weight in the law because it's never gotten -- never going through or contested by a court of the state. The opinion, while it is an opinion, has no weight at this point, in our opinion, which is why we challenge the filing with the Office of Regulatory Staff at the commission.", "Dan Jenkins", "Right. And that opinion, at least I looked at it over somewhat, it sounds like the basis of that opinion primarily rests on kind of the concept of the plants not used and useful. Was that your reading of that or what you've heard from your attorneys? Was that...", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, I can't -- Dan, I can't make a legal judgment on the basis they determine their opinion. I just know we believe that the law that's on the books today is constitutional. We believe it's been in place for 9, 10 years. It's been at the commission, have been followed by the commission. It's been in the Supreme Court a couple of times, and nobody has challenged the constitutionality of the law to this point. And there's just a strong presumption that a law is constitutional when it's passed by the General Assembly. That's generally the case, and we would stand by that and intend to defend that if necessary.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And beyond just -- like there's been -- there's quite a bit of case law that has allowed recovery for like cost, the plants that were abandoned because they became uneconomic and so forth, that would kind of go against the argument being made on the Houston usefulness. Is that your understanding as well?", "Kevin Marsh", "Again, I just can't get into the legal opinions. We believe what we have done and invested under law was appropriate and under the law to the extent we reach a settlement or otherwise would be recoverable under the terms and conditions of the law.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then speaking of the settlement that you're hopeful to reach, there's still probably a number of parties though that probably -- it sounds like at least their current positions are something you wouldn't be able to agree to, particularly thinking of some of the environmental groups and so forth. So, unless everybody agreed to the settlement, it's still likely to be -- or it's still potentially to be litigated through the courts. Is that your -- what we should expect? Or how should we think about that?", "Kevin Marsh", "Well, I can't speak for them, but I know we have had numerous settlements that have gone before the commission. To my knowledge, the environmental groups have not signed on to any of those. And I'm drawing on my memory so I could be incorrect here, but some of those, they have appealed, and some of those, they have not appealed when they've been approved by the commission. I don't believe it's gone all one way or the other.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides", "Simple question. How do reserve margins now look in South Carolina state as a whole and then your service territory over the next 3 to 5 years?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Michael, I don't have anything on reserve margins at my fingertips now, but I'd go back to my comments earlier about capacity. We found a market where we could buy capacity when the plants were delayed. And we're in that cycle now where we purchase that capacity through the end of '19. So generally, there's energy to be had in the southeast. So, I just can't comment any more specifically about it right now in the near term.", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, I can add a little bit to that, Michael. With the purchase we've got, we're within the guidelines that have been established by the commissioner. We typically follow with the commission for an adequate reserve margin. We've heard Lonnie Carter from Santee Cooper, their former CEO, indicate that they didn't need any generation for quite a few years. So, I know they've got plenty of capacity. So, our belief is there is available capacity in the marketplace for us to access should the need be there for us to maintain our reserve margins.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it. And where are you in terms of thinking about incremental renewable developments in South Carolina?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, we have been doing renewable development for a number of years under Act 236. It was passed by the commission 3, 4 years ago. We had guidelines set forth in that. We're well on our way to meeting those guidelines. There are certainly a lot of companies or investors that have looked to bring solar onto the system, under the [purple requirements. We have quite a few megawatts in the queue that we will continue to evaluate. We've got about 50 megawatts on the system now. That could easily double here in the near future based on the interest we've seen. And again, I'd remind everyone, we are not opposed to renewables. We think they have a good solid place on the system. We just got to make sure we do it in a way that we can meet our peak needs when that energy is available, we're a winter peaking company, and that typically happens in the early morning hours before the sun has risen to the point that all of those solar farms would generate what we need. So, we got to be cautious on how we do that. But certainly, we're ramping up our efforts to bring solar onto the system. We just finished a solar farm close to 2 megawatts right outside of our campus here in the last 30 days, and it will be online soon.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "Steven Fleishman", "Maybe if you read the papers and listen to the hearings, it doesn't sound like you have a lot of friends down there right now. So, I'm just curious in terms of any settlement talks you've had so far. Is the tone of those different than what we hear in the papers and listen to in the hearings [indiscernible] so far?", "Kevin Marsh", "Yes, we have had very preliminary discussions. The tone has been open, looking for ideas. We're talking about conceptual ways we might be able to find a solution, but we don't have anything definitive yet. But I'm optimistic the fact that people are talking to us, that we'll have some legitimate effort to find a solution.", "Jimmy Addison", "Steve, this is Jimmy. I'd just offer one word. I would just say that the characterization would be professional, very, very professional discussions.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. And is there a breadth of parties involved here in terms of just the people that you would normally have to have an agreement with?", "Kevin Marsh", "I don't want to get into the particular parties at this point, but I would also tell you though, we typically have a wide variety to include the Office of Regulatory Staff. I think in this case, for us to be successful, we're going to have to have input from the legislature. And we also typically have input from our large industrial customers, small business, Chamber of Commerce, other large customers that may have an interest in the settlement. I don't see that any different. But the real difference I see at this point would be having a legislature involved. The Electric Cooperatives of South Carolina certainly, I think, have a vested interest over the long term, and I think we're likely to see them at the table as we go through these discussions. So, it'd be a little broader group than we typically have, but most of the players, we know well and we have good relationships with them. And as Jimmy said, we'll have a professional discussion.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. And then just one numbers question. What is your total collection so far under the BLRA? Do you have like a cumulative number?", "Jimmy Addison", "It's about $1.7 billion.", "Steven Fleishman", "Okay. And then one other -- just a quick one. Just -- is your 10 -- when's your 10-Q going to be filed?", "Jimmy Addison", "It's got to be filed by, I believe, the deadline is like November 9, and we'll file it inside of that deadline.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Fremont with Mizuho.", "Paul Fremont", "I guess, Southern Company basically has indicated that they're going to recommend using the Toshiba proceeds to reduce the regulatory asset. And, I guess, their claim is that in the long run, ratepayers are going to be better off because, ultimately, if you just used the money that -- to pay out the refunds on a near-term basis, customers are going to end up spending a lot more sort of over the duration. Any thoughts on that? And also from a shareholder perspective, would not using the Toshiba proceeds reduce the regulatory asset? Wouldn't that essentially de-risk some of the investments that you've made in the plant?", "Jimmy Addison", "Paul, this is Jimmy. I would just say that, certainly, the settlement funds there are central to these discussions that we're having. I'm not going to get into characterizing individual parts and kind of the process and all that Kevin said initially. But it's an important part. But I would reemphasize something else, which is this tax deduction is 3x the amount of this Toshiba settlement. So -- and it's cash, just from a different source. And so, both of those are on the table and key to these discussions.", "Paul Fremont", "Okay. And then if I look at the -- at your Slide 3, the -- and the schedule, if oral arguments are scheduled right now on December 12, would it be fair to say that within 2 to 3 months after that would be sort of the expected time line for a final order in that proceeding?", "Jimmy Addison", "No. So, Paul, this is just the schedule around ORS's motions and our motions around their filing to stop collecting the rates, et cetera. What Kevin described earlier is if we get a settlement process working, we'll need to, in accordance with the statute here in South Carolina, we'll need to file the abandonment proceeding again that we withdrew mid-August. And that was...", "Paul Fremont", "Right. No, I'm just saying, on this motion, when would sort of the expected time frame be for a final order on their motion?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, I don't know that, that's specifically outlined. So, I think that's probably up to the commission's discretion, but I don't know the specific answer to that.", "Paul Fremont", "Okay. And then -- and you were talking just now about sort of a separate abandonment filing. So, assuming -- I would assume that if you were to reach a settlement, it would be in the context of that filing that hasn't even yet occurred, right? But that would be the proceeding in which it would most likely be applicable?", "Jimmy Addison", "That would be correct. And we would file that settlement and the support of it in that proceeding.", "Paul Fremont", "And then if you're unable to reach a settlement, is there sort of an expected time frame by which you would likely file the abandonment case?", "Kevin Marsh", "We haven't given -- this is Kevin. We haven't given a particular time frame. We want to make sure we've exhausted all opportunities for a settlement before we consider that track.", "Paul Fremont", "Okay. And then my last question is, I think the legislature or members, certain individuals in the legislature have asked to become intervenors in some of the cases, I guess, the -- maybe the ORS motion to dismiss as well as your original abandonment case. Is there a potential conflict in them acting as an intervenor in the case, given the fact that they select the commissioners?", "Kevin Marsh", "I don't know the answer to that question, but I can confirm they have intervened. I don't know that, that's a negative at this point because that gives us an opportunity to negotiate with them as intervenors in any potential hearing, which is, to me, a plus for the opportunity for a settlement process to occur.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson", "Well, you'll be happy to know that most of my questions have been answered, but just sort of to follow up on the legislature and sort of the settlement process. It appears that the central issue sort of abandonment and sort of the tax benefit, which is clearly a big mitigation element, is not fully understood by the commissioner, perhaps other party -- excuse me, so the legislatures and perhaps some of the other parties. Insofar from what I've heard, insofar as if they don't want you to build it, they want you to mothball it. A number of them do, and even the ORS seems to be suggesting that, that seems to be part of it. I'm just wondering, I mean, in terms of your discussions with these guys, and I know -- I don't want you to get too far ahead of yourselves on it, but just in general, how should we think about this? Because it seems that there is a big disparity when we think in terms of how people are thinking about sort of these fundamental issues in terms of resolving and mitigating the issue for ratepayers. Do you follow me?", "Jimmy Addison", "I do, Paul, and I understand where you're coming from that, especially if you're kind of watching from afar and seeing some of this. I will say that some of the legislative committee members have understood this from day 1, and I think it's becoming clear to most. And I think the local press here has even picked up on this issue today and have publicized it some more. So, I think folks are starting to understand. And the choice is really pretty simple. It's $4.2 billion that we have to recover or take -- get the tax deduction solidified, and it's $2 billion ultimately. So, it's a huge difference. Obviously, almost 50%, and both of those are after the net of tax impact of the Toshiba settlement. So, it is a huge issue. It's almost half of the difference. So, I think everyone is catching on to this.", "Paul Patterson", "Okay. And then I can -- I have to think that this is somewhat of an expensive process, given all the sort of investigations and litigation and everything else. How should we think about -- I mean, how material, if you can give us sort of a sense, just the cost of all this is and how that might, in fact, impact EPS and how we should think about that going forward.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, all I'll say about earnings is we have contemplated that in our updated guidance that we gave earlier this afternoon. So, it's in that commitment to the $4.15 to the $4.35 based upon what we know today, we've made an estimate of and have it contemplated. But it is expensive. But it's not, I would say, material to the financial statement. It's very expensive in time, too. And it is absorbing a lot of time of a lot of us. That's why it's important that we get to some conclusions on these settlements as well.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo.", "Kamal Patel", "I have 2 questions, one regarding the impairment charge. So, the $1.22 billion is what was basically subject to review. Are you just making the assumption that, that is no longer recoverable? And if so, given the past state court proceedings in support of the BLRA, why would you be inclined to make that decision?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, Kamal, it's Jimmy. So, what we're doing there is, under the accounting principles, we've got to mix our best estimate of what's probable and reasonably estimable. And that's what we've done under these accounting principles. And recording of the loss under the rules doesn't mean that we'll not seek full recovery of our prudently incurred costs. That's not what we're suggesting here at all. There's many possible outcomes to the proceeding and to our -- even to our settlement discussions to this point. We're just trying to, as best we can, apply these accounting rules to the situation at this point. So, we're not giving up on asking for those costs at all.", "Kamal Patel", "So, this isn't -- this in no way is a -- I guess, viewed being taken on past legal decisions?", "Jimmy Addison", "No, it is not. It is simply an application of the -- of our application and a highly judgmental situation of the accounting rules. It's not a legal position at all.", "Kamal Patel", "Okay. And then just looking at capital structure. Would this revision slow down and, I guess, your dividend growth on one topic? And then would there be explicit support given to ratings through equity infusion at the utility level or something like that, if needed?", "Jimmy Addison", "Let me make sure I understand your first question. Was it -- first part of this question. Was it tied back to this impairment?", "Kamal Patel", "Generally speaking, the slower earnings growth trajectory that you could realize from the project not being in -- proceed any longer.", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, well, as we said earlier, I'm really not going to be able to answer that because we're not commenting on long-term guidance at this point. But we have -- we've not commented on anything on guidance. We've not said it will be slower. We've not said it will be the same. We've not said it will be faster. So, we've got to get through this process, get a new base, if you will, for what we're going to base our earnings growth off of. And then we'll comment on guidance long term.", "Kamal Patel", "Okay. And then from a ratings perspective?", "Jimmy Addison", "Yes, repeat your question there for me? I'm sorry.", "Kamal Patel", "From a ratings perspective, will there -- would -- if there was additional equity needed by the utility, will there be an infusion of equity or would you let the ratings weaken?", "Jimmy Addison", "Well, I think the ratings today don't necessarily reflect the metrics because of all the uncertainty around the whole resolution to this matter. So, I think we've got to get through the -- I know we have to get through the resolution of this matter so that the agencies can better project what the future's going to look like with some certainty. Because the metrics we have today are different than the ratings most of them have been adjusted here in the short term. So, I don't really want to get into the speculation of what we might do with different outcomes. But I think we just -- it's kind of the same answer as the other one. We've got to get to the resolution of this uncertainty, understand where we are, then we can update long-term guidance and look at the whole cap structure and see where we need to go. Our desire would be if we're in a fiscal position to do it after this legislative regulatory outcome to have an investment-grade-rated opco and holdco, assuming we've got the financial wherewithal to do that.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Marsh for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Marsh", "Thanks for taking time to join us today and certainly for asking your questions. I want to say our top priority remains finding this comprehensive settlement that will lead to a fair regulatory decision on the abandonment of the new nuclear project. However, as we work through that process, we will continue to focus on operating our businesses in a safe and reliable manner.
