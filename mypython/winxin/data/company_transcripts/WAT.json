All participants will be able to listen-only until the conference has a question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, well good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter 2015 conference call. With me on today's call is Gene Cassis, the Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "As is our normal custom I will start with an overview of the business then Gene will follow with details of our financial results and an outlook for our business in the second quarter and for the full year 2015. But before we start, I\u2019d like Gene to cover the cautionary language.", "Gene Cassis", "Thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for the second quarter 2015 and for full year 2015. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, please see our Form 10-K Annual Report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding our possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for July 2015.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials and that was included in this morning's press release also. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thanks, Gene. Well, we had a strong and a very encouraging start to 2015. The strong business momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014 continued through the current quarter with strength in our pharmaceutical life science end markets and improving sales growth in China. The 15% organic growth rate that we saw in the quarter was geographically broad based and also very balanced across our major product lines, with instrument system sales and recurring revenue both at mid-teens growth rates.", "Looking at our operating divisions, Waters' division constant currency sales grew 15%. The strength that we saw in quarter for this division partially included the benefits to a favorable basic comparison and additional selling days in the quarter. Similarly our TA Instruments Division enjoyed a strong start to the year and delivered 14% growth. Currency translation reduced our overall cost in currency sales growth by 8% in the quarter as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening against all major currencies.", "A highlight of the quarter was the continued strong growth of our business in the broadly defined life science and pharmaceutical market, a trend that has benefitted Waters' overall growth for the past year or so. All meaningful application segments of our pharma business performed well in the first quarter and contributed to the high-teen sales growth for this market. For research applications for large biopharmaceuticals to more classical small molecule QC testing demand for instruments, services and chemistry consumable was robust.", "As we saw in 2014 a lion share of our pharmaceutical growth came from smaller specialty and generic customers. Our global chemical analysis business at the Waters' division including food, environmental and industrial chemical markets was up 10% in the quarter. This non-life science segment strength was also seen in our TA Instruments results that I'll describe in more details shortly.", "Geographically for the Water's division sales in the U.S. were up about 20%. In the quarter we saw continued strength in life science spending and solid increases in the U.S. government and academic sales which were up 7%. Sales growth in Europe for the Water's division and at constant currency was up 13%. As in the U.S. we saw strong life science, government and academic spending.", "Turning to Asia, sales in China, our largest Asian market were up 16% with sales to life science and other private sector labs driving the overall sales growth. This marks the second quarter in a row of double-digit growth in China and this is performance more consistent with what we've seen over the long-term. Water's division's constant currency sales in Japan were flat with the prior years with strong life science and chemical industry demand offsetting a decline in public sector spending which was strong in the prior year's quarter.", "In India Waters' division sales were up at a strong double-digit pace, as we saw during 2014 the first quarter's growth in India was primarily associated with higher instrument, software and service sales to the generic drug industry. Our sales in Asian markets outside of Japan, China and India grew at a healthy mid-teens rate in the quarter.", "Our TA instrument's division saw a 14% increase in sales this quarter and geographically TA shipments were strong in most regions with the exception of Europe where the division enjoyed robust growth in the prior year's first quarter. From a product line perspective TA benefitted from strong shipments of instrument systems embodying technologies from businesses that the division recently acquired as well as from its core thermal and rheology platforms.", "Now I'll discuss some product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters' division in the quarter. The division's recurring revenues, the combination of service and consumables grew 15% at consumables growth was balanced across geographical regions with continued strong uptake of ACQUITY UPLC column offerings including our recently introduced line of CORTECS columns and for our new column chemistry tailored for protein separations.", "Waters' division service business also performed very well in the quarter and grew with a 16% rate with extra business days in the quarter benefitting our service growth by a few percentage points. Extra selling days aside, the strength in the service business was geographically balanced and was strongly correlated to general strength that we saw in our pharmaceutical life science end market.", "Waters' division instrument sales grew 15% in the first quarter. This growth was balanced between LC and LC/MS technology platforms and highlighted by continued strong uptake of the ACQUITY QDa Detector and positive uptake of new UPLC-MS systems launched in mid 2014 at the ASMS conference. Notably our Xevo TQ-S micro tandem quadrupole technology. On the new product front we started off 2015 with new launches by both the Waters' and TA Instruments division at this year's Pittsburgh Conference in March.", "Highlights of the conference included our full spectrum molecular imaging system and our GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling technology. Our new full spectrum molecular imaging system embodies the convergence of MALDI and DESI ionization technology with high performance ion mobility and Q-Tof Mass Spectrometry. New research workflows are enabled with this system with advanced software which more easily provides researchers with actionable information on the location and distribution of key chemical compounds and tissue samples.", "Our GlycoWorks labeling kit represents a major advance in Glycan analysis. Glycan's a sugar molecules bonded to protein backbones which can meaningfully affect the biological activity of protein based biopharmaceuticals. The structure, frequency and location of these bonded sugars are variable in the biosynthesis of protein based drugs and consequently are important to characterize as part of drug discovery development and quality manufacture.", "Our new GlycoWorks kit is been received by leading researches in this field as a breakthrough technology, that's exclusive to Waters. Our early customer are experiencing more comprehensive analytical results and a fraction of the time required to perform what they have perceived to be the best LCMS methodology. We believe that this technology is well suited to improve the quality testing of new biologic drugs including the QC testing of bio generics or biosimilar drugs, and may likely set a new standard for required regulatory testing. In addition, this new workflow is designed to be carried out on a tailored AQUITY UPLC system outfitted with our innovative QDa detector.", "Another first quarter 2015 development that's important to mention is an agreement that we have entered into with PerkinElmer Corporation. Under this agreement Waters will manufacture and supply chromatography components for PerkinElmer that PerkinElmer will in turn sell on service as PerkinElmer branded LC Systems to non-life science market segments.", "In addition Waters also has agreement to supply PerkinElmer within power workstations software for LC and GC applications for new as well as existing installations. We expect that this new initiative will afford Waters an opportunity to profitably grow our 2015 sales by an additional 1% or so.", "On the January call, I outlined for you our health science initiatives and some of the longer term plans that we have to position Waters as a technological leader in emerging fields of mass spectrometry based disease, characterization and diagnosis. You may recall my discussion on REIMS technology and its potential future usages for diagnostic and even surgical applications. I also mentioned that pursuing this type of opportunity represented a new type of investment for Waters one that potentially expands our business reach beyond more classical bio-analytical research segments.", "While I'm pleased to tell you that during the first quarter of 2015, we've continued to expand the funding of this strategic program. And in fact at this year's ASMS conference in St. Louis, you will begin to hear about some initial product offerings that will further indicate the trajectory and potential of this exciting initiative.", "So in summarizing this quarter's performance, I will reiterate that we are pleased with the breadth and depth of the demand for our products and services. In addition we demonstrated an ability to drive both operational and non-operational leverage and growing our earnings per share by more than 30%. Free cash flow in the quarter a metric that you know I follow closely was impressive and we generated about $0.30 of free cash flow from each dollar of sale. But before turning over to Gene, I'd like to say a few words about our non-operational plans.", "In 2015 we expect another year of strong free cash flow and anticipate continued capital deployment towards our share repurchase program. On an M&A front, it's likely that we'll continue to target smaller bolt-on businesses. On the leadership transition front, we continue to make steady progress on the search for a CEO replacement from the start of this process; we have focused on achieving a best match fit between the experience set and track record over potential successor and the unique drivers of Waters' performance.", "These drivers include commitments to technological leadership, to financial discipline and to the maintenance of close customer relationships. So please stay tuned for updates on this front and know that the successful completion of this transition process continues to be a high priority for me and for our Board of Directors.", "So on closing 2015 is off to a strong start with all segments of our business performing well. In the upcoming months we've plan to introduce a series of exciting new products which will benefit our third and fourth quarters sales. We are encouraged by the broad geographical and product line strengths that have will helped us deliver superior results in recent quarters and look forward to successfully executing our business plans throughout 2015.", "Now I'll like to turn it to Gene for a review of our financials.", "Gene Cassis", "Well thank you Doug and good morning all, at $460 million our first quarter revenues increased 15% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth in the quarter by 8% resulting in 7% reporting sales growth. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 32% to $1.21 in comparison to earnings of $0.92 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.15 compared to $0.82 last year. Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release that we issued this morning. Looking at our growth geographically and before foreign currency effects, U.S. sales were up 20%, Europe was up 10%, Japan was flat and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 20% with strong demand in India and China, rest of world sales were up 12%.", "On the product front and again in constant-currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 15% and our recurring revenues grew by 15%. So consequently the division sales were up 15%. For our TA instruments division, constant-currency sales including instruments and services increased by 14%.", "Now, I'd like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins came in at 58.9% up from 56.4% in the first quarter of last year. This improvement can be attributed to a combination of factors including higher sales volume, positive mix dynamics and successful ongoing engineering efforts aimed at reducing product manufacturing costs.", "Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 9% on a constant-currency basis. The impact of currency translation reduced SG&A by about 9%. R&D expenses increased due to our ongoing spending associated with new product development and increased incremental spending related to our health science initiative. On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14%, for the full year 2015 we expect our operating tax rate to come in at around 14% and in this projection we have not assumed the reestablishment of the United States R&D tax credit.", "In the quarter, net interest expense was $7 million and share count came in at 83.8 million shares or approximately 2.1 million shares lower than in the first quarter of last year. This is a result of our share repurchase program.", "Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.1 billion and debt came in at $1.5 billion bringing us to a net cash position of $624 million. As for first quarter share repurchases, we bought 710,000 shares of our common stock for $85 million. This leaves $684 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase programs. We define free cash flow is cash from operations less capital expenditure plus non-cash benefits from stock based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items.", "In the first quarter of 2015 free cash flow came in at $138 million after funding $21 million of capital, excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of investments associated with major facility expansion. Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 78 days in the quarter. The quarter inventories increased by $11 million reflecting normal seasonal patterns.", "Now I'll discuss our 2015 full year outlook. While we had a stronger top-line growth rate in the first quarter than we had expected. Contributing significantly to this strong start was continued strength in our pharmaceutical life science end markets. In addition, we benefited from stronger shipments of TA Instrument systems and continued positive sales momentum in China. We estimate that additional selling days in the quarter in comparison to the first quarter of last year added about 3 or 4 points to sales growth, predominantly augmenting our recurring revenue product lines.", "In the upcoming quarters of 2015, we anticipate that continued growth in sales we're broadly defined pharmaceutical life science customers, solid recurring revenue growth and stable to improving business trends in Asia will allow us to finish the year with mid single-digit sales growth before currency translation. Currency translation for the full year and assuming current exchange rates is now expected to reduce as reported sales growth by approximately 6%.", "Moving down to P&L, gross margins are expected to improve slightly from last year and came in at or around 59% for the full year 2015. We expect to manage our constant-currency operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant-currency sales growth rate. However, we anticipate that our R&D expenses will grow at a higher rate due to continued investments in new product development and incremental spending associated with our health science initiative.", "Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $31 million. Turning to share account, our full year average diluted share account is expected to be reduced an end up at around 83 million shares outstanding as a result of continued share repurchases. Rolling all this together non-GAAP earnings for full diluted share are now expected to be in the range of $5.67 to $5.87.", "As we think about our expectations for the second quarter of 2015 our guidance anticipates that constant currency sales growth will come in at or around 7%. Currency translation in the quarter is expected to reduce reported sales growth by the same rate or about 7%. This top-line performance is expected to result in non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $1.20 to a $1.30 in the quarter. Doug.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you Gene, and operator I think at this point we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you sir. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Mr. John Groberg of UBS. Sir your line is open.", "John Groberg", "I think maybe just to start off, Doug obviously you have extra selling days, easy comps, and those things; but can you maybe just talk about some of the bigger opportunities that you're seeing out there that you think are really sustainable, that have legs, beyond just the easy comps and the days? I don't know if it's biosimilars. I don't know if it's some of these new initiatives that you think are just getting off the ground. Could you maybe talk about some of the ones that you're more excited about that you think will have durability beyond just the factors ", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure John. I think there are couple of basic things, that probably are not what you are getting at but let me reiterate we're clearly seeing a recovery in Asian markets that depressed sales growth in the '13 and early '14 period and now pretty clearly we're seeing a recovery in the India generics markets and this marks the second quarter of improving conditions in China and for the most part we think those are sustainable going forward. So clearly so as some depression of that prior year's I think we're in a benevolent cycle at this point.", "If you talk more about the applications we serve and the condition of the markets, there are couple of areas, certainly the heath science initiative and all that it promises from research into biomarkers to research into the phenomics dynamics and how it affects health, we're seeing a significant amount of investment that we're intimately involved in, in the early stages of that that we think have a lot of legs in terms of the investment cycle but also can lead down the road into the whole personal medicine and diagnostic space that being on the ground floor or helping develop those discoveries will lead us further down the path into the downstream diagnostic opportunities that is part and parcel of the foundation of the whole health science initiative. So we have a very strong quarter in that whole health science area, so it's already showing promise.", "You'll hear us talk more and more about our emerging technologies that Gene pointed to and the investments that we're making in REIMS technology in the iKnife that get us further down that healthcare path, closer to actually treating some of these disease states in the future in essence broadening our ability to service customers somewhat outside of our traditional analytical laboratory, so and you're certainly seeing the science of actual progress with biosimilars and biogenerics, we're certainly seeing a great deal of interest in our new glycol-protein products that we've just talked about. It clearly is emerging appreciation of the importance of characterizing these molecules and rarely have we seen the kind of initial interest in a new product as we have seen with this GlycoWorks application that we've recently introduced. So, those are a number of the areas that evidence the enthusiasm that we're talking about now.", "John Groberg", "That's great. If I can have two quick follow-ups, can you Doug, one on the leadership transition Is there any change given your comments -- are there any change to your expectation that you'll something by August? And then other one is given the FX regime, I know on some of your competitors have actually been raising price, are trying to, what's your plan around pricing?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well in terms of pricing we don\u2019t anticipate any radical change, and certainly we balance pricing regularly, and we certainly look at pricing when we introduce a new product to try to make sure that we stay and sink across all geographic regions, but we present as a local company and all of the areas of the world that we do business, and so when currencies move against us in this phase we've got to find ways to stick with it and prove our business; and when they move for us as they clearly do in cycles, we don\u2019t radically change our pricing in those local markets, so that's been our practice over a 40 year period and it's not likely the change.", "In terms of the transition in leadership, you can clearly assume that we're being very careful, methodical and examining carefully how we execute this transition. I continues to be optimistic that we'll do it around the timing that I have talked about I'll always said that this timing was a guideline wasn't meant to be a rigid hurdle rate that I'm not going anywhere come August 1 or August 15th, whatever that two year deadline is, and in almost any circumstance you are likely here my voice for a while post August. At this point it's certainly possible that we'll have something done by August but I wouldn't bet ranch on, it may stretch longer than that.", "I continue to say, we have high quality candidates but until we're ready to actually sign on the bottom line continue to say watch this space for further notice.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Sir your line is open.", "Tycho Peterson", "Doug, I want to try to kind of get your latest thoughts on the pharma cycle. I know in the past you've kind of talked about a two-year cycle where you can see seven to eight strong quarters, and then maybe seven to eight weaker quarters. Can you maybe just talk about where you think we are in the cycle right now, your visibility to that customer base, and can you do better than mid-single growth in pharma this year?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Tycho I think partly it's an unfortunate characterization when people say pharma, they think the top 10 or 12 integrated pharmaceutical companies in the world and that group of customers says as you know, faced a lot of hurdles, they've gone through the mergers and acquisitions phase. If anything I think, we're probably come through the worst periods of reorganization and then cutting spending on that group. That's gone on for well over five years but I think, we don\u2019t see the worst of that in the future, we think the worst of that's behind us.", "On the other hand, I think the broader life science community is clearly the more dynamic piece of this market, was last year, I think will continue to be when you talk about generics, biosimilars the innovative bio-tech marketplace, the merging diagnostic discovery companies and the discovery working arm-an-arm with the therapeutic pharmaceutical customers.", "So we continued to see very robust conditions in those market places, surrounding the classical large scale ethical pharmaceutical companies. So combined we are very optimistic about the opportunity that broadly defined market place to sustain the high single-digit growth rate that we're aiming at.", "Tycho Peterson", "I just want make sure I understand some of the nuances around guidance. You beat by $0.19, you raised by $0.09 to $0.10 overall. And then on the top-line looks like you're guiding for the back half of the year to be flat organic. Is that the right way to be thinking about it? Is the lack of more upside to the bottom line reinvestment and FX?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well Gene can start off and I\u2019ll give you my tinge on it.", "Gene Cassisa", "Hi Tycho. Yes; we certainly had a nice start to the year but we also know that since we gave guidance last foreign currency dynamics have presented us with the stronger headwind. So in the first quarter results we delivered about $0.20 more than we had it originally anticipated, however, if you just look at the effect of foreign currency again applying it to the full year. You had an additional about $0.10 worth of headwind that we are dealing with, so in the guidance that we've presented going for the remainder of the year we've taken these two factors into consideration, little bit more headwind on the FX side, but acknowledging that we did have a stronger start to the year than we had anticipated.", "I would also say that as we go through the year, the largest quarter is the fourth quarter we had a particularly strong fourth quarter last year, so it probably makes sense to be a little bit more conservative on our outlook at the end of the year. Hopefully when we're talking to you again in July, we will have a higher level of visibility on business momentum towards the close of the year and be able to modify our outlook appropriately.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think Gene covered it pretty well, Tycho, I think, we clearly had a very strong first quarter even when you discounted for the base and for the extra selling days. No matter, how you estimate that effect, we're still around at 10% organic rate even if you cleansed it, so it's pretty impressive and if you look at our trailing 12 months results, we're at that 8%, 9% organic growth rate, so all of that's very encouraging but we're still being careful I would say early in the year, to not get too much ahead of ourselves. So I think it's fair to say there are current conditions could lead to better results but we want to be careful early in the year.", "Tycho Petersen", "And then just one last one, Doug. Can you comment on the 20% U.S. constant currency growth. That really stood out. You obviously had an easier comp, but was that all pharma or a TA recovery? What drove the 20% here?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, certainly the life science market was since by far the biggest market is that life science market that grew with that high double-digit rate but interestingly all the markets contributed double-digit growth rates, I think I'm right.", "Gene Cassisa", "Yes, and the other thing, Tycho, is that in the quarter in the U.S. as well as globally, you know the strength of the recurring revenues was pretty encouraging for us. Again we understand, that that revenue line benefits most from extra selling days but again even accounting for that at a minimum you're looking at what is now a pattern and a high single-digit growth rate for our recurring revenues on a constant currency basis, and that's something is very encouraging as we project out through the remainder of the year.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "As Gene mentioned that something I would like to emphasize, it's interesting that in the service and support market place in the last four or five may be plus years a number of competitors have emerged to try to address the broader service market. And essentially take share from us by servicing Waters gear around the world. And I am sure you're familiar with all of the players who advertise that they can service and support Waters and everybody else who is in the analytical libratory.", "I think it's telling that our strategy is clearly not to do that, we focus on our business, we train the best service people, we support our instruments. What that's led to is a service business that continues to grow at the double-digit pace and in this past quarter grew even much stronger than that. So I just think it's a very telling dynamic that the customer support for our strategy and the importance of that service dynamic tie directly to our business, is far in a way the fastest grower in the service business and all we do is support our own installed base. It\u2019s very interesting dynamic that we'll continue to track.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Issac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Sir your line is open.", "Issac Ro", "Gene, I had a question for you. I think kind of gone around this topic a little bit; but if you could maybe give us the growth rate you saw in your biopharma end markets versus your academic and government this quarter? It seems like it must have been a huge number, given the strength of the organic growth rate for the total company.", "Gene Cassis", "Yes, the biopharmaceutical growth rate was in the high-teens for the quarter, Issac. And looking at our government and academic spend are all in again these numbers are in constant currency was at a mid single-digit rate, but that mid single-digit includes much stronger performance in the United States and Europe and it was somewhat offset by weaker performance in Japan and still not that robust spending on the public side in China, so all in we ended up with mid single-digit government and academic but there was a definite geographic pattern to be gleaned behind that number.", "Issac Ro", "And then just a follow-up to that. I think in the past you said that the majority of your biopharma revenue tends to come from the production side versus R&D. So just given that high-teens number you offered. Is that consistent to gain consistent again here, where the implication would be that most of your growth you're seeing was really on the production side? ", "Gene Cassisa", "No, it's interesting there is another geographic story there. We had a very strong performance as Doug and I mentioned in India. And given that that is primarily a generic drug market for us that was clearly production related, but as we begin to look a little bit more broadly at this pharmaceutical space or we saw a strength and from discovery through development, so a very broad based and is very broad based geographically too. So, I'd say that the long-term trend of half of the business related to production and production related activities that 50-50 mix is not too far off, but I would just say that we saw strength in both of those broadly defined segments in the quarter.", "Issac Ro", "Last one, if I could sneak it in. If we take all that in context with what we've seen so far elsewhere from your competitors, it does seem like you took a little bit of market share this quarter, at least in biopharma. Would you agree with that statement?", "Gene Cassisa", "Well, it's always difficult to talk about market share quarter-by-quarter, our experience tends to tell us that yes market share shifts to occur but they tend to occur over a longer cycle. I think, clearly in the quarter we benefited from our heavy weighting towards life science pharmaceutical and the underlying strength of that market. I think that we are at little bit more leverage for a better derivative of that end market and maybe some other players in the space. So, longer term, I mean, again Doug had mentioned that over the last four quarters our growth rate has been at the high single-digit level. And I think you can look at the growth rate of the industry as a whole and some of our competitors and you can make the assessment as you wish on that front.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Mr. Bryan Brokmeier of Maxim Group. Sir your line is open.", "Bryan Brokmeier", "In your prepared remarks you attributed the strong margin to volume positive mix dynamics and engineering efforts, improved manufacturing costs. How much of the margin expansion would you attribute to each of those?", "Gene Cassisa", "It's actually pretty well balanced on that front. The results for the quarter where you saw in our nice 200 basis point improvement and gross margins compared to the prior year result. It just demonstrates how -- with the positive sensitivity is of our gross margin to volume. But I'd say in the quarter we had nice contributions from volume from product mix and part of that mix includes a nice strong performance from our TA group that has a wonderful profitably profile, so I would say looking at those factors probably volume and mix were the biggest components on top that, we ended up benefiting from some of our cost improvement efforts.", "Bryan Brokmeier", "And despite the really strong revenue, SG&A was flat year-over-year. Was all of that through cost containment, as well, or were there any delays in needed expenses, or delays in additions to your head count that we'll see causing increase in expenses over the next few quarters?", "Gene Cassisa", "Actually if we look at the business in constant currency we're able to grow to top line 15% in constant currency with 9% SG&A growth rate, so it's impressive leverage. But we did grow our SG&A again in constant currency by 9%, what you are also seeing is the effective weaker euro and recognizing that we have a meaningful spend in Europe. We also saw benefits from the pound on that front too, some costs. So as you begin to look at the actual SG&A growth, the main reason why it was flat is because we benefited on the operating expense side from lower yen and from the lower euro and from the lower pound.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Mr. Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Sir your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin", "There's been a lot of noise and potential consolidation activity being discussed in sort of like in the spec pharma space and the generic space. I know Teva is one of your largest customers. I guess when you save all the combinations and possibilities going on in the spec back in that market, do you -- is there any one particular area combination that would make you nervous? Is there any potential impact in terms of how people deploy their fleets of LCs in that? I'm trying to think of how you see all this -- how you think all the generic and spec pharma consolidation is going to play out to your business?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Derik, I think it is true that when the large ethical pharma companies went through that binge of merging, they ultimately cut R&D and that ultimately -- certainly had a short-term affect on demand. So we clearly saw a blip down after a big merger with those big ethical pharmaceutical companies. And the ones that you're talking about with Teva and Mylan and Perrigo, much less likely to see a significant impact, because those are driven off production, most of our sales to those customers are pill count. And so you are not going to see a significant change in pill count and unlikely to see a significant impact related to those of kinds of companies.", "Derik de Bruin", "And then one quick follow-up. Was there any significant bulk purchases during the quarter? I know you've got some stuff with the UK's Phenome Centre. I know there were some potential grants that are pending for that. Was there any unusual volume purchases in the quarter in mass spec or LC?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "No.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Paul Knight of Janney Capital Markets. Sir your line is open.", "Paul Knight", "Doug you seem very excited about GlycoWorks. Could you talk a little more about it? Is there anybody you see on the horizon that could offer anything comparable? I guess quantifying it, was it a lot of your growth, or is it just rolling out now?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Paul, it's really just rolling out now. I have Art sitting next to me who, if I let him speak, he'd have you convinced it's going to change the nature of the western world, so he might break in here any minute any way, but we are extraordinarily excited about it. I think I said it's certainly unusual that we have seen the amount of customer reaction to the introduction of this product. The reaction of our field force who -- it's a premium price product and they might even be telling us we're under pricing it, it is so strong and so good in the customers eyes. However it was just introduced at Pittcon, so we didn't see any real economic impact of it in the first quarter. But I will unleash Art in here and let him chime in on how he feels about this.", "Art Caputo", "And I'll try not to be too extravagant for Doug here. But I think the reason for our optimism for this particular chemistry and keep in mind that most of our innovations and impact in the market place originated chemistry. UPLC originated as a chemistry advance. This particular application predominantly in the biopharmaceutical life science arena, where our customers are producing biologically based drugs, glycan testing is pervasive requirement.", "It's done from research, through development and through the production process and it's an FDA requirement. And so understanding the glycan profile of a biological is of extreme importance. The existing technology that laboratory's conduct today takes more than a day to prepare samples, its costly, keep in mind there are millions of samples run per year. The technology that we have is exclusive proprietary and it reduces the analysis time down to roughly hours, hour compared to whole day.", "It enables you to detect by both fluorescence and mass spectrometry so it provides a lot more information keeping in mind it's a critical assay to characterize the glycan content. It affects the quality of these drugs, so there are two attributes to these. One is, it greatly improves the productivity of the assay, number one and number two it improves the quality and the content of the information you get.", "So considering that we just launched this, there is standing room only and we've actually had to rebook seminars, the early responses from the primary users of this technology is been outstanding. So we're more excited about it, what's even more exciting besides it being a renewable, repeatable chemistry business is that we're seeing that a lot of analytical products are particular QDa which is our benchtop mass spectrometer when combined with this chemistry is a very attractive analytical tool for those in the research and development side of the equation.", "So for us, it's in early stages, we're in a development phase, but the early acceptance of this is quite exciting and I don't see think we've seen a chemistry product since the introduction of UPLC that it has raised such an excitement level in what is a fairly attractive segment in the market place right now, where this type of requirement is necessary. So that's the essence of the opportunity and the additional response is outstanding. Does that cover it Paul?", "Paul Knight", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Sir your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel", "My first question has two parts, and is specific to China. I think you indicated China revenue grew 16% year-over-year in the quarter in the Waters' division. Commentary has clearly been really encouraging. The first part of the question is when you say growth is improving, are you just pointing at growth relative to a favorable comp or do you believe that China is actually improving, as measured relative by demand over the last couple of quarters. And the second part is does your full-year guidance still embed the assumption that China revenue grows at mid-single-digit levels, or is there some change to that, given strong Q1 performance? ", "Gene Cassis", "Doug this is Gene. We're impressed with having mid-teens growth rate in China now for two quarters in a row. And if I take a look at the drivers of growth in that country, it's a little bit more weighted towards the for profit customer and we're still seeing a little bit slower than historical demand from governmentally funded laboratories but we are somewhat encouraged by what we're hearing about governmental spending plans during this next fiscal year. I would say that as we begin to look at the combination of India and China and make assumptions about how those businesses will impact, our full year 2015 outlook, we're at least set a high single-digit level given strong start we have this year, so far early indications for demand in the second quarter looked like a continuation of the trends that we saw in the first quarter. So I would say that in looking at the geographical components that make up our full year guidance we're probably a little bit more bullish on Asia in general and India and China in particular.", "Doug Schenkel", "Another multi-parter, this time on the pharma end market. Just to clarify as a follow-up to a few earlier questions, what percentage of sales did say top 20 accounts account for today? I think that's probably down around 10%, which is considerably lower than it was last time we went through anything resembling a consolidation period. The second question, second part, is could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of replacement versus new customer placements within the pharma end market? And the third part is, how correlated do you think biopharma growth is right now with the strong equity market conditions that exist in terms of financing these companies right now?", "Gene Cassisa", "I'll start off, but you have to remind me Doug, what exactly was the first question that you started with?", "Doug Schenkel", "Top 20 pharma as a percentage of total sales?", "Gene Cassisa", "You're estimate is right on, I think as you know, if I go back a decade our top 15 accounts represented about a quarter of our business and now you're looking at around 10% of our sales from our top 15. So it is kind of interesting because those top 15 are actually companies that are the result of mergers that have occurred in this period, so in some ways it's even more dramatic. It's, when me talk about the top 15, it talks about the amount of business that we transact directly with those accounts.", "But I have to say that those accounts also are more frequently over the years have used outsourcing, so some of the money that we're getting from CRO accounts, from small specialty pharmaceuticals, some of the funding may actually be coming from some of those large multinationals, so that's another factor to consider.", "Looking at the replacement versus new, I mean one metric to consider is just looking at the number of HPLC versus UPLC systems that we're selling. And over the last few quarters, the growth rate in our alliance based HPLCs has been comparable to the growth rate that we've seen in the ACQUITY. That's an indicator that you're seeing both a strong replacement cycle as well as expansion of the business.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think in general Doug; you can look at the strength that we're seeing in the biotech, the innovative piece. The Gilead's of the world, et cetera, and say most of that's growth driven. You look at the large pharma and India for instance, some of that certainly on the big pharma that's a fair amount of replacement because we know they've delayed, delayed, delayed in a multi-year period and we've talked about pent-up replacement demand. We\u2019re seeing some of that, we still think that there's more to come. So I think, yes we're seeing pretty good replacement demand in the big pharma world, but a lot of the novel life science segment is just growth in their applications.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is open.", "Steve Beuchaw", "First on the expanded relationship with Perkin; thanks for the commentary there around your expectation for that to contribute about a point of growth. I wonder if that point of growth that you referred to -- is that a proxy for how this evolves over the medium term or does that reflect the -- let's call it early days of that relationship? And then maybe Gene or John, could you give us a sense for how that revenue gets booked, and how that revenue flows through the P&L, what might be the impact on margins?", "John Lynch", "Steve in terms of what it could mean and I think -- the points probably a fair estimate and might be on the conservative side. I don\u2019t think it will be less than that; but where early days of this relationship, the very interesting thing and the reason why we were enthusiastic about entering into this deal is that we're dealing with customers that almost universally we haven't dealt within the past. So these are customers that PE has serviced as a broad range supplier. They go in and outfit an industrial laboratory with a whole series of technologies and those customers typically want to deal with perhaps with only one supplier. PE has not traditionally been one of the major suppliers of HPLC or UPLC, so, I think it became more and more expensive for them to maintain a development program. And so the fit between Waters and PE turned out to be a nice fit of the various requirements and we get this volume without having to support it -- at very much on an SG&A basis.", "So, the margins are very good and it doesn\u2019t cause those barely anything on the SG&A line. And I think we're reasonably optimistic that this can grow a little bit faster, if we're right about the debt. So, Gene do you have anything.", "Gene Cassis", "No, I think you characterized here well. If this is the situation where I truly believe it's a win-win situation. Our colleagues in PerkinElmer wanted to really have high performance workhorse instruments to supply to their customer base and if I look at the portfolio of products that we are providing to them; I think they fit that category very well and also these are products that have been very effectively cost-engineered and are manufactured in Singapore largely for us too, so that\u2019s another advantage in that, it increases our footprint in a very cost favored and tax favored production side.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Then one quickly on TA. How did the business track through the quarter from your point of view? Was it as strong exiting the quarter as it was for the full quarter? Then I'll jump back in queue.", "Gene Cassisa", "TA had a very solid first quarter and I mentioned earlier in response to a question as that, not only was the sales growth rate but you also saw nice improvement in the profitably of the business. Looking at the division, the growth benefited from new technologies that we had acquired over the past couple of years as well as from the core business in rheology and thermal analysis. And I'd say that looking across the quarter we saw pretty consistent results across the quarter and are pretty encouraged as we go into the second quarter and look towards the remainder of the year.", "Operator, I think we've past the bottom of the hour, so, we'll take one more question and then wrap it up.", "Operator", "Sir, our next question comes from Mr. Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Sir your line is open.", "Steve Willoughby ", "Just a couple of housekeeping questions, first, I understand for your guidance for the full year the increased FX impact. Am I also correct to assume that your tax rate guidance is going up slightly? Secondly, the extra selling days you had here in the first quarter, is there an offset to that in the back half of the year? You did 15% organic growth and then guiding to 7%. Obviously it would relate to a pretty meaningful slow-down in organic growth in the back half to get to that mid-single-digit guidance for the full year? ", "Gene Cassisa", "I'll start with the second question and then move to the first question. You're absolutely right, as we look at the second half of the year, the base of comparison becomes a little bit more challenging and that we had a very strong second half in 2014. And looking at the number of days we do have fewer selling days in the fourth quarter. But I'd say that one of the things about a fourth quarter is that you do have the December 31st and requirement that people do allocate their capital spending, actually this is probably a little bit more of an advantage to the selling days in the first quarter and that as people release capital budgets, you might be able to get a little bit more towards the end of the quarter.", "But, you are absolutely right that we are going to be more conservative on our outlook for the fourth quarter due to a combination of the stronger base of comparison and to the fewer selling days. Looking at the tax rate, the tax rate that's embedded in our forecast is 14%. We had a tax rate last year that was a point better than that. The difference being that last year the U.S. R&D tax credit was enacted and we were able to take advantage of that, if that happens again this year our tax rate should be roughly the same as it was in 2014.", "Steve Willoughby ", "Gene just one quick follow-up on the tax rate. Is there any update regarding your tax structure in Singapore?", "Gene Cassis", "It continues to move in a very positive direction, there's a feeling that the long-term benefits that the Singaporean government is looking for and our desires they are all very well aligned. So I see nothing that makes me uncomfortable about a continued very favorable relationship that results in a favorable tax position over the next multi-year period.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you. And thank you all for being with us on this first call of 2015 and we'll look forward to updating you after the second quarter. Thank you all.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference.

(NYSE:WAT) Q3 2007 Earnings Call October 23, 2007  9:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and CEO", "John Ornell - VP, Finance and Administration and CFO", "Analysts", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Derik deBruin - UBS Warburg (US)", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "John L. Sullivan - Leerink Swann & Company", "Operator", "Good morning. Welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. The conference is being recorded; if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. And good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter financial results conference call. With me on today's call as usual, is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. And as is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter's highlights and then John will follow with details on our financial results and provide you with an outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2007.", "But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language. John?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the Company; this time for Q4, 2007.", "We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events, results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, in Part I under the caption Business Risk Factors.", "We further caution you that the Company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for January 2008.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached in the Company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of restructuring, purchased intangible amortization and retirement plan transition charges.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. Well, the third quarter results largely indicate a continuation of positive trends that we saw through the first half 2007. And among these trends are improved spending for our global accounts, the expansion of our businesses in Asia and generally healthy industrial demand. In addition, our global business with government and university entities continued to do very well. In all, from a product line, customer segment and geographical point of view, there were no significant surprises with all these segments reporting solid results.", "So I turn first to our larger accounts. I would describe their spending as improved but not totally robust. Our overall pharmaceutical demand was strong in the quarter, driven again by generic CRO and specialty pharmaceutical customers. Among the large ethical houses we saw the majority improving considerably over last year's sales levels. However, uncertainties in a couple of large firms weighed down on the Group as a whole this quarter. As we come into the fourth quarter, we are more optimistic that year-end spending specifically on our two technology systems will result in a sales pick up for this large customer segment.", "Geographically, our largest market, the United States continued to perform well with strong double-digit growth. Contributing to the U.S. performance was accelerated demand from pharmaceutical and university customers. Outside the Unites States, the only really major market where we saw some softness in demand was in Japan. We think this weakness appeared related to a general economic condition and we are confident that our competitive position in Japan remains strong and that our sales there are likely to pick up as general spending conditions improve.", "If you look at our businesses in Asia outside of Japan; China and India are continuing to drive our growth with each of those territory showing strong year-over-year performance. Our recent business reviews in China and India suggests that current growth rate appears sustainable as these countries continue to modernize and build scientific infrastructure, and we continue to invest in people and infrastructure right along with them.", "Elsewhere, demand in Europe was strong for the quarter led by continued growth in our business in government, environmental and food testing laboratories.", "As you look at our major product lines, our instrumentation systems growth in the Waters Division continues to be driven by the up tick in ACQUITY UPLC and ACQUITY LCMS systems. Customer feedback on the performance, reliability and broad applicability of ACQUITY UPLC continues to be very favorable and the advantages of combining UPLC technology with mass spec characterization appear well established in the marketplace.", "Mass spectrometry related system sales grew nicely in the quarter, led by our high resolution Synapt and Q-Tof line and our quadrupole-based detective systems. Synapt HTMS technology seems to be driving a revolution in mass spectrometry as customers exploit new and exciting ways to utilize the technology and applications that range from protein structure and function studies to high sensitivity impurity profiling for biopharmaceuticals.", "New capabilities that we introduced for Synapt at this year's ASMS, were well received especially the MALDI source option that enables broader application reach for the system. So the first nine months of this year, its clear to us that there is healthy momentum in spending for mass spectrometry technology, and that we are increasingly well positioned with our recent exciting product margins to gain share in this market. We are optimistic that these trends in MS-related demand will continue through the fourth quarter of '07 and we also feel that the exciting new product launches that we have planned for 2008 will further strengthen our market position.", "As many of you know, we are more than a supplier of advanced instrumentation and that we offer a broad line of chromatography consumables and advanced instrument services. In fact, these sources of profitable recurring revenues are approaching almost half of our sales revenue. In the third quarter, we grew our recurring revenues at a double-digit rate as we benefited from the strong up tick of ACQUITY columns by our expanding base of ACQUITY UPLC customers.", "This strength that we have developed in designing and selling advanced consumables and services is surely a key to Waters competitive advantage. There is no better example of this than the success of ACQUITY UPLC, where with the advances in the packing material chemistry, they really resulted in a new category of instrumentation that is transforming and invigorating this marketplace.", "If you look at our TA Instruments business, we are very pleased with the third quarter results, as this division continues to capture larger shares of the thermal analysis and rheology markets. You may recall that TA represents about 10% of our corporate sales. However, their continuous ability to positively and profitably contribute to the Corporation's overall growth has been very impressive, particularly recently.", "During the quarter, we added another business to the TA portfolio, Calorimetry Sciences Corporation, which is a manufacturer of microcalorimetry instruments that have capabilities to compliment on line of analytical systems that we introduced last year following the acquisition of thermal metrics.", "Before passing you on to John to review the financials, I'd like to say that 2007 has shaped up as a very successful year for Waters in just about every perspective. Our products are performing well in the marketplace and appear to be driving gains and share. And our financial results relying principally on organic sales growth continued to set the pace for the industry.", "I would like to briefly review with you a couple of principles today that have and will continue to drive our success. Importantly, we focus on the most relevant and attractive segments of the analytical business. And at time when some companies try for breadth of product offerings and benefits from economies of scale, I think we have demonstrated the advantages of continuously working to be the best in delivering advanced system based solutions, systems that uniquely merge technologies to deliver superior information content and efficiency. I believe that over the past couple of years, we have evolved in the eyes of our customers to become a premier solutions provider and technology partner, the only company to advance unique offerings such as ACQUITY UPLC and Synapt HDMS.", "On the acquisition front, we stayed close to our comfort zone and look for companies and technologies that are synergistic with our current operations and quickly accretive to both our top line and profitability. Financially, we carefully evaluates the near and long-term implications of our investments and work hard to deliver superior gross margins, operating margins, earnings growth and free cash flow, results that we can deliver today while working towards future improvements.", "Now look at cash flow, and I feel it's one of the clearest and most objective measures of a company's performance, and when you come down to it, it is what all companies strive for in the long run and its what Waters is delivering at an outstanding level today. This year, we expect our free cash flow will be over 20% of sales. This level of operational efficiency gives us flexibility to invest in our future while providing our investors with unmatched levels of confidence and our ability to leverage investments, acquisition, share repurchases or internal development programs.", "As an investor whether you are considering investing in the analytical market or more broadly in public equities, I feel there are few companies that offer the top line growth, earnings growth and strong cash flow than we have consistently provided and plan to deliver in the years ahead.", "Now with that, I would like to turn it over to John for more detailed financial affairs.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay thank you, Doug and good morning every one. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial performance with third quarter results delivering 17% growth in sales and 24% growth in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. Earnings per share was $0.62 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.50 last year.", "On a GAAP basis, our results this quarter include $12.2 million charge related to the U.S. transition from a defined benefit pension plan to a 401(k) plan as described in our 8-K filing last month. After tax, this charge amounts to $0.08 per fully diluted share. Our GAAP earnings were $0.52 this quarter compared to $0.49 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in the press release issued this morning.", "Sales grew 17% this quarter with currency providing 3 percentage points of growth and acquisitions providing about 2 points. Examining corporate sales regionally before foreign exchange effects, our sales results were positive in our major geographies, with continued strength in Asia where we saw a 12% increase this quarter versus a difficult base of comparison.", "Sales within Europe were also up 12%, and in the U.S. sales continued to be very strong and grew by 18%. Sales to most of our large pharmaceutical accounts continue to be a positive momentum and global sales to smaller pharma and biotech customers remain robust.", "Turning to the product front, the Waters Division had another strong quarter with instrument systems growth of 12%. Our service business grew by 7% and chemistry had 19% growth, which was aided by acquisitions. Without acquisitions, our chemistry business grew by 10%. And our TA instruments division had another strong quarter, with sales up 37% versus prior year resulting from strong new product sales as well as the favorable base of comparison. M&A activity contributed above 5% to this result.", "Now, I would like to comment on non-GAAP margins and expenses excluding items noted in this morning's press release. Gross margins came in as expected at 57.1% this quarter. Margins were up sequentially this quarter, but down from last year due primarily to continuing foreign exchange cost pressure on European-sourced products.", "SG&A expenses grew at a rate less than sales, and were up 12% this quarter compared to prior year. Foreign exchange translation and acquisitions accounted for about 5% of this growth. R&D spending was up modestly this quarter.", "Our effective tax rate this quarter was 14.8% on a GAAP basis. However, on a pro forma basis, our effective tax rate was 18.6% this quarter. This quarter's rate reflects the impact of a year-to-date catch-up of an increase in the full year projected tax rate moving from 15 to 16.2%, as well as a couple of smaller discreet items booked within the third quarter. The rate increase is the result of improved profitability in our higher tax rate geographies.", "On the stock buyback front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market and during the third quarter, we purchased 402,000 shares of our common stock for $24 million.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short term investments totaled $626 million, bringing us to a net debt position of about $284 million. We believe we remain well positioned to fund our future working capital needs and acquisition opportunities.", "We measure free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any non-tax... non-cash tax benefit from FAS 123R accounting. For the quarter, free cash flow was $72 million after funding $18 million of CapEx and adding back $9 million of FAS 123R tax benefits. Comparable free cash flow last year was $50 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow has exceeded full year 2006. Year-to-date, free cash was $241 million after funding 45 million of CapEx and adding back $19 million of FAS 123R tax benefits. 2006 full year free cash flow was $229 million.", "Accounts receivable, days sales outstanding stood at 70 days this quarter, up 2 days versus Q3 last year, all due to currency effects year-over-year. Inventories increased $13 million with currency representing about $3 million of the increase.", "Now I would like to turn to our updated outlook for 2007. Our business prospects remain strong with our end markets and geographies enjoying strong customer demand. Our expectations for the fourth quarter are essentially unchanged from our July guidance. We expect sales growth of 12% for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect a combination of improved gross margins and operating expense leverage to provide for operating margin of around 30%.", "Net interest expense is expected to be around $6.5 million for the quarter and we expect our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter to be 15.9%. And the fully diluted outstanding shares are likely to be comparable to Q3 balances. Rolling all this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings of $1.06 for fully diluted share for the quarter with normal tolerance of $0.01 to $0.02 for the quarter. For full year 2007 then, we expect non-GAAP earnings of $2.84 per fully diluted share with the normal tolerance of $0.01 to $0.02 for the fourth quarter. This represents 24% earnings growth over last year. Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. I think operator, at this point we can open up for Q&A.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time we are ready for the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question, Quintin Lai, Robert W. Baird; your line is open.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "Good morning, congratulations on a nice quarter.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Quintin.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "Diving into your large accounts and your outlook for the fourth quarter, what gives you that optimism for the sales pick up especially from, I guess, those two accounts that were a little sluggish. Was it a summer seasonal thing or are you running some kind of backlog number that you are kind of going into Q4 with?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Couple of reasons... there are couple of reasons why we are reasonably optimistic about what we are looking for in the fourth quarter. The magic of quarterly performance Quintin is that the third quarter of '06 for those couple of large accounts were disproportionately large in the base. So, in the fourth quarter you don't have such a big hurdle to come over with those accounts. And secondarily, if you look at the procurement pattern this year versus what they tell us is coming in the fourth quarter and specific programs that we are working with them on, we have a reasonably higher level of expectation that those quotes are going to result in real orders in the fourth quarter. Now, we're short of absolutely guaranteeing that but, we feel pretty good about our ability to make a forecast in that matter.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "And then with respect to just the overall trends that you are seeing, it looks like that all your product lines are showing really good growth. Can you parse out what you think that the underlying market dynamics are and whether you are growing in line with that or do you have any dynamics of market share gains in special like in mass spec?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a very good question and I guess, the short answer is, we think we are gaining share and specifically in a couple of areas. It seems little doubt that the result of our ACQUITY UPLC strategy and technology introduction has gained overall market share, I mean its still to the point where we don't think that there is really good meaningful competition for that product and that's what our customers continue to tell us.", "And I think if you look at an another big segment of our marketplace, which is the mass spectrometry product lines, I don't think that there is any doubt in overall Synapt and our overall high-end mass spectrometry is gaining market share today and I think that the market is growing as fast as we are.", "If you look at areas like Asia, well, I think we are very much holding our own and doing very well. I think the overall markets in China and India are growing pretty fast, so wouldn't surprise me that others in the market are growing fast also. But you roll all that together, it seems to me that its high to add up everybody's numbers as you know in this market and absolutely on a quarter-by-quarter, get market share. But I don't have a lot of doubt that overall the net result of those dynamics is that we are a little further ahead than [Technical difficulty]", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ross Muken of Deutsche Bank; your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. So could you just talk a bit about the sustainability that you mentioned relative to some of the emerging markets and so talk about the mix there? Is it the same sort of customers that are ordering in China and India that were ordering 6 or 12 months ago? Have we seen sort of a broadening out of demand across industry segments, both being pharma and industrial?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I think if you look at the current areas of the world that are growing the most quickly and I shouldn't hasten to say that one of our fastest growing areas in the world right now is United States. So it's interesting that we see so much strength in the U.S. and I do think that that's sustainable in the U.S. over the next 12 months. But if you look at the very fast growing areas of China, India, Eastern Europe and particularly also the Middle East, places like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, as the dynamics that are going that is specifically of India and China, we don't see any real near term likelihood that this business stops growing at the rates that we are experiencing. As I said, we have... we spent a lot of time with the senior management group at Waters on India and China in particular recently. We see that it is possible that those areas might accelerate rather than decelerate.", "The amount of projects that are being laid out in front of us in terms of the need for instrumentation and if you look at India, you're talking particularly about the pharmaceutical industry, weighted towards generic drugs. And these are programs that are on the drawing board and are already under construction, so its not things its pie in the sky. If you look at China, it's a little bit different case. In China, our business is not heavily weighted towards generic drugs or pharmaceutical in total. It's a... it's a much different mix of environmental, food safety, governmental laboratories and pharmaceutical and once again, if you look at the projects just going on in the broadly described food safety and environmental areas in China, those projects look very hard to cancel or to slow down, so I'd say our near end optimism I think is very well grounded in these areas that are growing the fastest, not saying that you can't have a hiccup here or there, but I'd say that we're pretty confident that the underlying factors are pretty sustainable.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And just quickly as a follow up, I think your comment you made regarding the U.S. was pretty interesting. It's sort of the flip flop of what you would have expected given the weak dollar and every thing that we hear about sort of U.S. industrial demand and across many industries being a bit slower now than it was two quarters ago. Can you just give a little bit of granularity on sort of what's the key components of that, especially with the comments around sort of a mixed bag from pharma. Should we just assume then that it's European pharma that's weak or what is really sort of behind that extremely strong and impressive U.S. growth?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes I think again it's a good question. The... I believe that our U.S. performance to what's driving it is more Waters-centric than market centric, it's not a necessarily a broad-based dynamic. I think it's the investments in this whole evolution that I talked about of Waters as a system supplier with advanced technology that focuses on solutions. We, to some I'm sure that sounds like marketing slogan, it's real. We have spent an enormous amount of time, we always have but it seems like in the past year or so even more talking to the senior managers of our key customers and this... and I think ACQUITY UPLC had a lot to do with it where the ability of that technology to make a significant difference in a lot of the work flows of our customers has really been driven home.", "And we've talked about the fact that this is getting penetration, that it's changing the way customers think and feel and I think you are seeing that and you are seeing across big pharma in the U.S. and you're seeing it across CROs and smaller specialty pharmaceuticals. Also seeing penetration of this in our mass spec technology, particularly in the U.S. into the university marketplace, where a lot of advanced research is going on and they are looking for that improved sensitivity and improved efficiency of those technologies to drive their cutting edge research. So, I think that's what's going in the U.S. market and you would expect kind of that to the early adopter marketplace. It's not that we are not seeing that in areas of Europe, but I am secured saying we are seeing the front edge, the front part of that wave in the U.S.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Derik deBruin of UBS; your line is open.", "Derik deBruin - UBS Warburg (US)", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik deBruin - UBS Warburg (US)", "Hey. When you talk about the 12% growth in the fourth quarter for the top line, is that all in or just the organic number?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "That's all in. That would represent probably a couple of points of foreign exchange and may be about a point of acquisition impact.", "Derik deBruin - UBS Warburg (US)", "Okay, great. When... you talked about some new products in 2008, any color you want to give us?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I was afraid I was going to get that question, Derik. I think what I am comfortable about saying is we are really feeling good about what's on our plate in the mass spectrometry area. You saw us introduce last year the TQD and this is the year one down of Synapt and you are seeing the rewards of that come through in our mass spec area. We clearly feel like we've got good strong momentum in that area, clearly takes advantage of the ACQUITY UPLC as the front part of that system and we are driving that through our R&D programs right now and I'd say that's what I am most comfortable about saying. Watch for ASMS and even at PITTCON next year to see some significant mass spectrometry come into the play.", "Derik deBruin - UBS Warburg (US)", "Great, although I don't know if I am ready to start thinking about PITTCON yet. So when you... can you give us a little bit of color in terms of how big an impact are you seeing from some of the issues on food and consumer product safety? In particularly, I am curious is this been more companies that are buying stuff because they are worried about protecting the brand or is it... is it being government regulations driven right now?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say its an interesting mix of the applications that we are seeing across the world in food safety. A lot of our current business in Asia is I would say regulatory-driven and that's largely driven by European regs, as those producers in Asia have to meet the vigorous European requirements for food imports. We are also seeing a fair amount of food and beverage business that is probably not so much safety related as it is QC and competitive information related, so that's under that broad heading of food and agricultural and that's quite sustainable and unrelated to any safety concerns.", "I'd say the most current attention on the safety... on the food safety issues is increased visibility in the United States. I wouldn't say that we have seen the big bowls of actual investment in that area, I think that's probably the biggest area of opportunity in the next couple of years because that will focus probably on an increased regulation on requirements for imported food. But I wouldn't say that we're actually seeing that in our order rate, I would say most of our business is coming out of the QA/QC, a part of the food and beverage business, as well as established laboratories there are just meeting increased demands largely in the Asia theater.", "Derik deBruin - UBS Warburg (US)", "Okay. And I guess one final question, as you start to accumulate cash, it doesn't sound like you are going to be particular aggressive in your buyback strategies. I guess you pay down debt or is there the potential for a larger M&A move on the horizon?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say... we never say there is not a potential for a larger M&A, we... but our fundamental strategy is to continue to add to our portfolio with things that are digestible and that add to our overall strategic product portfolio. We are not looking for a major defining acquisition frankly, we think this business can continue to grow at good double-digit rates and produce share holder returns that are amongst the best in industry.", "We continue to think that our stock is a good buy, we are continuing to buy. We will evaluate that as the stock approaches triple-digits, but I would say right now we are... we think what we've been doing continues to have a high degree of attractiveness for us.", "Derik deBruin - UBS Warburg (US)", "Right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Jon Groberg of Merrill Lynch; your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jon.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Just a few fairly quick questions. I mean, last quarter you mentioned that UPLC demand would approach that of HPLC, I think was your word. I just wonder where we were with that and maybe get some context what percent of LCs sold this quarter with UPLC versus HPLC.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well Jon, we are not currently providing that kind of competitive information, but what I'm comfortable... I think the line that I've used in the past is that UPLC was growing north of 25% and less than a 100%. I'll be wiling to say now narrowing that range a bit growing more than 30%, less than a 100%. It's continuing to do very, very well. It's not showing any signs of coming of, it's very fast growth trajectory. And interestingly enough, HPLC while not growing anywhere near that rate, continues to grow. So, there is no question that if we're right, those curves are going to cross at some point in the next couple of years but...", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "But we're not there yet.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Not there yet.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And that's just despite very fast growth in UPLC.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And just a follow-up on that. As it grows as quickly, you've mentioned before a very high attach rates primarily because these are being used in R&D. And are they still mainly going into R&D and sort of the attach rate for the new columns still kind of 90%ish or is that coming off some, as they move into different applications?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No, the consumables rate on the new systems is very high with per system. You are seeing that in the ACUITY column growth that is very close to 100% annually. So we are very happy about how the customers are responding to the consumables with the UPLC technology.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Does that answer your question?", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, yes. And then on the financials, a quick question. Gross margins came in line with what we were expecting, you obviously got very good leverage out of SG&A into growth and R&D. I am just wondering about the sustainability of the SG&A and R&D kind of levels or trajectories relative to the revenue growth that you are seeing. I mean is this the type of leverage that you expect kind of as we go out into '08 or do you see a need to may be as you're looking back over the years and the level that you are reaching always in the third quarter of SG&A as a percentage of sales are getting low? And just maybe you can mention qualitatively if you think you are going to need to invest more in SG&A and R&D as we look out into '08?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes I think, if we look at our traditional model, we generally look at ourselves as being about a 10% top line company, top line growth company. Certainly, we are beyond that this year and we have invested in SG&A at a higher rate than we would historically to support that growth. But as we look to next year, we would... at this stage, we are expecting double-digit top line growth again. And I would submit that early on we should still be able to create a couple of points gap between the growth in SG&A and growth in sales for the next year, right in the middle of the budget process, but I would feel comfortable saying that that type of a GAAP ought to be created as we look at the needs for investment in SG&A going forward.", "I think on the R&D front however, you are looking at a year this year, even our investing in headcount that isn't obvious as you look at the financial results and R&D is growing somewhat anemically this year, but its really due to a phase of comparison where last year there were significant investments made like in three large mass spec problems that were going through the pipeline. So I would say that you are looking at a kind of a point off the line this year and rather small growth in R&D and our expectation going forward would be to grow R&D about equal to sales as we look at some of the projects that were on tap for 2008.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And, then last two quick questions. One, just if you can give any update, I know the Flextronics Solectron merger was completed in the beginning of October and that was one thing you were kind of waiting just to see how that shook out before you made your plans grow more to Singapore. I was wondering if you could comment on that. And then the second quick one on buy backs, Derik alluded to, any particular reason given the cash that you generated, I think you bought back around 70 million last quarter and about 20 million or so this quarter, just any reason for that decline?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "There's no reason, no principle reason for the decline. It doesn't signal any fundamental change in our buy back.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "And, I think on that front we have talked about may be a couple hundred million dollars this year of buyback and reserving may be a 100 millionish for M&A. We front end loaded that given where the stock price was let's say, for a full year basis we're principally on target for December for what we said we are going to do.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And, on the Flextronics front, we've had further discussions in terms of our strategic positioning in Asia. I'd say right now we are reasonably secure in planning to pursue and proceed with that overall plan and think that over the next couple of years, you'll see us build up our Asia position, much the way we had intended to do with Solectron.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan; your line is open.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Good morning.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Michael.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Wondering if you can comment at a little bit may be on pricing trends here, it sounds like a lot of commentary generally has been about growth overseas and then may be in areas such as generics and then obviously in the applied markets like food testing and... how do we think about the pricing dynamics there? You've a very good job refreshing the portfolio, at that kind of high end. But how do we think about what the pricing dynamics are like as your customer base evolves?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think there has always been a level of price competition in our industry particularly if you look at our chromatography marketplace. There have always been players who choose to compete based on a cheaper system, and some of these surprisingly larger competitors sometimes adopt that strategy. We have never really utilized a low price strategy even to gain share, I think we've been remarkably consistent really certainly for the last 20 years if... in following a differentiation approach to our marketplace. And if you look at our gross margins, and you look at our financial performance, you can see that there is very little in the way of price erosion and I think that's still true and it's a strategy, it's a result of our strategy as opposed to anything else.", "And I don't see a dynamic evolving that's really challenging that. Our UPLC products, our HPLC products are holding very firmly in the marketplace, yes, this forever some moaning from our field about customers that are giving away their products etcetera, but no level of noise that's any different from what we hear in an average quarter.", "If you look at the emerging areas of the world, the prices have held consistently and yes, there is competition there, but we hone to our fundamental strategy of bringing a system solution to the customer and it's a remarkably effective strategy regardless of where we go, whether its India, China or New Jersey, its been very effective and in well conditioned, so I don't see its changing.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay. And I think in your comments, you do mentioned, you are talking a lot more to senior managers and moving up the value chain within your respective customers. Is this naturally driving a lot more bundling and then second follow up to that is, is there an increased need then to expand the service offering and kind of propound on your broader portfolio?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think so. I mean I think it's... certainly ACUITY UPLC has a lot to do with it. And not say this also, if you at these large accounts, there is a growing appreciation that they need to do things differently and they are under enormous pressure from generics and from regulators. They need to do better in terms of the data needs and tying together all there operations, they need to drive productivity and efficiency. And it's a remarkable thing about it or may be not so remarkable is that in that environment, why a cheaper instrument has remarkably little selling power to them. They are looking for ways of how they can substantially change the way they are doing R&D and when you talk to them about what ACQUITY UPLC or Synapt can do for them, that resonates as opposed to, I'll sell your five cheaper UPLCs.", "So it's absolutely clear that the level of customer who is taking that into account was looking at changing how they are doing things fundamental in their operations, whether its clinical... clinical trials, the front end of R&D or QA, QC. That degree of discussion on those accounts is noticeably higher today than it was say 5 or 6 years ago and I think that's what's driving things and the recognition that... UPLC, HPLC and mass spectrometry is at the heart of what these companies do. And I'm not talking about GC or spectrophotometers, it's just they have to focus with the heart of their R&D and development activities are and are frankly I think, we offer the breadth in those technologies with consumables, with the instruments, with the data, with the information services that it's hard for others to compete with us. So, it doesn't surprise me that they are turning to us for this and I think you are seeing it in the kind of business that we are driving through these accounts.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay. And on ACQUITY, I think it's been about a year and half since you opened it up to competitive systems in terms of integrating it. What's been kind of the net effect looking back there, I mean, have people been putting in ACQUITY on a thermal and ABI system or ...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, unquestionably, our penetration as a UPLC in the mass spectrometry systems is unqualifiedly successful in that area. So, its not just a grudging position, I would say its almost a universal position that ACQUITY UPLC has, if not the leading position what I would quite easily forecast to be the leading position at the front end of competitive mass specs in the not too distant future.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay. And then finally just on Synapt, can you give us a sense of where we are in the adoption cycle right now, both maybe in terms of customer base, are we rapidly moving beyond the earlier adopters here and then are there new application areas that are merging that weren't obvious 6 months ago?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say the... it's still early in the curve, but the growth rate is very high. I would say the current purchases in these systems are still heavily weighted into the protein structure marketplace. We are seeing a great deal of interest in metabolite ID and other areas, but early on let's say its the high end academic research centers that are very interested in the technology, but I'd say the amount of enthusiasm and quote level that we have out on Synapt are and across these applications is very, very high.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "John Sullivan of Leerink Swann; your line is open.", "John L. Sullivan - Leerink Swann & Company", "Hey guys, good morning. Just a couple of very quick ones... and congratulations. The... can we just talk about the pharma; the global pharma customer group for one more second? You've had very good success for a few quarters in a row now with this customer group, with success in driving business. Does it change the way you think about the fourth quarter potential for these customers and specifically, these customers' traditional buying pattern where a lot of the business comes through in the fourth quarter? How does the first three quarters' strength change the way if at all, that you look at the fourth quarter potential of these customers?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'd say, discreetly we think that our opportunity in the fourth quarter is good with large pharma. As I said, that's two things; it's the level of understanding and quote activity and looking at the specific programs that we have going on with the 15 or 20 largest accounts. It's the fact that the only... I mean it's the really largest pharmaceutical account that are the most troubling right now, and we understand that particular account pretty well and we think we understand what's likely to come in the near-term and that's better than what we've seen in the past quarter.", "In effect that... just the magic of how quarterly business fell last year, the challenge in the fourth quarter for those large accounts is not nearly as high as it was in the quarter that we just passed. So, that's not necessarily a statement about the next two or three years, but in the near-term it doesn't cause us a great deal of concern.", "John L. Sullivan - Leerink Swann & Company", "Great, I appreciate that. And then lastly, you talk about Synapt and a particular application you outlined was high sensitivity impurity profiling. Is that in the manufacturing processing, is it in biopharmaceuticals or in pills as well and is it actually occurring in the manufacturing process or is it occurring in drug development?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Its principally today in existing biopharmaceutical manufacture, John. I'd say is where the great deal of interest is amongst the people who are trying to characterize their biopharmaceuticals and as you know that analytical challenge is pretty significant and I think we now see the Synapt as a tool that better than anything else is in the ability, both the ability to characterize things that they couldn't see before as well as having to do with it to avoid risk. And so that's what we're talking about in terms of impurity identification, and that's essentially with people who are in the market today.", "John L. Sullivan - Leerink Swann & Company", "That's very helpful. Thanks and congrats again.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Quintin Lai of Robert W. Baird; your line is open. Mr. Quintin Lai, your line is open.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "Hi thanks for taking the follow up. With respect to tax rate, you said that there was a true up to get it to 16.2%, but then in the fourth quarter now you're saying 15.9%. So I guess why isn't fourth quarter just a 16.2 and then that kind of going forward John, do you think that 16% is kind of a good rate?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", ".", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "What an excellent question because that's the question that the CEO has asked 3 times in the wrap up of this quarter.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Welcome to the world of FIN 48, unfortunately. When you... within the quarter we had a couple of adjustments associated with estimates of liabilities for the U.S. return in the mass tax return from '06, the combination of which resulted in the fact that we had to true up those estimates all within the third quarter, nothing gets smoothed across the entire year's rate. So those couple of amounts, when you include them in kind of the run rate pro forma of tax rate comes to 16.2% for the full year, but on a run rate basis, when you exclude those couple of items, you're back down to 15.9%, which would be kind of a starting point for looking at what the tax rate might be going forward. So again it's taking that full impact all within the third quarter and not smoothing it across the full year rates.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Quintin, the way I think is easiest way to understand it is it's almost $1 million of tax provision in the third quarter, its kind of a one-time item that unfortunately the tax laws require. The accountants require you to put that through your provision all in the third quarter and then it goes away in the fourth quarter. So, confusing, but that's the way require to do it.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "Well, thank you very much for the clarity. I much appreciate it.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "There are no further questions.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, thank you all for participating and we'll all look forward to meeting again after the fourth quarter.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter and full year financial results conference call.", "With me on today's call is John Ornell, Waters Chief Financial Officer; and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "As is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the business highlights. And then John will follow with details on our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2008. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the Company, this time for Q1 and full year 2008. I caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual event or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 in part one under the caption Business Risk Factors.", "We further caution you that the Company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2008.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached in the Company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of restructuring, purchased intangible, and retired transition charges.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. Well, our fourth quarter results reflect strong operating income performance and allowed us to achieve significant sales and earnings growth for the full year, and it was accompanied by very strong cash generation. However, our earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter did not materialized quite as we had anticipated as an unexpected increase in our annual tax rate among other factors adversely affected our bottom line performance. John will walk you through the details and quantify the factors that resulted in this adjustment.", "Now, I will review for you some of the significant trends that we saw in the fourth quarter and how set the stage for our outlook for 2008. In the quarter, we principally saw our continuation of the trends that drove our growth through the first nine months of the year. These trends included improved pharmaceutical spending, the continued expansion of our businesses in the developing world, rapid uptake of our ACQUITY UPLC, and our new MS system, and very impressive results for the TA Instruments division. Our sales growth was in line with our October outlook. However, foreign currency translation was a larger factor than we expected. In addition, our sales in Japan were weaker than anticipated due to a combination of a sluggish economic condition and a change in the testing protocols for drinking water analysis in Japan. In our opinion, however, we have maintained or even marginally expanded our market share position in Japan through this tough period.", "Looking at customer segments for the largest division, growth in our overall pharmaceutical sector was again driven by generic, CRO and smaller specialty firms. Sales to our largest accounts showed mixed results, with a minority of firms depressing the sales growth for the group as a whole. Overall, the year-end budget flush was a little less dramatic than we had hoped, but certainly not too different than what we had expected, based on their spending patterns throughout the year. On the positive side, we saw a nice increase in ACQUITY UPLC uptake, with a number of multi-system orders placed by these large firms.", "Regionally, our business in North America continued to perform well, and we saw nice increases in our industrial markets including food and environmental testing along with strong governmental and university spending. Pharmaceutical demand in the US was stronger than in other developed economies as our improved sales to CROs and generic drug manufacturers and to most of our large accounts, allowed us to grow our overall pharma revenues despite weakness from a few large players. Pharmaceutical spending was less robust in Europe where a combination of a difficult quarterly comparison and weaker sales to large multinational firms resulted in a slight year-over-year decline. Overall, and before currency effects, our business in Europe saw a modest growth in the quarter with food testing applications, continuing to be a positive contributor.", "Outside of Japan, our business in Asia continued to benefit from strong double-digit sales growth rates in China, India and other developing Asian markets.", "We turn now to our major product lines. Instrumentation systems growth in the Waters division continues to be driven by the uptake of ACQUITY UPLC and ACQUITY LCMS systems. Customer feedback on the performance, reliability and broad applicability of ACQUITY UPLC continues to be very favorable. And the advantages of combining UPLC technology with mass spec characterization appear well-established in the marketplace. In the quarter, we saw particular interest in ACQUITY from metabolic profiling studies. This application truly benefits from the enhanced speed and resolution that\u2019s only available by using UPLC technology.", "In addition, the number of multi-system ACQUITY system orders was increasing throughout the quarter as more customers were more fully outfitting entire labs with the technology. Mass spectrometry and related systems sales growth in the quarter was led by strong demand for our high resolution SYNAPT HDMS and our new TQD Tandem Quadrupole instruments. Demand for MS-based systems was strongest in North America and Asia driven by sales to CROs, proteomics labs and for industrial chemical applications.", "SYNAPT HDMS technology has quickly established a firm share in the high resolution mass spectrometry segment. In applications from protein structural studies to metabolized profiling to batch testing of final pharmaceuticals, SYNAPT HDMS is allowing scientists to glean new information and accelerate research studies.", "In October, I mentioned that HDMS was driving a revolution in mass spectrometry. The demand and interest that we saw in the fourth quarter is consistent with that view and we are optimistic about our growth prospects for this technology in 2008.", "Looking at our recurring revenue from chemical products and services, in the fourth quarter, we again saw sales at a double-digit rate as we continued to benefit from the strong uptick of the ACQUITY columns by our expanding base of ACQUITY UPLC customers.", "TA Instruments finished the year with yet another strong double-digit sales growth quarter. With TA, the growth was geographically balanced with exceptional product line growth from the division\u2019s new Q Series thermal analysis line. From a market segment view, business was strong from electronics manufacturers and from life sciences researches microcalorimetry techniques.", "Before passing on to John, I\u2019d like to comment on our overall performance in 2007. The year stands out as one of Waters\u2019 strongest in terms of sales growth and successful implementations of strategic system-based initiatives. We began the year with a more conservative outlook for revenue growth as there were concerns regarding the health of our pharmaceutical accounts, and we recognized that quarterly comparisons with 2006 will become more difficult as we moved into the second half of 2007. However, as we reported our results through the first three quarters of the year, we became increasingly confident that the success of our new products, along with the health of our key markets could allow us to exceed our initial projections, all suggesting that 2007 would be another double-digit sales growth year for Waters.", "Coming into the fourth quarter, we were very optimistic about our prospects for ACQUITY, SYNAPT, and our TA Instruments Group. In fact, our assumptions were correct, as each of these business groups grew an excessive 20%. Despite these successes our fourth quarter projections came up a little short as weaker than expected businesses in Japan and to a lesser extent Europe resulted in organic sales growth about 2 points lower than we had anticipated. I think it\u2019s worth mentioning, however, that the fourth quarter of 2007 was by far the strongest sales quarter in Waters history and complete the year of strong double digit sales in our earnings growth for the Company. But more than looking at only the financial results, 2007 was a year that Waters continued to transform the analytical industry by establishing ACQUITY UPLC as a mainstream separation technology with applications across all market segments and successful installations all over the world.", "In 2007, we also established a new market segment in research mass spectrometry HDMS or High Definition Mass Spectrometry. This advanced instrument has brought a new dimension into the field of mass spec. The ability to analyze and identify based upon molecular shape. We are confident that HDMS will continue to expand the application reach of mass spectrometry.", "ACQUITY UPLC and SYNAPT HDMS are examples of the future system solution that Waters will develop and commercialize in 2008 and beyond. Our goal is to offer our customers technologically advanced solutions to their most difficult scientific problems. Solutions that seamlessly and creatively integrate the technologies that our customers associate with Waters and TA Instruments. Based on the combination of our strong product position, the continued expansion of our sales into the developing world, and the sustainability of demands for our more established markets, we anticipate double digit topline growth in 2008 and the ability to leverage this group to higher earnings per share and stronger free cash flow.", "Our commitments to continuously reduce the manufacturing cost of ACQUITY drive consumable sales and actively transfer a more production to lower cost site will allow us to improve our trade margins. At the same time, conservative expansion of SG&A in R&D expenses will help improve our overall profitability.", "Our free cash flow in 2007 is $327 million, and that was an increase of more than 35% over 2006. Generating this level of cash provides us with a flexibility to continuously seek opportunities to invest in our business and is indicative of the fundamental strength of the Waters franchise. In 2008, we plant to deploy this cash on our share buyback program, while continuing to look for acquisition opportunities that are synergistic with our business operations.", "In closing, I would like to assure you that I am confident that 2008 will be a successful year for Waters. We are well positioned to benefit from a series of exciting new products that appeal to large segments of the markets that we serve. And as we start the year, it appears to us that most of the underlying business conditions that allowed us to perform well in 2007 remain intact. We will continue to do what we are best at doing, offering our customers technically differentiated systems offerings, and a strong portfolio of consumable products and services. At the same time, we will work toward offering our shareholders an investment that offers superior sales growth, industry leading profitability, and strong free cash flow.", "Thank you and here\u2019s John with a more detailed financial update.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Doug and good morning.", "Fourth quarter results delivered 13% sales growth and 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. Earnings per share were $0.98 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.84 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.96 this quarter compared to $0.78 last year, a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Sales grew by 13% this quarter with currency providing 5 percentage points of growth and acquisitions providing about 1 percentage point. Looking at corporate sales growth regionally and before foreign change effects, our results were positive in most of our major geographies, with continuation of trends that we have seen at the end of September. Sales in the U.S. continued their double digit growth and this quarter were up 12%. Sales within Europe were a bit slower in the fourth quarter and were up 5% before it covers the effects. Sales in Japan were softer than expected and were down by 12% in Q4. However, outside of Japan, Asian sales remained strong and grew by 18%.", "Turning to the product front, within the Waters Division, Instrument Systems grew by 3% versus a difficult base of comparison. Our service business grew by 7% and chemistry had 20% growth, which was aided by acquisitions and growth of ACQUITY after market column sales. Without acquisitions, our chemistry business grew by 11%.", "And our TA Instruments division had another strong quarter with sales up 19% versus prior year resulting from strong new product sales. M&A activity contributed 2% to this result as well.", "Now I would like to comment on non-GAAP margins and expenses, excluding adjustments noted in this morning\u2019s press release. Gross margin came in a little lower than expected at 58.4% this quarter. Versus prior year, margins expanded this quarter, and were up by 40 basis points. Versus our expectations however, margins were lower than our October forecast due largely to less favorable manufacturing variances resulting from lower than anticipated instrument production. SG&A and R&D expenses grew by 7% this quarter compare to prior year.", "Our operational tax rate this quarter was 20.7% bringing our full year operational rate to 18%. This rate was well above our expectation and is largely a result of a couple of factors. First, during the quarter, our production levels at our tax favored Ireland and Singapore manufacturing facilities were lower than expected for select instrument systems due to shifts in customer demand and inventory reductions. At the same time, production volumes at our UK, US manufacturing sites were in aggregate over plan as ACQUITY, SYNAPT, and TA Instrument product sales were strong. These variances in manufacturing volume resulted in an additional tax expense of about $2 million. And secondly, at the end of each year, during our closing process, we review our legal entity results and make necessary adjustments to our inter-company pricing to comply with our transfer pricing policies. These adjustments are the result of variances in expected volumes, within sales subsidiaries, actual versus estimated legal entity costs, and adjustments to estimated charges for support services, all of which impacted profitability at many of our 40 legal entities.", "Historically, each year-end adjustments have netted a smaller amounts and were generally offset by favorable production volumes in Ireland and Singapore. This year, however, these adjustments resulted in an additional tax expense of about $3 million. We understand the issues which gave rise to this additional tax expense and are implementing changes to our internal processes to address them.", "On the stock buyback front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market, and during the fourth quarter, we purchased 250,000 of common stock for $19.9 million. Fully diluted share count was 102.8 million shares for the quarter, up 1 million shares from Q3. This increase is the result of higher option exercises than expected this quarter and the impact of a much higher share price than under the treasury stock method of accounting for diluted shares, increased share count and reduced our earnings this quarter by about $0.01 versus our October expectations.", "On the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $693 million, bringing us to a net debt position of about $191 million. We are well positioned to fund our future working capital needs and acquisition opportunities. We measure free cash flow as cash from operations plus capital expenditures plus any non-cash tax benefits from FAS 123R accounting. For the quarter, free cash flow was $86 million after funding $15 million of CapEx. Comparable free cash flow in Q4 last year was $54 million. Full year free cash flow is $327 million after funding $60 million of CapEx and adding back $17 million of FAS 123R tax benefit. 2006 comparable free cash flow, without unusual payments was $242 million.", "Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 66 days this quarter, up 2 days versus Q4 last year with currency effects comprising one day of the increase year-over-year. Inventories decreased $15 million this quarter and ended the year up a modest $7.5 million, largely attributable to currency translation.", "Turning now to full year 2007 performance. Sales grew by 15% versus last year, with currency adding 3% to sales growth and M&A adding about 1%. Gross margins declined by 80 basis points as a result of higher volumes of newly introduced products in our sales mix and foreign currency effects. SG&A grew by 9% and R&D was up only modestly, in spite of headcount additions made this year, due to a strong base of comparison in 2006, where large material costs for new products raised expenses that year. Operating margin as a percentage of sales was up 100 basis points and earnings per fully diluted share for the full year grew by 20%.", "Now, I would like to turn to our outlook for 2008. We believe our business fundamentals remain solid, but most end market and geographies and to our strong customer interest in our new products and technologies. Given this backdrop, we believe that a reasonable expectation for sales growth in 2008, would be somewhere in the range of 8% to 10% for organic sales growth for the full year. Currency at today\u2019s levels would add about 2% to growth next year, bringing our overall growth rate to 10% to 12%.", "Moving down to P&L. We expect gross margins to improve by about 20 basis points as a result of improved production efficiencies on higher volumes of ACQUITY products and a favorable mass spec sales mix that contains more high-end mass spec system sales next year.", "Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate slightly less than sales. As the year progresses, we will moderate our spending on additional resources to keep our expense growth aligned with actual sales volumes. We expect our tax rate to be about 18% for 2008. Of course, with the unexpected increase in our rate in 2007, we have taken a hard look at the factors that will influence our tax rate for 2008 and this reduced adjustment of rate of around 18% is sustainable, and we will continue to explore opportunities for movement of additional production volumes to our Singapore and Ireland.", "Net interest expense is expected to be in the neighborhood of $21 million. And our fully diluted outstanding share count is estimated to be about 103 million for the full year. Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be about $3.20, where sales growth is between 10% and 12% and within a tolerance of plus and minus 5%. For Q1, we expect sales growth of 13% which includes 3 points of currency impact this quarter. Currency effects are expected to be more favorable earlier in the year in 2008, given easier bases of comparison in the first half. While we expect gross margins to improve for the full year, in the first quarter, we expect lower gross margins as a result of strong foreign currency early this year. And our product costs reductions are not expected to have a favorable impact until later in the year.", "Operating expenses are expected to grow a bit less than sales, and operating margins should be about comparable to Q1 2007 and result in earnings per fully diluted share of $0.63 for the quarter, plus or minus 5%. Doug.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, John. I think, operator, now we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Quintin Lai, Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning. Turning to Japan, could you point out what percent of your sales are\u2026 come from Japan right now?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, about 10% of our overall sales are based in Japan.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "And then, with the forecast that you are putting in, what do you expecting for Japan in 2008?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Low single digit growth and that\u2019s based on anniversarying some of this issue, obviously, as we go through the second half of the year, probably a little bit more of a difficult comparison early on in the year. But for the full year, a few points of growth out of that region.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "And then with the rest of the outlook for 2008, what are you expecting for Europe in terms of big pharma?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We are pretty much expecting a continuation of current conditions in big pharma, which is a mix of some of those showing pretty good demand, some of them being slow. But pretty much, a year that\u2019s a continuation of large pharma dynamics that we are seeing at the end of \u201907.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Great. And then I will ask one more question, then I will back get in the queue. With respect to cash deployment, last year sounded like that your number one option was to do more M&A and then number two might have been share buyback. Any change in thought with current conditions now?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I get you, I think that first and foremost we would certainly like to continue the M&A opportunities, continue to address the smaller ones that exist. We continue to peruse what\u2019s available in the marketplace. We\u2019ve made a few smaller acquisitions over the last few years that I think are still somewhat indicative of what we might be likely to do as we move forward.", "To the extent that we can\u2019t deploy cash there, then we will continue to deploy cash on the buyback effort, and we are budgeted to do that as we look at the cash we are going to generate in 2008.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I\u2019d answer it by saying we were reasonably aggressive buyers of our stock at its peak. To the extent that our stock were below its peak, we would be more aggressive buyers of our stock.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "I guess, just for a point of clarification then, the guidance of a 103 million shares for 2008 does not assume significant share buyback?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. It assumes about $200 million is deployed on buyback and it also assumes that the option exercises continue so that the net of those two is about a neutral situation. These are existing options that are in the market that we\u2019re anticipating will be exercised.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Right.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "So I think that\u2019s probably conservative but that\u2019s where we are starting.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Alright, thanks.", "Operator", "Tycho Peterson, J.P. Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Hi, good morning. Maybe just starting off a little bit with some of your comments around the gross margins. I mean, you talked about less favorable manufacturing variances and lower than anticipated instrument production overseas. Can you give a little color as to how you are thinking about the ramp in Singapore and Ireland? I mean is there a chance you could get more aggressive over the course of the year or do you have to kind of maintain the timelines that you\u2019ve previously laid out?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I would say that as we look at margins, we certainly do expect higher volumes of our SYNAPT product, as we continue through the year that will be favorable versus our prior year. We are looking at improving our costs on our ACQUITY products. We have some engineering cost reductions that we are working on that will improve the margins on that product by a few percentage points or more, as we go across the year. We are looking at moving additional production, a couple of detectors to our Singapore facility, really kind of mid-year. So there will be, I think, a significant increase in volume through that Singapore operation. All of that then will be offset by what we think will be a significant growth in ACQUITY that will put a little bit of downward pressure on all of these other factors that I\u2019m describing. So, I think, in total, as we look at that we feel comfortable that for the full year, kind of that 20-basis point improvement that we target year-over-year, would appear to be conservative given our plan.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "And I guess, along the same lines, in terms of the tax rate, is there an opportunity for some additional leverage there? I mean I know you laid out what your specifications are for the year, but given the same comments in terms of the offshore ramp.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I would say, certainly Singapore is expected to provide some downside pressure on the rate. However as we look at the volume coming out of the UK, the SYNAPT product is going to offset that to some extent. I think as we look to the future though, and as we look beyond movement of just these couple of detectors and the continued success of the facility that we have in Singapore, yes, there is more opportunities to move volume over multiple years and enjoy a tax rate there that perhaps will bring our overall rate down slightly in the future. I would just say for right now I am going to be a little, I think, cautious and suggest that starting at 18% starting point is probably prudent.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then finally on Japan, I appreciate you kind of quantifying the size of that business, can you give us a sense as to whether you are seeing anything different competitively, specifically from Sysmex in that market and whether you are seeing any changes just in terms of the level of competition.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I\u2019d say just the opposite, Tycho. I believe in all of our core applications, we\u2019re probably seeing, on balance, a little bit less competitive in a case by case example. ACQUITY has done very, very well in Japan. And there is really no practical competitor for it. So I do believe that this is\u2026 now in any one quarter something can, can blip, but in broad terms, I am pretty satisfied that we are more than holding our own in the Japanese market. The pharmaceutical market in Japan is probably the other thing that is much weaker even than it is in other areas of the world. So I think that\u2019s the dynamic that we\u2019re also seeing play out in Japan a little bit more than another area.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ross Muken, Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, gentlemen. Can you talk a bit about sort of the trends you are seeing in mass spec. It\u2019s obvious, given your commentary that SYNAPT continues to sort of gain transaction. I assume that\u2019s sort of relative to market share gain versus the entire market sort of growing at that rate. Can you talk a bit about sort of that dynamic and where you are seeing most of the placement in terms of the end customer mix, and then talk about sort of on the lower end pricing trends in sort of the LCMS business, business?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I think in SYNAPT, we are seeing it pretty much where we expected in proteomics, in metabolized profiling application. We are seeing it in biopharma\u2026 kind of interestingly enough in biopharma, almost QC applications. In terms of these complicated biopharmaceutical products being better characterized upon release with the capabilities of SYNAPT. So, and that\u2019s a relatively new application for us, I would say. So SYNAPT is very encouraging in kind of the spread although it is essentially large molecules.", "On the low end, our results were softer than we expected particularly in the, that core benchtop single quadrupole that has traditionally been a pharmaceutical marketplace for us. So, as pharmaceutical sales are tougher, that has had an impact on that single quadrupole marketplace. We have done very well as John noted with our new TQD benchtop triple quad instrument. As you know that aimed at more in the applied markets as opposed to that workhorse [ph] drug metabolism laboratory, where with a higher end triple quad is an area where we still don\u2019t have the market share that we hoped to have someday.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And, relative to the CRO market which continues to be strong for you, how should we think about that sort of going forward relative to the amount of outsourcing being done in pharma? I mean in some quarters, could we see increased weakness or is it sort of a longer term trend to see maybe pharma R&D growth be a bit lower because so much of it\u2019s being outsourced to the CROs and we're seeing the growth there. So, we should think about that sort of on a cumulative basis or are we not sort of at the point yet where we see that significant migration out of the sort of internal pharma R&D labs?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No. I think it\u2019s an excellent point, Ross. We're clearly seeing some of it and I think you're seeing\u2026 the impact of direct outsourcing, so, where a large pharma is contracting to have the CRO do work that he used to do in-house, you're seeing much\u2026 as drug come off patent clearly, you're seeing work that was going on in an ethical pharmaceutical house, and all that business going to a generic and that generic could be in the U.S. or it could be in India. I think, what we're clearly seeing is CROs being more aggressive about adopting new technology. And it\u2019s not totally clear to us whether that\u2019s just a new development in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s a new attitude, a new drive for efficiency. It perhaps signals a subtle degree of independence on the part of the CROs, where they\u2019re driving more into that efficiency area and sponsor pharmas are perhaps given a little bit of a control there.", "So it definitely does kind of impact you when you say what\u2019s big pharma doing versus what\u2019s specialty pharmas or CROs, because the work being done is probably exactly the same work. And it may even being done for the same companies just down on a contract basis.", "I think, overall, the dynamic works in our favor because there are more CROs implementing new labs. So they\u2019re not just driving more business into an existing instrument base. We\u2019re clearly seeing that in Eastern Europe, in places like Poland and Czechoslovakia and in India that, where the generic and the CRO base is growing phenomenally fast.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And quickly, lastly, on ACQUITY, obviously the uptake there continues to be strong. Were you surprised by the sort of multi-instrument placements you were getting in sort of single sites? It seemed like you sort of highlighted that in the commentary, and I didn\u2019t know if this was a distinct change. I thought we were seeing some of that before, but maybe the degree to which we were seeing that this quarter I guess was maybe more evident than it was previously.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it\u2019s notable\u2026 particularly in light of kind of continuing weakness in some big traditional pharmaceutical accounts. So in spite of that, we\u2019re seeing ACQUITY make more progress, and we like to kind of continue to watch this progress in the more of the QC applications, where we\u2019ll clearly get into the QC applications later, than the very strong uptake in the R&D and front-end applications. But we think we\u2019re really beginning to see that. That of course has been influenced by tough conditions in big pharma with these big labs where they\u2019ve been under very tough spending controls.  So one, is clearly being affected by the overall conditions. But in spite of that we\u2019re seeing these multiple orders for ACQUITY and I think that\u2019s a very good long-term sign.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Derik  deBruin, UBS.", "Derik  deBruin - UBS", "Hi, good morning.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Eric.", "Derik  deBruin - UBS", "When you look at the Japanese market, I guess, could you just talk about a little more about, you saw some shift in the drinking water regulations. I know nothing about that overall end market. I just was wondering if you could give me a little bit of a background on it.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Japan, specifically on the drinking water applications, Japan had very strong regulations concerning the number of samples. It began, probably in earnest about three years ago. And they continued to expand the analytical requirements and they continued to expand the number of samples that had to be run. So, labs had to keep adding capacity, not only in our gear but in a lot of analytical technologies in order to meet those requirements.", "And what happened last year is that the Japanese government substantially reduced the sampling requirements. And as a result, we saw a reduction in our business. We had a leading share in this marketplace, and we saw a reduction in both the consumable side of the business because of the samples as well as the instruments that were required to run it. I got to, I guess, take a little bit of the blame here. We probably should have seen this a little earlier, we knew that the slope wasn\u2019t going to be as strong forever in these applications. But the downturn came much faster than we anticipated. So, the slope in the fourth quarter was a pretty significant one, and that\u2019s what caught us by a little bit of a surprise.", "Derik  deBruin - UBS", "Fair enough. When you look at your 2008 guidance, when you still think that\u2026 to put it in terms of instrument consumables and services\u2026 I guess when you look at the chemistries that are there... you still see that market\u2026 you see the chemistry business growing ten-ish percent or a little bit higher than that and how do you see instruments growing?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. We think that our chemistry will continue to be strong. We think that the ramp that we\u2019ve seen in the ACQUITY columns over the last couple of years that\u2019s been very, very steep, will begin to impact growth, as we look at 2008. So, thinking of chemistry as a double-digit business, I don\u2019t think is the least bit aggressive based on the trends and the history that we see there.", "On the service front, I think we are still looking at high single-digit growth, for the services, for the corporation and then instruments are going to modulate, depending on whether organic growth is going to be 8% or 10%. So we are looking for high single-digit growth out of the instrument business, obviously led by ACQUITY and the SYNAPT mass spec. And we have got some new offerings, likewise coming this year at both PECON [ph] and ASMS, that we think will aid that instrument growth too as we move through the back end of the year.", "Derik  deBruin - UBS", "Great, that\u2019s helpful. When you look at the gross margin number, about 20 basis points increase year-over-year, I guess, how much is FX being a headwind on your gross margin number and I guess, can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of what is going to be your forecast in that?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I mean FX, if you look across the year, obviously we end the year at about the rates are at today. We begin the year with FX being more of an impact if you will. So I would say early in the process you are more likely to see FX be a depressant of our overall margins by maybe 20 basis points, 30 basis points, and by the end of the year becoming closer to neutral. So, I think overall, we are looking at a slight impact of FX, should rates stay above where they are today.", "Derik  deBruin - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "John Groberg, Merrill Lynch.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Congratulations on an overall great 2007. Just on the Japan number you gave, John, you said minus 12%. Was that excluding currency or including? Somebody said excluding, and somebody didn\u2019t clarify.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "That was excluding currency. That was before currency impact.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so that was\u2026", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, the Yen was not nearly as variable as the Euro and some other currencies. So I think the Yen, on average for the quarter 1.12, something like that, 1.11.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And then, if you look at that and Japan, I mean, would you categorize that minus 12% almost entirely due to this reduced number of required tests for water quality or are there other things going on in Japan?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The most significant effect was the water testing. We saw a little bit of a fall off in the food testing business also. So, the regulated applications for food testing and water testing are probably the two most significant factors.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It was down 8% at actual currency rates, John.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then you mentioned\u2026 maybe to follow on that\u2026 a number of times in your call you mentioned most drivers remain intact. And that most end markets and geographies remained stable. I mean, excluding Japan, and maybe we\u2019ve talked about, what else are you seeing out there that made you say, most, as opposed to a little bit more bullish commentary a quarter or two ago?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure\u2026", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And what specifically\u2026 sorry\u2026 and what specifically\u2026 it\u2019s probably questionable, people will question that the markets that you saw in the fourth quarter of \u201907, given what we\u2019re seeing happened, kind of in the macro environment will stay as they are. So if maybe you can just address that as well.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. That\u2019s a fair question. You remember, at this time last year, probably the single biggest question that we had was how is the US going to be, because the US is clearly our largest territory, and we have had like one quarter of decent performance in the US coming out of \u201906. The very clear story for us in \u201907 was good strong double-digit growth in the United States. And partly in the US, it\u2019s the fact that they\u2019ve been under pressure in the large accounts, and we have looked to expand our business outside of those key large pharma accounts that we owned for so many years. But as we came under pressure there, we certainly have done a better job at expanding our business in smaller accounts. And we have seen that keep up throughout 2008.", "We\u2019ve also continued\u2026 I think in the US, we have seen this very clearly, these systems are very clear, high productivity systems. So even in challenging economic times, we are finding in many accounts the ability to make a very strong case for investing in these high productivity systems. And that seems to be playing itself out in the US very well. If you look at our high growth areas of Asia, India, China, Korea, Taiwan, those very high double digit growth rates, we have seen no slackening of the interest, and the early demand signs from those territories as we go into 2008. As a matter of fact, in some cases we are even seeing stronger signs of growth. So, our traditional of the last couple of years, high end growth vectors are, we believe, continuing into \u201908.", "Japan, we think the fourth quarter was a little bit of an anomaly, not a total anomaly, but the slope is not going to be as severe as we go into 2008. So you\u2026 and then, so Western Europe is the other large territory, geography. We saw a little bit of slow down versus our expectations in Europe in the fourth quarter, but it wasn\u2019t huge. So we are looking at Europe carefully. Europe is a whole bunch of little markets rather than kind of one big one. And we are, we have leavened our expectations, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatically different from what we have seen in the fourth quarter. So, you add to that a healthy dollop of new products coming in and the ramp up on things like ACQUITY and SYNAPT continue to be very strong. So that leads you to an \u201908 that\u2019s kind of as John outlined it. It\u2019s probably\u2026 it\u2019s a little bit conservative versus what we saw on average in \u201907. But the key geographies and the key customer sets are not all that different.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And just as a point of clarification, ending \u201907 what was your mix of say life science and all the CROs, pharma, all those clients and more industrial or applied markets, and if you are kind of broadening out there?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "If you look at the overall, we talked about our overall mix of life science sales versus industrial\u2026 John, you have it right at your fingertips.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. We look at about 70% of our business in that range being broadly defined life sciences, with about 50% of that being university, government, the rest being for-profit and then 30% being really defined other. I mean there is a lot of different categories in there, as you know, that\u2019s food and beverage, that\u2019s environmental, that\u2019s the pure chemical industries, the Dow, the DuPont. So there is a pretty diverse set of customers in that other 30%.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And academic and government is 15\u2026 1-5?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, 15%. And that is worldwide, so there is not quite as much exposure there to the US, as you may think.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And what would that have looked like into \u201806 if you have that number, just to see if there was kind of a broadening out.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, about the same, because as you know our businesses, the TA have done very, very well. A lot of the life sciences businesses have done well. A lot of the food safety applications have also done very well, so that, on average we really haven\u2019t seen a dramatic shift in that proportion of our business over the last couple of years.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "The biggest dynamic would obviously be large pharma that has been a little bit of an anchor to our performance. But that\u2019s been offset, as we\u2019ve talked about by improvements in the generic CRO and Biotech areas.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then last question, you also made a comment that the budget flush this, in the fourth quarter was maybe a little less than hoped for and maybe not so far out of your expectations, but then hoped for in this. And just, maybe, have you talked to people in the field and got a census to maybe why that was the case?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I would say we saw probably as much as we had expected in the US, it was probably a little bit softer in Europe. And I think in general, we have seen big pharma in Europe be a little more problematical than big pharma in the US. Now you know that a lot of those accounts have the same names in Western Europe as in US. But we do, I think, see where the traditional European pharmas are perhaps outsourcing into Eastern Europe and into India a little faster than the traditional American big pharmas. So, I think that\u2019s one of the things that we keep monitoring, as we look at our European business. We have seen some very clear anecdotes of that. I don\u2019t have any absolutely rolled up numbers to prove that but, that\u2019s what I think has happened a little bit more in Europe, as we got into the end of the year.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "John Sullivan, Leerink Swann.", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Good morning.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, John. How are you?", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "A couple of quick ones here. John, when you were talking earlier about ACQUITY margins, having a chance to grow by a few hundred basis points over 2008, is that instrument manufacturing improvement alone or does that also include perhaps some benefit of mix shift away from instruments and toward columns?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "No. I\u2018m talking about truly engineering reductions of cost with those products along with higher volumes alone for a bit more favorable production variances and purchasing leverage as well on all of that. I think we're just that alone, we're talking about being able to improve margins by 3% or so as we go across the year.", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Okay, great. And then relatedly, to the ACQUITY related columns carry higher margins than the instrument itself at this stage of the game?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Higher, yes. But they\u2019ll be comparable to the margins that we get on HPLC columns. So the margins as we've said are definitely higher than the instrument margins and comparable to HPLC.", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And then lastly, what portion of the company\u2019s revenues are coming from recurring sources today?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Little over 40% that come from recurring sources. 40% to 45%.", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Thanks very much.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Derik De Bruin, UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Hi. Just a couple of follow-ups.  So, what\u2026 when you look at 2008, what\u2019s your depreciation and amortization and CapEx reduction?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "The CapEx would be comparable to this year, so a number of around the $60 million range. And I don\u2019t have the depreciation and amortization with me, but it would be, it\u2019d probably be about 5% to 8% higher than this year approximately.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And you did say during\u2026 you don\u2019t break out the specific product lines anymore, but you did say that there was growth of 20% in most of the major product lines. Is that\u2026 did I catch you correctly on that one?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No. We were specifically talking about ACQUITY\u2026", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "\u2026SYNAPT and TA instruments.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "\u2026Being the things that we had focused on in recent communications.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay.", "John A. Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "\u2026 And they in fact continued with their momentum in the fourth quarter.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "That\u2019s double-digit growth in the other two lines, the other three lines?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Quintin Lai, Robert W. Baird", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. I think that one of the general concerns, I think that is going to come out of this report is your exposure to cyclical markets. So, can you kind of just review for us in terms what do you view as some of your products that might be historically exposed to cyclical markets? And then as a follow up to that, talking about TA which has been putting out some really good numbers, your expectations for the TA business?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I mean I suppose it\u2019s all in how you define a cyclical market. For years and years the pharmaceutical industry wasn\u2019t cyclical. And now depending on how you define it, it\u2019s cycling in a different direction. We used to\u2026 in those days think of the industrial chemical market as being the most cyclical, with companies like Dow and DuPont, Shell Chemicals as being the ones that would have three years on and two years off. I think you really have to look underneath those broad terms of what these customers are to think about cyclicality. I still think if you look broadly at the pharmaceutical marketplace that we are talking about, including generics and CROs and bio-pharm, we still look at industries that are investing and going to continue to try to find new products to improve their bottom line and improve health. It may be business that\u2019s done more in China and India, one quarter than is done in Europe or the United states. But overall you are still looking at growth applications. And we certainly saw that in 2006 and we saw it in 2007.", "So, I don\u2019t think overall if you look at that 70% of our business, that it is not growth. It still is, but it is moving around and moving around different accounts, different applications, different customers. So, I think overall there is still no reason to believe that the sum total of that, given the developing countries, the developed countries and the regulatory spending that that doesn\u2019t support what I would call a growth industry.", "I also think in these applied markets, the food safety, water testing, overall, more of that\u2019s going to be done tomorrow than it\u2019s done today. More of it is going to get done in the U.S., more of it is going to be done in the exporting countries. So, in any individual quarter, maybe you have a blip. We honestly had one in Japan, but overall those environmental and regulatory applications are high growth areas. So I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think we are in cyclical business. I think it\u2019s sometimes tough to call from quarter to quarter. But overall, it\u2019s not all that variable; it continues to exhibit a pretty good underlying fundamental increases in demand.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "And on the TA front you had asked growth there, we are expecting about 8% organic growth out of TA and another couple of points of growth through the acquisition on the microcalorimetry front. And we see some pretty interesting opportunities still on that front of incorporating our products into the TA line. And TA has a new regulometer [ph] coming out next year too that looks pretty exciting. So I think their new product pipeline continues to be strong. So it wouldn\u2019t surprise me that you saw a continued double digit top line for TA Instruments as we look at 2008.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Great. Thank you for taking my follow up. It\u2019s tough that right off the bat you are one of the first tools companies to go off and so right now, a lot of people are going to be looking at your experience of what\u2019s going on in Japan for\u2026 is that something, just a blip or is that one quarter or is it something just overall market but from the sounds of it, it sounds like just a lot of that weakness was related to that water reg change. And then just going into the visibility for 2008, I guess you feel okay about the Japanese market getting more solid\u2026", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think we feel okay is probably the best term. We are not expecting it to become double digit. But we are not expecting the steep drop that we saw in our fourth quarter to continue.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "All right, thanks.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "And if you look at the base of comparison there, if you look at last year you saw mid-teens growth in that market. So it was a difficult base of comparison as well.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Tycho Peterson, J.P. Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson - J. P. Morgan", "Thanks for taking the follow up. Doug, following up in your comments from a moment ago about just some of these, these other markets that are more driven by regulation, food testing, environmental testing, things like that. Can you give us a sense as to whether there are any kind of regulatory developments that you are looking at or monitoring over that could impact the business one way or another over the next six months or so?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer", "Six months may be a little early, Tycho. I think we are going to see a bigger, longer term effect as in the US, particularly with food and safety testing. There is definitely a lot of discussions going on in Washington concerning the regulatory environment. There is definitely concern on the part of our Asian customers concerned with how are they going to have to change their procedures to satisfy what they perceive as likely incremental regulations coming out of Washington. So I feel pretty confident that that\u2019s likely to happen in the long term and spur investment on both sides of the ocean. But I don\u2019t sense that happening in the six month time frame.", "Tycho Peterson - J. P. Morgan", "Okay. And then from a portfolio standpoint and kind of the sales standpoint, you feel comfortable serving those markets with what you currently have or is there a need for further portfolio evolution to kind of cater to some of these emerging market opportunities.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we have got a very strong portfolio to serve them now. There is always some tweaking that\u2019s going on, kind of in the ease of use area. Because oftentimes, you are dealing with technicians, who are running the instruments and you need to concern with instruments that are very easy to use. But, in terms of the technical capabilities, I think we have all of the capabilities that are needed to serve that marketplace.", "Tycho Peterson - J. P. Morgan", "Okay. And then just finally, can you comment on the neonatal business, how that\u2019s been doing and your outlook there.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Neonatal business is part of our clinical operations. We are happy\u2026 as most of you know, we access the neonatal business through a partnership. And the neonatal business is still a good business. We tend to get boluses of orders. It tends to be a lumpy business on the instruments side. But if you look at it in full year terms, we think that application continues to be a growth opportunity for us. Inside the US, and as various states get up to speed, as well as major opportunities in places like Asia.", "Tycho Peterson - J. P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Alright operator. Well thank you all, we appreciate you taking the time this morning. And we plan to talk to you again in another quarter.

Sullivan, CFA - Leerink Swann & Company", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. And good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter financial results conference call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer.", "And as is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter's highlights and then John will follow with some details on our financial results and then provide you with the -- our outlook for the second quarter and then for the full year.", "But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, and for Q2 and full year 2008. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. For detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, read [ph] our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, Part I under the caption 'Business Risk Factors.' We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions.", "We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for July 2008. During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussion of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of purchased intangible amortization and retirement plan transition changes.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. Well, overall I've said, I am pleased with our financial results in the first quarter that has been for many companies one of the most difficult quarters in a number of years. With 12% revenue growth, 23% earnings per share growth, and over $100 million in free cash flow generated, I think it's hard to characterize our results as anything but very good.", "Examining the quarter's results a little more closely to better understand these results, our organic growth rate in the first quarter did come in lighter than we expected as we did see some delays in spending from many of our pharmaceutical accounts and continued weakness in our Japanese business. Qualitatively these trends were consistent with the market dynamics that we talked about in our January call. However, weaknesses in these segments were in fact a little more significant than we had envisioned, and accounted for the lion share of the variation in our organic sales results from our expectations.", "Looking at our pharmaceutical accounts, sales in Europe were less than our forecast, especially for high-end research instrument system. Discussions with both our customers and our management staff in Europe suggested much of the weaknesses associated with order delays, and that business momentum should improve throughout the year. Our market segments within Europe, outside of pharmaceutical performed in line with our expectations; both [ph] in Eastern Europe continues to be strong.", "In North America, sales to a handful of drug firms were also soft, and contributed to a flattish year-over-year performance. Yet too we expect that order rates will pick-up throughout the year.", "Pharmaceutical accounts outside of our top 15 to 20 accounts, including generics, CROs and biotech companies demonstrated good sales growth and allowed us to grow our overall pharmaceutical sales in the quarter. In addition, and as we have seen in the past few quarters, sales to the drug industry in Asia have been a significant driver for the entire pharmaceutical sector.", "Looking forward to the remainder of 2008, we're cautiously optimistic that our pharma business will improve. Already we have seen increased order activity in the opening weeks of the second quarter and some indications at some of our historically largest accounts, ones that have been particularly conservative during the past couple of years, maybe ready to accelerate their spending.", "Looking at instrument product lines within the Waters division, sales for most categories grew at similar rates during the quarter with research related systems seeing a little more softness than systems for more routine testing applications.", "Our business in Asia outside of Japan continued to be a strong double-digit growth trajectory. Pharmaceutical demand was strong in India and China as outsourcing from the developed world continues, and more large western firms expand their footprint in the region. We believe we will continue to see strong growth here for the rest of the year.", "In Japan we continue to weather a combination of soft market conditions and a difficult base quarter comparison. Though we expect economic conditions in Japan to remain at best uncertain, more favorable quarterly comparisons as we move through 2008 will help us offset market weakness.", "In the first quarter we grew our recurring revenues at a slower than typical rate. The issues already mentioned in Japan along with some logistical factors specific to the quarter account for most of the shortfall. However, we are very confident that the first quarter's result is somewhat of an aberration and that growth rates for our recurring revenues will rebound during the year.", "Looking at TA Instruments we are pleased with the first quarter's results. During the quarter, the division was able to grow its newly acquired microcalorimetry business while driving geographically balanced growth for its core thermal and rheology line.", "The first quarter's results do not yet reflect the positive impact of new research-grade rheometers that we plan to begin shipping later this quarter. We are expecting another strong year from TA Instruments this year.", "Moving down to P&L, it's clear to see operational improvements throughout the business. Our efforts to reduce manufacturing costs have improved our gross margins, while expense controls have allowed us to leverage our spending. We believe that we'll continue to see year-over-year improvements as we move through 2008.", "On the manufacturing front, we plan to increase production levels of chromatography instrumentation in Singapore this year, higher production volumes in Singapore will allow us to reduce manufacturing cost further, as well as providing additional tax benefits.", "John will be walking you through other P&L detail, I wanted to comment on our strong cash flow in the first quarter and reemphasize the priority we've placed on this important metric.", "During the quarter and before funding the transition from a defined benefit retirement plans to 401(k) plan, we generated a little over $100 million in free cash flow, which represents, by the way, 27% of sales. This level of cash generation is indicative of the operational efficiency of our business and provides us with significant flexibility to strengthen our business going forward. Throughout the first quarter we aggressively acted on our share repurchase program. And looking at our investment plans for 2008 you should expect us to continue to seek up acquisition opportunities slightly similar in size as we have completed over the past couple of years, and for us to deploy the balance of our cash flow to our share repurchase plan.", "Finally, looking at our EPS growth for the first quarter, I think it clearly shows that we demonstrated an ability to manage our operations and our balance sheet to maximize our returns. As we move through 2008, we plan to fully fund our key product development program, and expand our sales and support organizations in growth markets while closely managing our spending.", "In closing, I would like to note that we feel we have a very strong new product pipeline and are prepared and well-positioned to aggressively and profitably expand our market position.", "I would like to turn it over to John.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Doug.", "Our first quarter results delivered 12% sales growth and 23% growth in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. Earnings per share was $0.69 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.56 last year. On a GAAP basis our earnings were $0.67 this quarter compared to $0.54 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Sales grew by 12% this quarter with currency providing six percentage points of growth. Looking at corporate sales growth regionally and before foreign currency effects, sales within the U.S. and Europe were impacted by a sluggish start to the year at several of our top pharma accounts. Sales within US were up 9% this quarter and within Europe sales were down about 2% before currency effects. Sales within Japan remain soft and were down by 9% while sales in Asia outside of Japan remained strong and were up 27%.", "Turning to the product fronts within the Waters division, instrument systems grew by 5%, our service business grew by 7%, and chemistry had a 3% growth rate. At TI Instruments division had another strong quarter with sales up 12% versus prior year resulting from strong new product sales.", "Now I would like to comment on non-GAAP margins and expenses excluding items noted in this morning's press release. Gross margin came in better than expected at 58.2% this quarter versus prior year, margins expanded by about 150 basis points. This quarter we had the benefit of new product cost reductions, favorable product mix, and currency translation was favorable as well exhibiting a strengthening yen and euro combined with a relatively flat British pound.", "SG&A expenses grew by about 13% this quarter compared to prior year, and were heavily influenced by currency translation. R&D expenses grew by 6%.", "Company's effective tax rate this quarter was 18.6%, which is generally consistent with our initial expectations. This rate is slightly above our 2007 tax rate due to higher profits in our euro denominated entities, which will have higher profits this year at current exchange rates.", "On the stock buyback front, we continued to purchase our shares in the open-market and during the first quarter we purchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $75 million. Fully diluted share count was 102 million shares for the quarter.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $759 million, and debt totaled $929 million bringing us to a net debt position of about $170 million.", "In the quarter, we closed on a new additional committed term loan facility of $150 million, which provides us with additional access to capital and financial flexibility. We measure free cash flow, as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus any non-cash tax benefits from FAS 123R accounting, and excluding unusual non-recurring items.", "In the quarter, free cash flow hit a record $100 million after funding $14 million of CapEx and adding back $6 million of FAS 123R tax benefits, and excluding a $12 million payment associated with the transition of pension plan to 401(k) plan in the U.S. However, free cash flow in Q1 last year was $78 million.", "Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 78 days this quarter, up one day from Q1 last year, without currency effects DSO improved by three days versus prior year. And inventories increased by $21 million this quarter with currency translation comprising about $7 million of this increase.", "And now I would like to turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2008. Given the slower top-line start to the year we experienced with our large pharma customers, and more difficult in economic environment Japan, we believe that a reasonable expectation for sales growth for 2008 would be somewhere in the range of 6 to 8% for organic sales for the full year. Currency of today's levels should add at least 4% to growth this year bringing our overall growth rate to 10 to 12%.", "Moving down to P&L. For the full year, we expect gross margins to improve by about 100 basis points as a result of improved production efficiencies on higher volumes of ACQUITY products, favorable mass spec sales mix that contains more high-end mass spec system sales, our favorable product cost reductions, the favorable foreign currency translation benefit.", "Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate about equal to sales. As the year progresses, we will moderate our spending, our additional resources to keep our expense growth aligned with actual sales volumes.", "We expect our tax rate to be about 18.6% for 2008, and net interest expense is expected to be in the neighborhood of $20 million. And our fully diluted outstanding shares are currently estimated to be about 101 million shares for the full year. Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30 per share where sales growth is between 10 and 12%.", "For Q2 we expect sales growth of 11 to 13%, gross margins should continue to see significant improvements versus prior year, and operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate comparable to sales. Earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be between $0.69 and $0.73 for the second quarter. Doug?", "Douglas A.

Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Well can you talk a bit about sort of the delays we saw in the pharma side both U.S. and Europe and sort of -- was that a trend that we saw sort of throughout the entire quarter where it was just sort of general weakness or do we see any pickup to the end of Q1 that led us to believe that Q2 would sort of be a bit more robust than what we saw from a demand perspective this quarter?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Ross, I'd say we saw pretty consistent across the big pharma universe in terms of what the actual results turned out to be in the first quarter. On the other hand we've -- we saw continual optimism from those accounts, in terms of what they were likely to do. So they didn't spend as optimistically as they talked on balance. But, if you look at early indicators and then you look at some subsequent advances to what we started off the second quarter, I think on balance that's a net positive that there continues to be very high \"activity\" and there continues to be some late blossoming real business out of those accounts.", "So it's not absolutely total, we saw some large accounts actually spend pretty significantly in the quarter, but the general response was low spending by big pharma in the first quarter. But, I'd say the net overall dynamic seems to be pretty positive moving into the rest of the year. That's a tough call, and that's what we try to temper in our outlook of walking that balance between what we saw in the first quarter and expectations for the rest of the year.", "But, I'd say we are coming -- at this point we are cautiously optimistic that we are going to see better performance out of pharma for the rest of the year.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And in terms of the balance of demand for ACQUITY versus Alliance, sort of how would you characterize that in terms of where the weakness was coming from?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well we had another good ACQUITY quarter, so I wouldn't say that there is any sign that ACQUITY penetration is slowing down. But, overall I'd say you did see a better mix of Alliance and ACQUITY in the quarter, and in that -- in some of those traditional Asian pharma accounts that are more weighted towards Alliance and ACQUITY.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And John on the gross margin, it seemed like that was a little bit better than we were looking for in terms of the improvements you saw and what you're guiding for, for the rest of the year?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Is it a function solely of the weakening sort of pound versus the dollar, or is that also sort of more manufacturing efficiencies you're getting out of the move to Singapore than maybe you anticipated when you first guided for the year?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I would say -- I mean certainly we did have favorable manufacturing variances. Some of our cost reductions that we had planned for the year were actually implemented earlier than budgeted. Our manufacturing spend was under plan, we had some favorable variances through manufacturing, volumes in the quarter; we built a little bit more obviously than we anticipated in the quarter versus sales. Our service margins actually were up in the quarter as we've held back a little bit on spend on that side, had some favorable mix on service plans.", "I'd say our product mix was different than we had originally thought, as Doug alluded to, a little bit higher volume of Alliance vis-\u00e0-vis ACQUITY on the mass spec front. We suffered a bit more on the low end singles, which is more research in its orientation. So the service mix was favorable for us. And yes, currency had an impact as well as -- you're right, euro was up 15%, the yen was up 13%, and the pound was relatively flat, so it was the opposite situation that we saw as we came into the year last year.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And one quick maintenance question on share repurchase?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "How many shares did you actually repurchase during the quarter, and what do you have left on the authorization, if anything?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, we purchased 1.3 million shares in the quarter and we have, I think, about 250 or so million left on the $500 million program. So we have significant amount remaining in the program.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, perfect.

Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Hi. Good morning. When you looked at some of the change, I guess, in big pharma spending and you said that, it looks like it's picking up here at the start of the quarter. I guess, how do you manage your inventory in case it either goes up or down from current expectations?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we do it probably pretty much the way everybody does, Quintin. We look at the most recent results in our inventory, whatever the balances are now factored into the production plan for the next two quarters. And since we enter this quarter with a little bit more inventory than we had originally planned, we will take down production plans in those specific product lines over the next two quarters. And we factor in our forecast for the full product complement over the next two quarters. Obviously, there is a lot of science and a little art to that, and -- but you can expect that our production plan for the next two quarters is been revised a little down from our original expectations for the year.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "And then, I guess, has it -- so you said that that the optimism is somewhat there. What changed from, I guess, the first quarter and delays of spending to now where you're starting to see a pickup?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would say throughout the first quarter, while the actual order rate was lower than we had originally budgeted, the response from most of those accounts was still pretty optimistic. And so you always worry about what's coming through that request for quotation, attendance at seminars, because it can be a leading indicator, it can be a false indicator. So I'd say we continue to see very real interests from those large accounts. But of course, we are reading the same things that you are about a number of those accounts facing difficult times. Now, whether those difficult times mean that they'll significantly cut back on strategic R&D programs or not, we've -- we continue to believe that that's not the end result in this industry, that they've got to continue to focus on development programs, at least the industry as a whole does, while individual accounts may face their own bumps and peaks and valleys.", "So, all I'm saying is that what we have seen is a continuation of interest on those accounts, a number of the large tenders that we thought we'd get. Some of those have come through as we started out the quarter. We continue to get a lot of interest on the part of that broad group of customers. And I'd say the net result of all of that is that we are a little bit more optimistic about going into the second quarter than the results we saw in the first quarter.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Last question and I'll jump back into the queue. So, is it possible to decouple, I guess big pharma specific spending versus sales cycle and competitive dynamics. Has anything changed as from the competitive landscape that would have lengthened out a sales cycle?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Now I understand it's a fair question to see -- to ask what we are seeing on the competitive front, but we are not -- none of what we saw in the first quarter was the result of any substantial losses that we saw in those accounts. I'd say, overwhelmingly, it's delays versus lost business. We are not seeing any competitive thrust particularly against things like ACQUITY, particularly in things like the high-end research-grade mass spectrometers. If anything, I'd say, we are even more confident about our strategic positions technologically. So I am not seeing any significant penetration in our traditional dominant account.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Hi. Good morning.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Doug, wondering if actually you can talk a little bit about the academic market, we've seen some mixed signals there as well. So if you can just give us a sense as to what you're hearing from your academic customers, it'd be helpful.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. And maybe, John, you can specifically cite the --", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I think as we look at Waters in total, and we look at the university business, it's flattish. And if we look at it geographically, it's down a little bit in Japan. I'd say it's not something we expect to see for the full year. U.S. was down very little, and I'd say it's a rather small piece of our business overall. But it was not contributing to the growth of the first quarter.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay. And then as we think about the product cycles here, can you just give us a sense coming out of Pittcon, what the level of excitement might be around the new SYNAPT MS in terms of going after a slightly lower price point here and different value proposition for your customers?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Customer response has been very good. I think they are very enthusiastic about now being able to get into SYNAPT technology as a beginning point, and then upgrade to the full high definition subsequently. I'd still say that that high-end market was the one that was delayed more than we had anticipated in the first quarter. I would say we didn't see lost business, but we saw that impacted by delays to a significant extent.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay. And then Doug, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned, I guess, the logistical factors in regards to recurring revenues. Can you elaborate on specifically what that was?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, sure. And I must admit we probably could have anticipated a little bit more of that. Starting out the quarter the way January developed, the first week of the quarter, and some of it calendar, some of it just may be the way our large accounts started off the year, we saw almost across geographies without characterizes calendar delays. Easter falling in the first quarter affected us to a -- to an extent that we now pretty clearly understand. And just as we enter into the second quarter, again in that run-rate business, you see it dramatically different starting off the second quarter than where it started off the first. Again, for no apparent reason other than --", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Calendar.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "What we grossly call calendar effects. So, we think it clearly affected the run rate in the service, in chemistry business, where we are pretty confident that that's an unusual dynamic. We are not seeing any of that as we move through the second quarter.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Jonathan Groberg with Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the call.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Jonathan.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Can you just -- as I look at the numbers geographically that you gave again, I mean, the U.S. seem to be okay, you said plus 9% and seems like really -- I mean there are some of the issues going in Japan, but Europe seemed to be the one that was kind of the most sluggish at minus 2%. Can you maybe just elaborate on what explanation you're hearing from customers? What your sales people are telling you is going on there?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I would say most of the -- you are right. I mean Western Europe was lower than our expectations, and it's one of the question marks as we view the rest of the year. It was principally a pharmaceutical dynamic in Western Europe. Of course, this is all in standard currency terms, or local currency terms, translated it obviously grew significantly better. But I would say it was mostly a pharmaceutical dynamic, mostly a larger pharma dynamic.", "Again we are seeing anticipated better results as we enter the second quarter. We are seeing some pretty tangible signs of that. It sounds like an old record, but a lot of these accounts every year are starting off slower and slower as we think it takes them longer to get their budgets booked. They wait a little longer in the year before they are releasing some of their more significant investments. That seems to be happening as we're speaking. So, again that's one of the reasons why we're a little more confident as we proceed though the year.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "I mean is there any sense after two pretty strong years overall for your company, and better in some of the European markets, is there a sense that people are trying to go and get certain things approved, and they're saying, why do we -- we've just invested in a number of mass specs or a number of HPLC, UPLCs, maybe this money would be better spent elsewhere, or -- I am just curious if it's -- there's a bit of a product cycle?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say, we don't see any sign of that, Jonathan. If you look at where you might look for that \"levels,\" attendance at our seminars, the in -- the kind of less tangible than just simply order rate indicators; we're seeing very robust interest. We're seeing very good continuing interest in the new technologies and the new products. So, we don't see any of those signs. Mostly, what we hear is delayed budgets is the reason for procurement. Now, again we saw some accounts spend pretty robustly. But the net effect of all of that was not what we had hoped.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then, again going back to kind of the guidance you gave at the beginning of the year, and then low -- revenues that were lower, I mean, currency adjust [ph], I guess, were not much a -- were just a percent lower, but organically lower. Can you talk about some of the things you did intra-quarter to deliver on the earnings that you talked about? So I am just -- did you realize half way through the quarter that, hey, maybe the organic sales wasn't going to be quite what we thought. And you did some things intra-quarter to make sure that you could deliver the strong free cash flow and earnings, just -- again I am taking the guidance on what you're expecting for gross margins, and operating expenses and --", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I mean I -- we're -- we tried to draw in our internal forecast and our external forecast somewhat of a middle line of -- between possible -- possible performance and realistic performance. We -- in the first quarter, we obviously had trouble hitting that organic top line that we had anticipated, but I would say we always try to have something in reserve to more significantly increase our bottom line leverage.", "So, we are not all that different from a lot of companies, and we are keeping a little in reserve until we get through the quarter to see whether we release our total spending budget. So, we released less as it became a little clearer to us that we were going to have trouble making the top line. We try our damnedest of course to motivate the sales force and motivate the whole organization to bring those orders in so we can get them shipped. But this quarter we were unable to get all the way to the top and we had some -- we'd geographical areas where it was more of an issue than in others.", "And as we book our budgets on the gross margin front, we always have a number of programs that if they all hit, are going to deliver better performance. In some quarters, two out of three hit, and sometimes, three out of three hit. I'd say this quarter, we saw very good performance out of those manufacturing programs. I think the good part about that is they'll continue to keep contributing for the rest of the year, and we are confident about that.", "So, I don't think it's all on the margin, I'd say. The spending on the margin, we held up in anticipation that -- maybe that top line was going to be difficult to hit. The margin programs kicked in more three out of three than two out of three. The mix was a little a bit favorable to us because of the Alliance ACQUITY mix. And currency was a little bit better because of the way the pound and the euro and the dollar all came together. So, I think the good part about that is almost all of those should be continuing for the rest of the year.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks. Yes, I was just trying to understand the leverage you have to pull, so I appreciate that.", "Last question. Can you just, John or Doug, maybe, explain why you raised the debt, and can you maybe give me a feel as to what you are paying on average for your debt versus what you are receiving on cash? Maybe all your cash is overseas and Europe's are getting higher rates than what you're expecting?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "That's right. I mean we had an opportunity when we put the original revolver in place to go back and up that with the bags in the consortium. And we've talked about beginning that process at the tail end of last year. We executed that in a very difficult environment in the first quarter, and got that done on terms that are very similar to the original agreement.", "We are currently paying about LIBOR plus 60 or so basis points on the debt. And you are right; most of our currency is invested overseas --", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Of our investments.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "On the investment side, right. So, there's a probably a 60, 70 basis point differential between debt costs and interest though -- that we are receiving on our investments net. Obviously, our investments are incredibly conservative in this day and age. No SIVs or CDOs or anything like that, we've got very safe AAA investments on cash invested.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Derik deBruin with UBS.", "Derik deBruin - UBS (US)", "Hi, good morning.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Derik.", "Derik deBruin - UBS (US)", "Doug, correct me if I am wrong, but you basically had a 1 point or a little bit more than that tailwinds organic growth from 4Q, SYNAPT sales that basically didn't ship in 4Q. So now, given that with this tailwind and only a 9% organic growth comp again -- up against 1Q '07, why are you confident that you can hit your implied organic growth number of 7% to 9% in 2Q when you are facing a much more difficult 13% organic comp? I just basically know it's like why isn't this a repeat of 2005.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I think -- I mean if you look at the guidance that we gave for the second quarter, it's likely to have 5 to 6 points of currency again, depending on volume in Europe. So, we are looking for perhaps 6 to 7 organic growth in the second quarter. So comparable growth I'd say to what we saw in the first quarter and that -- the assets up against a more difficult base of comparison, but as Doug said as we look at the business that we've transacted to start the quarter, we're very comfortable that we see improvements in Western Europe, we're seeing improvements in our chemistry and service businesses. So I think we end up in the second quarter feeling better actually as we sit here today on the call than where we were in the first quarter.", "So I don't -- I think the base of comparison is completely accounted for in the 11 to 13% top line given where currency is today.", "Derik deBruin - UBS (US)", "Okay. So when you talk about having more confidence, I guess, are your -- is your feeling coming from the pharma purchasing managers, or is it coming from the people at the lab bench? I mean we've seen it in the past where we -- scientists certainly might want to buy instruments, but then the purchasing managers put the clamp down on the spending. I guess where is your level of confidence coming in from that, from your leads there?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'd say we're not confident enough to take our expectations up significantly over what we saw in the first quarter. I'd say it's -- but I would say our organization probably feels more confident right now than John and I are willing to bank in our formal financial forecast. But, it is true that we're seeing tangible results out of that marketplace that right now you would have to say are probably better than John and I are willing to take to the bank totally.", "So that condition didn't manifest itself in the first quarter, so far it looks like it might in the second quarter and then we very well could be back here saying that the organization was righter than we were. But, it's -- it's early to tell, indications are positive right now, but we've got a long way to go, and we're comfortable with where we're positioning things right now.", "Derik deBruin - UBS (US)", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "John Sullivan with Leerink Swann.", "John L. Sullivan, CFA - Leerink Swann & Company", "Hey guys, good morning.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, John.", "John L. Sullivan, CFA - Leerink Swann & Company", "A couple of quick ones. One bright point in the fourth quarter was some multi-system orders of ACQUITY that you saw, and then in the first quarter, you -- you've just seen a little bit of a shift toward Alliance. Do you think these data points are linked, and can you comment on what the right mix between Alliance and ACQUITY should be expected to be going forward?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I don't really think they're linked John. I think the first quarter is kind of a different animal from the fourth, and I think we just saw a level of beginning of the year conservatism. I mean you've seen the struggles that a number of these accounts have had, and I think they started off the year conservatively; whether they'll continue or not, I think is a fair question, but I don't -- we haven't seen any reduced interest in ACQUITY on the part of these strategic accounts. But, at the same time, a lot of our stronghold areas with Alliance in the QC area particularly in Asia have held up very well. So you see kind of a natural effect of that in the first quarter that I don't think is something that you will necessarily see second, third, and fourth quarter.", "John L. Sullivan, CFA - Leerink Swann & Company", "And just on that, are you still confident that over a longer period of time you'll see Alliance -- I'm sorry you'll see ACQUITY migrate more into the pharma QA/QC setting?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "John L. Sullivan, CFA - Leerink Swann & Company", "Okay. And then lastly regarding your mass spec business and triple quad, specifically there are some reports of more competition and specifically more price competition in triple quad mass spec. But, you're still confident that you're not seeing that as a primary driver?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Our triple quad business was pretty good in the quarter. It's always been a competitive area, John. I'd say it's probably the most competitive area in the mass spec world. I'd say that we feel pretty good about our array of weapons as we move through 2008. So, yes, it's fair to say it's competitive, but I don't see it as more competitive right now than it has been in the near past. And if anything I think we're likely to strengthen that position moving forward.", "John L. Sullivan, CFA - Leerink Swann & Company", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just, John if you could give a little bit more color on the contributions to margins, I know you talked earlier about the currency impact. Of the three factors you highlighted; product cost reduction, favorable mix and the currency translation, can you give us a sense as to how those all factored into the margin improvement?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I'd say if you look at the first manufacturing pieces, they've got the lower manufacturing spend in the quarter as we've kind of held some headcounts open knowing what is coming with some product transfers. We've had accelerated cost reductions, and we've had improved service margins on the cost base there. Maybe that's approaching a third of the improvement. Product mix as we look at the Alliance versus ACQUITY, we look at the low-end of mass spec not doing as well as the tops and triples, providing some favorable mix. That's probably -- maybe that's a third, maybe not approaching a third, but somewhere near that.", "And then the remainder is currency, that's probably a strong third with -- particularly given the year-over-year comparison where last year as you might recall in the first quarter we had a very strong pound versus other currencies, whereas this year it's completely reversed and the pound is relatively flat and the yen and euro were up. So pretty consistent into -- consistent amounts across, I'd say, those three buckets and you will see much of that continue as we make our way into the second quarter.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay. And then to clarify in Doug's comment earlier about Alliance doing well in Asia, the idea is that that may not carry through and have the favorable impact on margins going forward. Is that right?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well we continue to expect Alliance to continue to do well, but relatively going into the second, third, and fourth quarter it may not have the same -- right, and as we look forward, we are not expecting the full 150 basis point improvement year-over-year as mix does somewhat change a bit, but we are still predicting 100 basis points as we look at the next couple of quarters here.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay. And then finally just any incremental data points you can highlight on, on the other businesses -- food, beverage, environmental -- anything we should be thinking about in terms of drivers here?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well we -- I'd say, of note is the interest in environmental and food safety applications particularly in Asia. Boy, we're -- we are seeing groups of interested Asian customers come through our Milford headquarters looking -- and across the product line, looking at data, looking at mass spec, looking at UPLC. A huge amount of interest and I'd say that's probably the most interesting aspect. It's also true that we're seeing interest in North America, but I'd say it's overwhelmed by the amount of interest coming out of Asia.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "And when you're talking about Asia, is it coming out of the China export market or the import market in Japan or --?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's coming -- I'd say it's notable in China, it's notable in other I'd say non-Japanese Asian markets including Korea and Taiwan. Japan, we had a pretty strong base of food safety systems in the Japan business last year. That was almost sure to stop at the rate. We didn't think it was going to stop quite as fast as it did. So I think that's significant just in the quarter-to-quarter dynamics that we saw in the first quarter.", "Overall, Japan had been a very strong performer for us over a number of years, and I think as we move through the current period and work off those base, we will see Japan's results turn into more normalized growth.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan Securities", "Okay, great. Thanks for the taking the follow-up questions.", "Operator", "Steven Solomon with Aroslyn Advisor [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hello, John, just wondering if you could possibly quantify the calendar Easter effect. How big an impact do you think that might have had on sales, I know it's a bit of guesswork.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I think it was probably 2 to 3 percentage points of impact would be my guess. And I'd also say if we look at some of the large pharma, the slow start that we had there had an impact too in the chemistry side of the business, it could have been a couple of points as well. So I -- as Doug had said, as we started the second quarter, we saw that come back with a vengeance.

Baird", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Operator", "Operator", "Good morning. Welcome to the Waters Corporation's Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. And good morning and welcome to this Waters Corporation's second quarter financial results conference call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, the company's Chief Financial Officer and as is our normal practice, I'm going to start with an overview of the quarter's highlights, and John will follow with details on our financial results and then provide you with our outlook for the second half of the year.", "But before we get going, I'll like John to cover the cautionary language, please.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for Q3 and full year 2008. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31st, 2007 in Part-1 under the caption Business Risk Factors. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions.", "We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2008. During this call we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures for reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussion of the results of operations we may refer to pro-forma results which include the impact of purchased intangible amortization and retirement plan, transition changes, and prior period adjustments.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. Our financial results for the first half of 2008 I think truly highlight the strength of Waters business model. With are technologically focused and yet market diversified in global strategy, we've demonstrated an ability to prosper in a very tight spending environment, maybe the toughest conditions that we've seen in our industry in recent years.", "Through the first half of '08, we've grown our sales volume by 13%, our adjusted earnings by 24%, and generated exceptional free cash flow. Needless to say, I'm pleased with our first half performance, and I am encouraged that 2008 will be another successful year for us.", "If you look at the recently completed second quarter results, we experienced a continuation of the trends that we saw here in the first quarter, accompanied by some improvements that we had noted were already materializing when last we spoke. Our business in Europe improved as some delayed capital budgets were released early in the second quarter. And globally, our chemical product sales rebounded from the weakness in the first quarter that was primarily associated with fewer selling days.", "Generally speaking, the key drivers of sales growth in the second quarter were strong demand from developing markets in Asia, continued expansion of our industrial businesses, and another impressive quarter for our TA instruments division.", "Overall, there were few surprises in the quarter. Demand from our pharmaceutical customers, which is a market segment that's been under pressure, was in line with our expectations and was just about flat with the prior year's results. On the other hand, our industrial, chemical, food testing and environment testing segments also had double-digit increases in sales.", "And it's interesting to note that the general economic concerns that we are all hearing about in the news are not reflected in the demand that we're seeing from chemical producers. For the Waters Division, instrumentation sales growth was pretty evenly balanced between chromatography and mass spectrometry.", "ACQUITY UPLC and Tandem Quadrupole MS systems were faster growers, especially outside the classical pharmaceutical applications. Interest in Synapt based systems continues to be strong, primarily for life science applications, such as proteomics and metabolite identifications. And we anticipate a strong second half for these systems.", "Sales growth from our recurring revenue products, including service and chemical consumables positively impacted the quarter's results, as ordering rates for our chromatography columns and sample prep devices rebounded to more typical low double digit rates.", "Geographically the US and Western Europe were positively effected by strong chemical analysis demand, offsetting weak sales from large pharmaceutical accounts. It's important to note that pharmaceutical sales were particularly strong in the second quarter of 2007, and that this year's second quarter results to our largest pharmaceutical accounts were sequentially higher than in the first quarter this year.", "Asia, ex Japan, continued to see strong double-digit sales growth, with all major markets growing nicely. In Japan, we saw an expected modest improvement in our business, due primarily to industrial demand for our new products. On the new product front, I'm pleased to tell you that we enjoyed a very exciting ASMS this year, as we showcase significant new chromatography in mass spectrometry techniques.", "Highlights include our new Xevo Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometers and a preview of our TRIZAIC microfluidic trial base UPLC platform. The Xevo system offers researchers new levels of performance and convenience not before brought together in a tandem Quadrupole system. Incorporating features that enable rapid instrument setup, a new performance optimized ion source and a proprietary scan wave feature for enhanced qualitative analysis. The Xevo defines a new category of tandem Quadrupole systems. And we plan initial customer shipments of Xevo this quarter, and I'm pleased to tell you that interest in this new system is very encouraging.", "TRIZAIC is the new UPLC platform, offering nanoACQUITY chromatographic performance and microfluidic tile format. It's an industry first, TRIZAIC delivers the separation capabilities derived from small particle i.e. ACQUITY packing materials including high-efficiency and fast chromatography and a compact and easy-to-use consumable that's designed to seamlessly integrate with our CINAPS [ph] and Xevo mass spectrometers. TRIZAIC is different from chip-based chromatography platform and that it's compatible with small particle packing materials and the results pressure is that these particles generate.", "We plan to begin shipment of integrated TRIZAIC MS systems next year. Our TA Instruments division delivered another stellar performance in the second quarter. The division saw a balanced growth geographically and benefited from initial shipment of the performance leading ARES-G2 rheometer that was introduced at the Pittsburgh Conference. TAs prospects for the second half of 2008 looks strong, as we anticipate a continuous ramp in demand for our new products, including the ARES-G2 and microcalorimetry systems from recent TA acquisition.", "Over the past few years, TA has demonstrated an ability to rapidly and successfully integrate new instrument technologies into its product line. Given this track record, we will continuously look to acquire new product lines and technologies to accelerate the expansion of TA's business, and we will share more information on this front in the near future. John will walk you through the P&L in some detail; however, I would like to point out that we have continued to improve our operational efficiency through product cost reduction programs and expense management. These improvements in combination with our share repurchases have led to superior profitability and faster earnings growth.", "Through the first half of 2008, we have delivered a record level of free cash flow of more than a $190 million. The period cash flow provides us with a flexibility to further enhance the value of our company, through accretive acquisition, share repurchases or the retirement debt. Looking towards the second half of 2008 and into 2009, I'm encouraged that we'll be able to maintain the momentum that has benefited us for the first six months of '08. So we expect global economic conditions are unlikely to improve in the near term.", "We feel that our strong product position, the continuing expansion of our businesses in the developing world and the sustainability of our recurring revenues in total position us very favorably for the future. However, understanding the economic and political uncertainties that all companies are facing in the coming quarters, we will remain cautious in our financial outlook and will pursue a balanced strategy that will involve the continued commercialzation of our new instrument systems and technologies with a careful eye to growing profitability and maintaining a high level of cash generation.", "With that, I would now like to turn it over to John.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Second quarter results delivered 13% sales growth and 27% growth in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. Earnings per share were $0.76 this quarter, compared to $0.60 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.82 this quarter, compared to $0.59 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Included in our income statement this quarter is an $0.08 EPS benefit related to a cumulative adjustment of prior periods. For several years, we have been capitalizing and amortizing software development costs on our US books [ph] and tax affect the net income statement impact of these items at US tax rates. We recently realized that because of all of the economic rights to this capitalized software reside in one of our Irish subsidiaries, we should have tax affected their net impact at Irish tax rates. Across a 10-year period, the cumulative impact of this overcharge is $0.14.", "Additionally because these capitalized software amounts were accounted for as a US asset, it was not amortized in appreciated euros across the same time frame, which resulted in understating our cost of sales by $0.06. The net impact of this correction is then an increased earnings this quarter of $0.08. These amounts are immaterial to all prior periods and, therefore, have been recorded as a prior period adjustment this quarter. On a going forward basis, the impact of this change will be a decrease in our tax rate this year of nearly 1% and an increase in cost of sales that will reduce our gross margin by nearly 25 basis points. The net P&L impact for 2008 is essentially neutral.", "Turning now to our operational performance for Q2; sales grew by 13% this quarter with currency providing 6 percentage points of growth. Looking at corporate sales growth regionally and before foreign exchange effects, sales in the US were up 6% this quarter and within Europe, sales were up 3%. Sales within Japan remained somewhat soft and were down by 6% and sales in Asia outside of Japan remained strong and were up 22%.", "Turning to the product front, within the Waters division, Instrument systems grew by 3% against a very strong base of comparison. Our service business grew by 11% and chemistry had 11% growth as well. Our TA Instruments division had another strong quarter with sales up 15% versus prior year, resulting from strong new product sales.", "Now I would like to comment on non-GAAP margins and expenses, excluding the items noted in this morning's press release. Gross margin remained strong this quarter and came in at 58.2%. Versus prior year, margins expanded by about 140 basis points. We continue to benefit from product cost reductions, favorable product mix and currency translation. SG&A expenses grew by about 10% this quarter compared to prior year, and were heavily influenced by currency translation.", "R& D expenses grew by 16% as new product introduction costs raised our spending somewhat this quarter. We currently expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 17.5%. To adjust year-to-date taxes within the second quarter, our Q2 tax rate is 16.9%. The decline in our full year effective rate is principally the result of the capitalized software adjustment I previously described. On the stock buyback front, we continue to repurchase our shares in the open market, and during the second quarter we purchased 1.25 million shares of our common stock for $77.6 million. Fully diluted average share count was 101 million shares for the quarter.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $831 million, and debt totaled $984 million, bringing us to a net debt position of about $153 million.", "We measure free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any non-cash tax benefit from FAS 123R accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. For the quarter, free cash flow was $89 million after funding $18 million of CapEx. Comparable free cash flow in Q2 last year was $91 million, and for the first half of 2008 our free cash flow is up 12%.", "Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, equal to Q1 last year. And without currency effects, DSO improved by about three days versus prior year.", "Inventories increased about $10 million this quarter with currency translation comprising $3 million of the increase.", "Now, I would like to turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2008. Our second quarter sales results were in line with our prior expectations, and we believe the current business conditions remain comparable to those we assessed last quarter. Therefore, we continue to believe that we will be able to deliver sales growth in the range of 6% to 8% before currency effects. Currency at today's levels should add about 5% to growth this year bringing our overall growth to 11% to 13%.", "Moving down to P&L; for the full year, we expect gross margins to improve by about 120 basis points, as a result of improved production efficiencies on higher production volumes, favorable mass spec sales mix, product cost reductions and continued favorable foreign currency translation effects.", "Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate above/equal to sales. We will moderate our spending on additional resources to keep our expense growth aligned with actual sales volumes. We expect our tax rate to be about 17.5% for the remainder of 2008, incorporating a lower tax rate on capitalized software costs.", "Net interest expense is expected to be in the neighborhood of $20 million.", "And our fully diluted average shares outstanding are currently estimated to be about 101 million shares for the full year.", "Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35 per share, where sales growth is between 11% and 13%. For Q3 we expect sales growth of 11% to 12%. Gross margins should continue to see significant improvements versus prior year. And operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate comparable to sales.", "Earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be between $0.73 and $0.77 for the third quarter. Doug.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. And operator, I think at this point we could open it up for Q&A.", "QUESTION AND ANSWER", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on a good quarter.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "I wanted to talk about the developing market, specifically China. There was a recent GDP report that was slightly below trend over the last several quarters. And you guys obviously had really nice growth this quarter, 20% plus. Are you seeing any sort of slacking of demand there and where would you characterize the different pockets of strength or weakness within that market?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Russ, we're seeing -- I'd say we've seeing remarkably consistent demand from China for a while now. In the second quarter, there was remarkably no change from the last several quarters. Actually, in China, I'd say it's a pretty balanced mix across our typical applications, including pharmaceutical.", "But I would say the strongest areas continue to be in what we classify as industrial applications, environmental, food and beverage are particularly strong, and food and beverage, it's both in quality evaluation and in regulated export type of applications.", "A lot of soft drink applications growing in ample, Southeast Asia marketplace, so I'd say it's -- and that's what we've seen consistently. I'd say it didn't particularly move in the most recent quarter.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And, you know, as we look to the consumable piece of the business, you saw a nice rebound off of Q1 levels. Can you talk about sort of the differential there? Was there any impact from more selling days in the quarter or was that just purely sort of demand related making up for some of the weakness we saw in Q1?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We think that the weakness that we saw in the first quarter was largely due to calendar items, the timing of Easter and the way the yearend fell versus the way the first quarter ended, losing a couple of selling days on top of Easter. It might have been just a smidge of formal weakness that creeps in there, but by far we thought it was calendar items.", "And, in fact, the second quarter largely returned to our traditional low double-digit growth rates across those product lines. So we're pretty confident that the first quarter was the anomaly and that our business in that area is pretty predictable going forward at this current rate.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thanks, guys, I'll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Hi. Good morning. Congratulations on nice quarter as well.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Quintin.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "With respect to the European, I guess return to spending from some of your big pharmaceutical customers, did you see just a gradual increase or did you see kind of a make up from Q1 and Q2? And can you talk a little bit about, you know, do you see -- is it drug discovery, is it moving to CROs or any kind of color on that return?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I wouldn't have you believe that Europe is all that different from what we're experiencing across the pharmaceutical marketplace. We did see -- because we saw some specific orders that we thought were delayed in the first quarter. We did pick those up in the second quarter, so that, you know, helps us believe that our sales intelligence is working. But overall, I'd say the Euro phrama market is pretty consistent with the US pharma market and that's very cautious.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "And then, with respect to gross margin, I think that as input prices -- input costs seem to be going up, like steel, copper, resin costs, you've been able to still, in fact, if anything, increase your gross margin expansion expectations.", "So tell us a little bit about how you are dealing with the cost of the input prices for you and what is the pricing environment for your products to be able to pass that through to your customers? If you need to.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a very fair question. I would say we're seeing some pockets of strength in producer pricing and, you know, certainly in the freight area, anything that requires fuel, we're certainly hearing rumblings and we've seen some real increases. In some areas, where we deal with some reasonably rare metals in our products, we're seeing some movement to higher pricing.", "But it represents a relatively small part of the overall inputs to our product line. And I would say what you're seeing is the continual focus on driving improved processes to the ACUITY product line, to a lesser extent on a number of our other product lines.", "But also the fact that as our new mass spec products come online, they're inherently better margins and as they take up a better overall level of the sales volume, that's what here John referred to as product mix, a lot of that is happening in our product line as these. As we drive efficiency through the plants, we're getting just a better, you know, gross margin mix of the existing sales volume.", "So that's -- we've been talking about that with ACUITY. We continue to focus on it, that when we introduced it, it's at a high point in its cost structure and we continuously move that along and that's really what you're seeing, combined with some benefit from the foreign exchange -- you know, the weakness in the dollar.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird.", "Thank you for that. And then last question and I'll jump back in the queue, for the second half of this year, your tax rate assumption, so should we just assume kind of that 18.5 or 18.6 range?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "No. As we go through the second half, we're currently expecting about a 17.5% rate, Quintin. And that incorporates the going forward effect of the cap software. So that's offset by a slightly higher cost of sale associated with higher amortization costs, the FX piece of the amortization costs. So 17.5% rate for us now is the rate we expect to see for the future.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird.", "I see, so what we saw here in this quarter continues on for the next couple of quarters, then?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, yes.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird.", "Okay. And then when does that anniversary, then, Q1 of next year?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Well I mean next year we'll have to reassess again what the rate will be just given the mix of income across legal entities. But until the situation changes with cap software and perhaps there's a different mix of how much is being capitalized versus amortized, the 17.5% rate is likely to stay at least for the next couple of quarters or perhaps a longer.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. As we look at next year for that the effect of cap software in and of itself, we don't think that's going to be a significant dynamic in moving that 17.5% tax rate.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, if everything works out in our plan, and you know, tax rates are not the easiest thing as we're seeing to forecast, all other things being equal, we'd expect it to be around the 17.5% next year, also.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "That's right.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Good morning.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "In a seemingly tough raw material environment, you increased your expected year-over-year full year gross margin improvement from 100 basis points to 120 basis points. You pointed to mass spec as one driver to why you expect the gross margins to improve year-over-year. Does this imply anything about changes in end market dynamics or your market share expectations for the full year?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, not really. I mean, you know, we think it's a tough marketplace out there and we think we've got new -- good new products, so I wouldn't shy away from saying we think we are doing better than many others in the marketplace. But I think the margin dynamics just are kind of as we explained it, foreign exchange is better, the efficiencies in our existing product lines are better.", "And as we've introduced in the mass spec area, you know, with the new products came in with a better cost configuration than the old products and we didn't have to trade down on price, so we just have the better gross margin dynamic as they take up a bigger share of our mass spec volume. So that's really what's happening there.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "And as Doug explained earlier, you know, the impact of commodity pricing really hasn't come through in our cost of sales in a big way. So I'm certain in other environments or other companies that is much larger issue, but for us, it's just isn't right now.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The reason, how that affects our business is to factor in why we are cautious in getting more exuberant about the potentials to grow faster, we think the cost dynamics may affect our customers a little bit more than they affect us, and that's why we continue to look a little more cautiously at our top line growth, but we don't think it's going to have a material impact. It does have an impact, you know, we do have a lot of travel costs, our sales force travels and so we've factored that into our budget estimates, but we think it's in there at a reasonable level.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay, that is helpful. And then maybe another guidance question. Could I just confirm that there were no changes in your year-over-year expectations for pharma demand incorporated in to your new guidance? And as a follow up to that, keeping in mind the recent announcements from Roche-Genentech to have a bar, can you talk about how consolidation in big pharma and biotech may impact demand and pricing moving forward?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think in general the level of potential consolidation going on in big pharma isn't as material as it was, you know, when Pfizer bought Pharmacia or Warner Lambert or when Glaxo bought Wellcome and others. So I think the level that we're looking about well, could influence those companies in their\u2026their investments. You know Roche owned half of Genentech anyway. I don't think it's likely to have a huge impact there.", "So, you know, overall, I'm not feeling all that bad about what's likely to happen on that score, but we're forecasting the second half to be conditions along the lines of what we're seeing now. We're not expecting a robust improvement in the pharmaceutical world.", "I would tell you that some of the pharmaceutical accounts are talking about a better second half, but they have delayed investments and that they think they'll be investing in the second half. I can also tell you we're not taking a significant amount of that to the bank in our forecast. So if it happens, I think we'll benefit from it, but it's\u2026 I think it's still a tough environment for those larger pharmaceutical accounts.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Great. And if I could just ask one more question and then I'll get back in the queue. You talked about strong indications in terms of demand for Xevo. Could you share anything in terms of which end markets have been\u2026 in which end markets were you seeing the strongest interest?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Interestingly enough, as you probably know, our market share in the Quantitative Bioanalysis segment isn't that great, hasn't been for the last, five or six years for a number of reasons. Some restructuring on the part of some competitors. I think a lot of those traditional accounts have started looking at alternate suppliers.", "So we're seeing a great deal of interest in some of those traditional pharmaceutical markets, about Xevo in particular, and I think, you know, some of it's just being careful on their part, and I won't say that we are seeing a lot of that manifest itself in real business yet, but it's an encouraging sign.", "Sailing [ph] that its Xevo basically now operates\u2026 incorporates some significant qualitative features into what traditionally has been a more quantitative set of customer applications. We're seeing interest in the academic world, in the governmental world, as well as in our classical applied markets in food and beverage and environmental.", "So it's encouraging, but I think it will be another couple of quarters before we can really point to tangible business that I can report, yeah, we think we've taken some share here.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Great. Well, thanks again for taking all the questions.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just actually asking Doug's earlier question in another way on the competitive front, are you seeing anything meaningful in terms of share shift, in terms of, you know, competitive bid activity picking up or anything out of the ordinary?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You mean specifically in pharma or --", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Yes. Both pharma and academics, so\u2026", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would not say anything on the competitive front, Tycho, that's of real note. I would say just in the pharma world, as I said, we're seeing customers that say they want and need instrumentation, but they have delayed. I can say in one or two cases as we've gone into the third quarter, early on we've seen some of that business fall in.", "But I wouldn't say that it's\u2026 it reflects a big difference in what those accounts are doing competitively or they're looking for more quotes. My anecdotes on the triple quad side are just that, anecdotes and, as I say, I think we'll have to see that play out over the next six months.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then with regards to the carry over from last quarter, you had some orders that got pushed through and then the Easter impact, could you just quantify the impact of what that was and then also, the margin contribution this quarter from FX mix and cost reduction.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think the calendar effect was largely on our consumables and service side of the business, and that\u2026 all in that business went from about 7%, I think, growth in the first quarter to low double-digits in the second quarter. So\u2026and low double digits is what we always kind of expect out of that business because it's very reliable and predictable, and so we thought 2 to 3 points kind of was the effect on that consumables business in the first quarter.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Yeah.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's much tougher call. We intuitively thought there was some effect on the Instrument side, but not as quantifiable and it's a lumpier consideration. In terms of the\u2026", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "The margin contributions, and just the relative impact of FX and cost reduction.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "FX was --", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "About a half.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Better than half, just better than half in the quarter. Currency was a little better than I thought it would be, versus the initial expectations, so we ended up with a bit more of an impact from FX this time around and then the cost reductions in the mix are probably about equally weighted, you know, maybe 20%, 25% each, something like that.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then you had at PITTCON introduced something for the QA, QC market with the patrol [ph]. Are you still kind of thinking that's a longer term, couple of year ramp there, are you seeing anything from a regulatory standpoint?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we actually didn't budget for\u2026 anything meaningful this year. We're still working with thought-mirror [ph] accounts to really work on the sampling end of it and making sure that we can reliably in a rugged environment deliver the kind of performance that they need.", "So we didn't anticipate that was going to be a big dynamic this year. I would suggest probably into the second half of '09 when we'll really\u2026we are hopeful that we can bring that to a reliable ongoing source of revenue.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then finally, just for John, did you say the normalized tax rate was 16.9% in the quarter?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "No, the run rate tax -- the tax rate going forward that we should use is 17.5%.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "16.9, takes into account the impact of adjusting the year-to-date rates within the quarter, so for the second half of the year, 17.5 is what we're expecting.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. So what was the normalized tax rate, then, for the quarter?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "17.5.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "17.5, okay.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Because of the catch-up, because the first quarter's rate was 18.6 and we want to bring the year-to-date to 17.5. We had to bring the rate down in the quarter to 16.9. Okay. So 17.5 is the rate we should think about for 2008.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you very much.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Derik deBruin with UBS.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Hi, good morning.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "You know, your TA business has just continued to just outperform beyond all expectations. You know, and you've done -- you've tucked in some nice acquisitions in there and done like that. I guess  -- talk a little bit more about that market and other acquisition opportunities out there and, I guess, was the 21% -- I mean was there any acquisition in the number this quarter?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "15%. The growth rate for TA we said was 15%.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Okay.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "And there is probably a couple of points, maybe, of rollover M&A in there, it's rather small.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "But then for the overall business, it's like 13.5% for the overall business?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, yes. Absolutely.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Okay. What other opportunities are there out there in the TA markets?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "There are a number of opportunities. I would characterize them. They're not huge sales revenue acquisition opportunities. They tend to be on the smaller side. There are some that are maybe in the 40 to $50 million revenue side, but I wouldn't say we have many of those targeted right now.", "There are a lot of applications that surround these industrial markets that are available for augmenting our current product line. So, you know, this is one area where I think on average doing one or two things a year is imminently doable.", "They'll tend to be on the smaller side. That's the -- but they keep this business, I think, predictable double-digit grower over the long term. If you just look at the product lines and the applications that it's serving, this business continues to bring new products, particularly the new rheometer product. It's a leader in the marketplace and a lot of natural growth just from upgrading the installed base that hasn't seen a new instrument here in a while. So I think the next two, three quarters are very predictable from the source of growth that is driving the business today.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Okay. You've done about -- your growth margin is up 120 basis points this year. How much more room is there when you start looking out at 2009? I mean is there another 100 points variance there over the next couple of years?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't if I would quote a 100 basis points. I'm little too conservative I think to predict anything of that nature. I mean obviously we've had the benefit of foreign exchange. We're going to anniversary that. You could argue next year, so it's unlikely that you're going to see the improvement again associated with foreign exchange.", "But on the other hand, I would say that on the product cost side, you know, we continue to identify opportunities for cost reduction on the ACUITY product, some of which you've seen, some of which is still in the works. We've recently transferred a couple of our HPLC detectors to Singapore, they're ramping up. So, we're going to see some cost reductions from those.", "So I'd say from the normal course of business, outside of foreign exchange, you know, that 10, 20 basis points of improvement that we generally look for every year, I'd say looks very positive, given the opportunities that we have on the cost reduction side.", "And I do think, as we look at the chemistry business going forward, to the extent that the installed base of ACUITY continues to grow, we're likely to see that being beneficial to our growth rate on the chemistry products, which will likewise improve margins. So I think, a little bit of that mix will continue.", "The product cost reductions look good for the next couple of years. I don't think that translates perhaps -- you know, maybe we're talking 40, 50 basis points, it's not going to be 100 basis points and then currency is anyone's guess I'd say at this stage.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "That's helpful. I guess in the -- you know, where have you seen your biggest pockets of growth from, in Asia? Has it been mostly the industrial, chemical, from that standpoint?", "And is that across \u2013 and then between TA business, let's just talk about the Waters specific business. Where has been the greatest market growth is coming from in that market?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if you look at region, our countries, outside of Japan, we've seen strength almost everywhere. And it's somewhat geographical. If you look at the smaller markets like Thailand, Vietnam, we're certainly seeing a lot of food analysis business there.", "If you look at Korea, you know, we see a lot of industrial applications, but also a good mix of pharmaceutical. China, as I said before, is a very balanced mix across pharmaceutical applications, food and beverage, governmental labs.", "So I'd say, you know, China is kind of across all the fronts and that's the biggest marketplace for us in Asia. India is principally pharmaceutical and that continues -- that pharmaceutical market continues to grow, a good double-digit basis. So I'd say India is the most homogenous of all of our markets.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Some people have raised some questions about does China slow after the Olympics and how cyclical is the food safety analysis as people get worried about food prices and things like that, have you heard anything to suggest that those markets could potentially slow?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "First thing is, I don't think any of our business has been affected really on the upside from the Olympics. So it's not like we've got a big bolus of business that's coming in for that, other than maybe some environmental testing in general, you might say is influenced by, you know, the Chinese wanting to clean up their environment.", "But most of what we're seeing is much more infrastructure, has more of a long-term feel to it. We don't -- if anything, I think we think the food safety opportunity in China is much bigger. We think the soft drink analysis and testing market is bigger, both in China and throughout that area.", "So, you know, it's -- you can't ever tell in these somewhat command economies what the command will decide to do, but I think it's going to be awfully hard to radically change the path that they're on in a lot of these applications. We get no sense that they're tapping out, certainly not in the next couple of quarters. And I wouldn't say we're seeing any advance signs of it.", "So your guess and others' are as good as ours in terms of what the '09, '10 pretends, but I think it's going to be tough for them to move out of this cycle that they're in.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Isaac Ro with Leerink Swann.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, sorry about that. Real quick on new product introductions, such as Xevo and TRIZAIC. Can you talk a little bit about how customer evaluation times might be changing relative to the total capital spending environment you mentioned?", "And then secondly on those products, how do you think margins compare on those systems relative to your corporate average for instrumentation?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The margins will be -- will not negatively influence\u2026", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "About average at the introduction. Yeah. With longer term opportunity to improve.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's right. I'd say in the evaluation side, it's bimodal. In applied markets, it's -- we don't think -- again, we're early on in the introduction. We don't think it's going to be particularly long, because what we're really offering is a new capability with the qualitative capability in Xevo.", "In the Quantitative Bioanalysis market, I think that's likely to be a more traditional evaluation process. So that's one reason why I was saying it's going to be another six months before we probably have a good feeling in that marketplace, how this is going to shape up in terms of market share.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Okay, great. And then just taking another look at maybe lateral impacts of M&A and the drug industry, can you maybe talk about how your business with CROs has increased either as a percentage of your total customer base or on an absolute basis in recent years? For example are you doing more business with a measurably larger number of CROs today or just doing more business with the same larger players in that market?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'd say in general in the western world, our business with CROs has been the strongest part of our pharmaceutical industry or one of the strongest; generics have been very strong too. And for the most part those CROs have been the same names that you would have recognized five years ago, they've just been growing much faster and they've been investing in instrumentation much faster.", "The place where we've seen new\u2026and some of it's, you know, just different corporate names, is in Eastern Europe and in India where you're seeing new CROs come on the scene and new business opportunities there. We don't disclose particularly what those CROs grow, but your assumption is correct, it's been growing in the double digits consistently and it's been a strong part of the pharma business.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Great, and lastly on\u2026just in the first quarter call, I think you mentioned a major pharma customer that delayed or having a specially delayed capital spending cycle in the first quarter. Can you see whether or not that customer or if it was a group of them had snapped back in the quarter or at least normal\u2026", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'd say in specifics that was related to Europe, and we did as I said before, that business did come in. We're seeing similar kinds, you know, it's always a question of something moves out of the first into the second, so something move out of the second into the third?", "We've seeing perhaps even a little bit more of that kind of anecdote at the end of the second quarter and, in fact, we've seeing some of that business come in already in the third quarter.", "So we're kind of monitoring that very closely because it's possible that that business could turn a little bit more favorable than we think. But we're very cautious about taking one or two data points and thinking that this war is won.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "John Groberg with Merrill Lynch.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for taking the call. Congratulations on a very solid quarter. Can I ask John, I need a couple of clarification questions? What was your contribution from acquisitions? I know you had a Calorimetry acquisition, and then also what was the...", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "That added maybe a couple of percentage points to the 15% TA, without it might have been 13.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It is less than a point.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "It's well under a point for the full corporation.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And the FX impact of the bottom line. I know you talked about the gross margin impact, but can you quantify?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "It ends up being about a penny for every percent on the top line, so it's around a 6%ish bottom line impact for the quarter.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "$0.06, you mean?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then if I got the numbers right, you said US and local currency grew 6, Europe 3, Japan was down 6, and Asia was 22%. I think in Japan you had easier comps from the second quarter of '07 relative to the first quarter. Just curious.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "They get easier across the year. The second quarter was still a bit more difficult. I mean in constant currencies, Japan grew 8% in the second quarter; the minor 6 was pulling currency out. And then comps the get considerably easier in Q3 and Q4. Our expectation would be that Japan should flatten out to show some growth as we move through the second half.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "I'm sorry, so the numbers you gave were the negative were\u2026 the 6% included currency, then, and in local currency Japan grew 8%?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Whenever I talk about regional growth, I talk about it stripping currency out, so --", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Because the Japanese currency\u2026", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "(inaudible) benefit of currency went down 6%, but, again, if you just looked at it in Yen, it would have been an 8% increase.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no. Let's make sure. In standard currency, in Yen.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "It was down 6%.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We thought [ph] 6%.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Because of the Yen strength.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Because you had the Yen strengthening, that raised the translated numbers to grow.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "I am sorry, that's right.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So you were right John. So in real organic terms, Japan was not -- it wasn't down as much as it was in the first quarter.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And we think that's the trend. It will improve in the second half of the year.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "My overall question there on Japan was it looks like it's improving, but still kind of difficult, so I was trying to get an update on that.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we share that. We think the worst is behind us. We had some very tough comps coming into the year. You know, Japan pharma in particular, is not strong, but we're seeing the applied markets and the chemical analysis piece to be reasonably optimistic.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And what was your\u2026 you mentioned the growth. What's kind of your split now between the overall pharma, life science, everyone defines it and industrial chemical? Where do you see that kind of in your internal plans? Where do you see that being, you know, a few, three to five years from now? It sounds like you're really focusing on expanding that industrial chemical piece of your overall exposure.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's true, but pharma, broadly defined pharma is a trade class. It's still the largest piece of our business. So that represents all in about 60% of our worldwide revenue. But it is true that food and beverage, environmental and those applied industrial markets are growing faster today.", "You know, I'd still say we see real opportunities for good, solid growth in the pharmaceutical market, maybe not from, you know, the traditional largest pharmas, but including CROs, including the developing markets of eastern Europe and in Asia and in generic drug manufacturers, there's still\u2026 we grew that business in the first quarter.", "It was flattish in the second quarter, and we still see opportunities for real growth going forward, particularly there comes a point when a lot of these companies that have delayed and delayed and delayed have got to invest in more of their replacement products. So we think there will be pent up replacement in demand even in some of the accounts that are pretty weak right now.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "But for you guys, I mean historically I guess, I think it has been 75% life science, 25% more industrial. Is that\u2026 is that either via acquisition or where you're focusing growth? I know what you said, but do you anticipate that changes?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think you include the government academic when you get up to the 75% level.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Sure.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know, so the 60% I was talking about is just pharmaceutical. We're still at about that 75% level if you include government academic applications.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And my question was more just three to five years, either via acquisitions, where you focus your acquisitions or what's your --", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely, I think you can say that right now we see that industrial world, we see TA in specific kind of outgrowing our Waters business right now, and we're focusing our acquisition activity there, but it would just be wrong to think that that 75% is going to go to 45% or something like that. It -- on the fringe, industrial will probably grow faster in the next couple of years.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And you don't have some kind of, I don't know if you had an internal three to five-year target of what you'd like that mix to be, I guess, is kind of --", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "No. I'd like that pharmaceutical world to go back to double-digit growth.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then last question, you know, Doug, you defined this as one of the most difficult spending environments in some time, but you still put up a good quarter. I'm just curious, did the timing in the quarter play out differently than it has for you in the past? I know a lot of your sales come in kind of in the last three weeks to a month.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think, you know, materially so. I would say, you know, at some points in the quarter, like all quarters, it looked like it would be better and then maybe a few of those large accounts that have been talking about, you know, that we really thought were going to buy this quarter pushed out into the next quarter or two.", "So if you had talked to me at one point in the quarter, John, if I were willing to say anything to you, of course, I might have been a little bit more optimistic, but, you know, that happens to some extent in a lot of quarters, so I just think what we're seeing is that in the large\u2026 particularly large pharma accounts, you get one piece of that constituency saying we've got to spend, we've got to move these projects ahead and then as it comes time to actually spend the money, they get a little bit more cautious sometimes. We think that that could change, but it hasn't changed significantly at this point.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks a million.", "Operator", "Sir, at this time I show no questions.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, very good.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation's Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. And good morning and welcome to this Waters Corporation's second quarter financial results conference call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, the company's Chief Financial Officer and as is our normal practice, I'm going to start with an overview of the quarter's highlights, and John will follow with details on our financial results and then provide you with our outlook for the second half of the year.", "But before we get going, I'll like John to cover the cautionary language, please.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for Q3 and full year 2008. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31st, 2007 in Part-1 under the caption Business Risk Factors. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions.", "We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2008. During this call we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures for reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussion of the results of operations we may refer to pro-forma results which include the impact of purchased intangible amortization and retirement plan, transition changes, and prior period adjustments.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. Our financial results for the first half of 2008 I think truly highlight the strength of Waters business model. With are technologically focused and yet market diversified in global strategy, we've demonstrated an ability to prosper in a very tight spending environment, maybe the toughest conditions that we've seen in our industry in recent years.", "Through the first half of '08, we've grown our sales volume by 13%, our adjusted earnings by 24%, and generated exceptional free cash flow. Needless to say, I'm pleased with our first half performance, and I am encouraged that 2008 will be another successful year for us.", "If you look at the recently completed second quarter results, we experienced a continuation of the trends that we saw here in the first quarter, accompanied by some improvements that we had noted were already materializing when last we spoke. Our business in Europe improved as some delayed capital budgets were released early in the second quarter. And globally, our chemical product sales rebounded from the weakness in the first quarter that was primarily associated with fewer selling days.", "Generally speaking, the key drivers of sales growth in the second quarter were strong demand from developing markets in Asia, continued expansion of our industrial businesses, and another impressive quarter for our TA instruments division.", "Overall, there were few surprises in the quarter. Demand from our pharmaceutical customers, which is a market segment that's been under pressure, was in line with our expectations and was just about flat with the prior year's results. On the other hand, our industrial, chemical, food testing and environment testing segments also had double-digit increases in sales.", "And it's interesting to note that the general economic concerns that we are all hearing about in the news are not reflected in the demand that we're seeing from chemical producers. For the Waters Division, instrumentation sales growth was pretty evenly balanced between chromatography and mass spectrometry.", "ACQUITY UPLC and Tandem Quadrupole MS systems were faster growers, especially outside the classical pharmaceutical applications. Interest in Synapt based systems continues to be strong, primarily for life science applications, such as proteomics and metabolite identifications. And we anticipate a strong second half for these systems.", "Sales growth from our recurring revenue products, including service and chemical consumables positively impacted the quarter's results, as ordering rates for our chromatography columns and sample prep devices rebounded to more typical low double digit rates.", "Geographically the US and Western Europe were positively effected by strong chemical analysis demand, offsetting weak sales from large pharmaceutical accounts. It's important to note that pharmaceutical sales were particularly strong in the second quarter of 2007, and that this year's second quarter results to our largest pharmaceutical accounts were sequentially higher than in the first quarter this year.", "Asia, ex Japan, continued to see strong double-digit sales growth, with all major markets growing nicely. In Japan, we saw an expected modest improvement in our business, due primarily to industrial demand for our new products. On the new product front, I'm pleased to tell you that we enjoyed a very exciting ASMS this year, as we showcase significant new chromatography in mass spectrometry techniques.", "Highlights include our new Xevo Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometers and a preview of our TRIZAIC microfluidic trial base UPLC platform. The Xevo system offers researchers new levels of performance and convenience not before brought together in a tandem Quadrupole system. Incorporating features that enable rapid instrument setup, a new performance optimized ion source and a proprietary scan wave feature for enhanced qualitative analysis. The Xevo defines a new category of tandem Quadrupole systems. And we plan initial customer shipments of Xevo this quarter, and I'm pleased to tell you that interest in this new system is very encouraging.", "TRIZAIC is the new UPLC platform, offering nanoACQUITY chromatographic performance and microfluidic tile format. It's an industry first, TRIZAIC delivers the separation capabilities derived from small particle i.e. ACQUITY packing materials including high-efficiency and fast chromatography and a compact and easy-to-use consumable that's designed to seamlessly integrate with our CINAPS [ph] and Xevo mass spectrometers. TRIZAIC is different from chip-based chromatography platform and that it's compatible with small particle packing materials and the results pressure is that these particles generate.", "We plan to begin shipment of integrated TRIZAIC MS systems next year. Our TA Instruments division delivered another stellar performance in the second quarter. The division saw a balanced growth geographically and benefited from initial shipment of the performance leading ARES-G2 rheometer that was introduced at the Pittsburgh Conference. TAs prospects for the second half of 2008 looks strong, as we anticipate a continuous ramp in demand for our new products, including the ARES-G2 and microcalorimetry systems from recent TA acquisition.", "Over the past few years, TA has demonstrated an ability to rapidly and successfully integrate new instrument technologies into its product line. Given this track record, we will continuously look to acquire new product lines and technologies to accelerate the expansion of TA's business, and we will share more information on this front in the near future. John will walk you through the P&L in some detail; however, I would like to point out that we have continued to improve our operational efficiency through product cost reduction programs and expense management. These improvements in combination with our share repurchases have led to superior profitability and faster earnings growth.", "Through the first half of 2008, we have delivered a record level of free cash flow of more than a $190 million. The period cash flow provides us with a flexibility to further enhance the value of our company, through accretive acquisition, share repurchases or the retirement debt. Looking towards the second half of 2008 and into 2009, I'm encouraged that we'll be able to maintain the momentum that has benefited us for the first six months of '08. So we expect global economic conditions are unlikely to improve in the near term.", "We feel that our strong product position, the continuing expansion of our businesses in the developing world and the sustainability of our recurring revenues in total position us very favorably for the future. However, understanding the economic and political uncertainties that all companies are facing in the coming quarters, we will remain cautious in our financial outlook and will pursue a balanced strategy that will involve the continued commercialzation of our new instrument systems and technologies with a careful eye to growing profitability and maintaining a high level of cash generation.", "With that, I would now like to turn it over to John.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Second quarter results delivered 13% sales growth and 27% growth in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. Earnings per share were $0.76 this quarter, compared to $0.60 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.82 this quarter, compared to $0.59 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Included in our income statement this quarter is an $0.08 EPS benefit related to a cumulative adjustment of prior periods. For several years, we have been capitalizing and amortizing software development costs on our US books [ph] and tax affect the net income statement impact of these items at US tax rates. We recently realized that because of all of the economic rights to this capitalized software reside in one of our Irish subsidiaries, we should have tax affected their net impact at Irish tax rates. Across a 10-year period, the cumulative impact of this overcharge is $0.14.", "Additionally because these capitalized software amounts were accounted for as a US asset, it was not amortized in appreciated euros across the same time frame, which resulted in understating our cost of sales by $0.06. The net impact of this correction is then an increased earnings this quarter of $0.08. These amounts are immaterial to all prior periods and, therefore, have been recorded as a prior period adjustment this quarter. On a going forward basis, the impact of this change will be a decrease in our tax rate this year of nearly 1% and an increase in cost of sales that will reduce our gross margin by nearly 25 basis points. The net P&L impact for 2008 is essentially neutral.", "Turning now to our operational performance for Q2; sales grew by 13% this quarter with currency providing 6 percentage points of growth. Looking at corporate sales growth regionally and before foreign exchange effects, sales in the US were up 6% this quarter and within Europe, sales were up 3%. Sales within Japan remained somewhat soft and were down by 6% and sales in Asia outside of Japan remained strong and were up 22%.", "Turning to the product front, within the Waters division, Instrument systems grew by 3% against a very strong base of comparison. Our service business grew by 11% and chemistry had 11% growth as well. Our TA Instruments division had another strong quarter with sales up 15% versus prior year, resulting from strong new product sales.", "Now I would like to comment on non-GAAP margins and expenses, excluding the items noted in this morning's press release. Gross margin remained strong this quarter and came in at 58.2%. Versus prior year, margins expanded by about 140 basis points. We continue to benefit from product cost reductions, favorable product mix and currency translation. SG&A expenses grew by about 10% this quarter compared to prior year, and were heavily influenced by currency translation.", "R& D expenses grew by 16% as new product introduction costs raised our spending somewhat this quarter. We currently expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 17.5%. To adjust year-to-date taxes within the second quarter, our Q2 tax rate is 16.9%. The decline in our full year effective rate is principally the result of the capitalized software adjustment I previously described. On the stock buyback front, we continue to repurchase our shares in the open market, and during the second quarter we purchased 1.25 million shares of our common stock for $77.6 million. Fully diluted average share count was 101 million shares for the quarter.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $831 million, and debt totaled $984 million, bringing us to a net debt position of about $153 million.", "We measure free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any non-cash tax benefit from FAS 123R accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. For the quarter, free cash flow was $89 million after funding $18 million of CapEx. Comparable free cash flow in Q2 last year was $91 million, and for the first half of 2008 our free cash flow is up 12%.", "Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, equal to Q1 last year. And without currency effects, DSO improved by about three days versus prior year.", "Inventories increased about $10 million this quarter with currency translation comprising $3 million of the increase.", "Now, I would like to turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2008. Our second quarter sales results were in line with our prior expectations, and we believe the current business conditions remain comparable to those we assessed last quarter. Therefore, we continue to believe that we will be able to deliver sales growth in the range of 6% to 8% before currency effects. Currency at today's levels should add about 5% to growth this year bringing our overall growth to 11% to 13%.", "Moving down to P&L; for the full year, we expect gross margins to improve by about 120 basis points, as a result of improved production efficiencies on higher production volumes, favorable mass spec sales mix, product cost reductions and continued favorable foreign currency translation effects.", "Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate above/equal to sales. We will moderate our spending on additional resources to keep our expense growth aligned with actual sales volumes. We expect our tax rate to be about 17.5% for the remainder of 2008, incorporating a lower tax rate on capitalized software costs.", "Net interest expense is expected to be in the neighborhood of $20 million.", "And our fully diluted average shares outstanding are currently estimated to be about 101 million shares for the full year.", "Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35 per share, where sales growth is between 11% and 13%. For Q3 we expect sales growth of 11% to 12%. Gross margins should continue to see significant improvements versus prior year. And operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate comparable to sales.", "Earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be between $0.73 and $0.77 for the third quarter. Doug.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John. And operator, I think at this point we could open it up for Q&A.", "QUESTION AND ANSWER", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on a good quarter.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "I wanted to talk about the developing market, specifically China. There was a recent GDP report that was slightly below trend over the last several quarters. And you guys obviously had really nice growth this quarter, 20% plus. Are you seeing any sort of slacking of demand there and where would you characterize the different pockets of strength or weakness within that market?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Russ, we're seeing -- I'd say we've seeing remarkably consistent demand from China for a while now. In the second quarter, there was remarkably no change from the last several quarters. Actually, in China, I'd say it's a pretty balanced mix across our typical applications, including pharmaceutical.", "But I would say the strongest areas continue to be in what we classify as industrial applications, environmental, food and beverage are particularly strong, and food and beverage, it's both in quality evaluation and in regulated export type of applications.", "A lot of soft drink applications growing in ample, Southeast Asia marketplace, so I'd say it's -- and that's what we've seen consistently. I'd say it didn't particularly move in the most recent quarter.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And, you know, as we look to the consumable piece of the business, you saw a nice rebound off of Q1 levels. Can you talk about sort of the differential there? Was there any impact from more selling days in the quarter or was that just purely sort of demand related making up for some of the weakness we saw in Q1?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We think that the weakness that we saw in the first quarter was largely due to calendar items, the timing of Easter and the way the yearend fell versus the way the first quarter ended, losing a couple of selling days on top of Easter. It might have been just a smidge of formal weakness that creeps in there, but by far we thought it was calendar items.", "And, in fact, the second quarter largely returned to our traditional low double-digit growth rates across those product lines. So we're pretty confident that the first quarter was the anomaly and that our business in that area is pretty predictable going forward at this current rate.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thanks, guys, I'll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Hi. Good morning. Congratulations on nice quarter as well.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Quintin.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "With respect to the European, I guess return to spending from some of your big pharmaceutical customers, did you see just a gradual increase or did you see kind of a make up from Q1 and Q2? And can you talk a little bit about, you know, do you see -- is it drug discovery, is it moving to CROs or any kind of color on that return?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I wouldn't have you believe that Europe is all that different from what we're experiencing across the pharmaceutical marketplace. We did see -- because we saw some specific orders that we thought were delayed in the first quarter. We did pick those up in the second quarter, so that, you know, helps us believe that our sales intelligence is working. But overall, I'd say the Euro phrama market is pretty consistent with the US pharma market and that's very cautious.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "And then, with respect to gross margin, I think that as input prices -- input costs seem to be going up, like steel, copper, resin costs, you've been able to still, in fact, if anything, increase your gross margin expansion expectations.", "So tell us a little bit about how you are dealing with the cost of the input prices for you and what is the pricing environment for your products to be able to pass that through to your customers? If you need to.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a very fair question. I would say we're seeing some pockets of strength in producer pricing and, you know, certainly in the freight area, anything that requires fuel, we're certainly hearing rumblings and we've seen some real increases. In some areas, where we deal with some reasonably rare metals in our products, we're seeing some movement to higher pricing.", "But it represents a relatively small part of the overall inputs to our product line. And I would say what you're seeing is the continual focus on driving improved processes to the ACUITY product line, to a lesser extent on a number of our other product lines.", "But also the fact that as our new mass spec products come online, they're inherently better margins and as they take up a better overall level of the sales volume, that's what here John referred to as product mix, a lot of that is happening in our product line as these. As we drive efficiency through the plants, we're getting just a better, you know, gross margin mix of the existing sales volume.", "So that's -- we've been talking about that with ACUITY. We continue to focus on it, that when we introduced it, it's at a high point in its cost structure and we continuously move that along and that's really what you're seeing, combined with some benefit from the foreign exchange -- you know, the weakness in the dollar.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird.", "Thank you for that. And then last question and I'll jump back in the queue, for the second half of this year, your tax rate assumption, so should we just assume kind of that 18.5 or 18.6 range?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "No. As we go through the second half, we're currently expecting about a 17.5% rate, Quintin. And that incorporates the going forward effect of the cap software. So that's offset by a slightly higher cost of sale associated with higher amortization costs, the FX piece of the amortization costs. So 17.5% rate for us now is the rate we expect to see for the future.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird.", "I see, so what we saw here in this quarter continues on for the next couple of quarters, then?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, yes.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird.", "Okay. And then when does that anniversary, then, Q1 of next year?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Well I mean next year we'll have to reassess again what the rate will be just given the mix of income across legal entities. But until the situation changes with cap software and perhaps there's a different mix of how much is being capitalized versus amortized, the 17.5% rate is likely to stay at least for the next couple of quarters or perhaps a longer.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. As we look at next year for that the effect of cap software in and of itself, we don't think that's going to be a significant dynamic in moving that 17.5% tax rate.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, if everything works out in our plan, and you know, tax rates are not the easiest thing as we're seeing to forecast, all other things being equal, we'd expect it to be around the 17.5% next year, also.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "That's right.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Good morning.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "In a seemingly tough raw material environment, you increased your expected year-over-year full year gross margin improvement from 100 basis points to 120 basis points. You pointed to mass spec as one driver to why you expect the gross margins to improve year-over-year. Does this imply anything about changes in end market dynamics or your market share expectations for the full year?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, not really. I mean, you know, we think it's a tough marketplace out there and we think we've got new -- good new products, so I wouldn't shy away from saying we think we are doing better than many others in the marketplace. But I think the margin dynamics just are kind of as we explained it, foreign exchange is better, the efficiencies in our existing product lines are better.", "And as we've introduced in the mass spec area, you know, with the new products came in with a better cost configuration than the old products and we didn't have to trade down on price, so we just have the better gross margin dynamic as they take up a bigger share of our mass spec volume. So that's really what's happening there.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "And as Doug explained earlier, you know, the impact of commodity pricing really hasn't come through in our cost of sales in a big way. So I'm certain in other environments or other companies that is much larger issue, but for us, it's just isn't right now.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The reason, how that affects our business is to factor in why we are cautious in getting more exuberant about the potentials to grow faster, we think the cost dynamics may affect our customers a little bit more than they affect us, and that's why we continue to look a little more cautiously at our top line growth, but we don't think it's going to have a material impact. It does have an impact, you know, we do have a lot of travel costs, our sales force travels and so we've factored that into our budget estimates, but we think it's in there at a reasonable level.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay, that is helpful. And then maybe another guidance question. Could I just confirm that there were no changes in your year-over-year expectations for pharma demand incorporated in to your new guidance? And as a follow up to that, keeping in mind the recent announcements from Roche-Genentech to have a bar, can you talk about how consolidation in big pharma and biotech may impact demand and pricing moving forward?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think in general the level of potential consolidation going on in big pharma isn't as material as it was, you know, when Pfizer bought Pharmacia or Warner Lambert or when Glaxo bought Wellcome and others. So I think the level that we're looking about well, could influence those companies in their\u2026their investments. You know Roche owned half of Genentech anyway. I don't think it's likely to have a huge impact there.", "So, you know, overall, I'm not feeling all that bad about what's likely to happen on that score, but we're forecasting the second half to be conditions along the lines of what we're seeing now. We're not expecting a robust improvement in the pharmaceutical world.", "I would tell you that some of the pharmaceutical accounts are talking about a better second half, but they have delayed investments and that they think they'll be investing in the second half. I can also tell you we're not taking a significant amount of that to the bank in our forecast. So if it happens, I think we'll benefit from it, but it's\u2026 I think it's still a tough environment for those larger pharmaceutical accounts.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Great. And if I could just ask one more question and then I'll get back in the queue. You talked about strong indications in terms of demand for Xevo. Could you share anything in terms of which end markets have been\u2026 in which end markets were you seeing the strongest interest?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Interestingly enough, as you probably know, our market share in the Quantitative Bioanalysis segment isn't that great, hasn't been for the last, five or six years for a number of reasons. Some restructuring on the part of some competitors. I think a lot of those traditional accounts have started looking at alternate suppliers.", "So we're seeing a great deal of interest in some of those traditional pharmaceutical markets, about Xevo in particular, and I think, you know, some of it's just being careful on their part, and I won't say that we are seeing a lot of that manifest itself in real business yet, but it's an encouraging sign.", "Sailing [ph] that its Xevo basically now operates\u2026 incorporates some significant qualitative features into what traditionally has been a more quantitative set of customer applications. We're seeing interest in the academic world, in the governmental world, as well as in our classical applied markets in food and beverage and environmental.", "So it's encouraging, but I think it will be another couple of quarters before we can really point to tangible business that I can report, yeah, we think we've taken some share here.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Great. Well, thanks again for taking all the questions.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just actually asking Doug's earlier question in another way on the competitive front, are you seeing anything meaningful in terms of share shift, in terms of, you know, competitive bid activity picking up or anything out of the ordinary?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You mean specifically in pharma or --", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Yes. Both pharma and academics, so\u2026", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would not say anything on the competitive front, Tycho, that's of real note. I would say just in the pharma world, as I said, we're seeing customers that say they want and need instrumentation, but they have delayed. I can say in one or two cases as we've gone into the third quarter, early on we've seen some of that business fall in.", "But I wouldn't say that it's\u2026 it reflects a big difference in what those accounts are doing competitively or they're looking for more quotes. My anecdotes on the triple quad side are just that, anecdotes and, as I say, I think we'll have to see that play out over the next six months.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then with regards to the carry over from last quarter, you had some orders that got pushed through and then the Easter impact, could you just quantify the impact of what that was and then also, the margin contribution this quarter from FX mix and cost reduction.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think the calendar effect was largely on our consumables and service side of the business, and that\u2026 all in that business went from about 7%, I think, growth in the first quarter to low double-digits in the second quarter. So\u2026and low double digits is what we always kind of expect out of that business because it's very reliable and predictable, and so we thought 2 to 3 points kind of was the effect on that consumables business in the first quarter.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Yeah.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's much tougher call. We intuitively thought there was some effect on the Instrument side, but not as quantifiable and it's a lumpier consideration. In terms of the\u2026", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "The margin contributions, and just the relative impact of FX and cost reduction.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "FX was --", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "About a half.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Better than half, just better than half in the quarter. Currency was a little better than I thought it would be, versus the initial expectations, so we ended up with a bit more of an impact from FX this time around and then the cost reductions in the mix are probably about equally weighted, you know, maybe 20%, 25% each, something like that.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then you had at PITTCON introduced something for the QA, QC market with the patrol [ph]. Are you still kind of thinking that's a longer term, couple of year ramp there, are you seeing anything from a regulatory standpoint?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we actually didn't budget for\u2026 anything meaningful this year. We're still working with thought-mirror [ph] accounts to really work on the sampling end of it and making sure that we can reliably in a rugged environment deliver the kind of performance that they need.", "So we didn't anticipate that was going to be a big dynamic this year. I would suggest probably into the second half of '09 when we'll really\u2026we are hopeful that we can bring that to a reliable ongoing source of revenue.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then finally, just for John, did you say the normalized tax rate was 16.9% in the quarter?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "No, the run rate tax -- the tax rate going forward that we should use is 17.5%.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "16.9, takes into account the impact of adjusting the year-to-date rates within the quarter, so for the second half of the year, 17.5 is what we're expecting.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. So what was the normalized tax rate, then, for the quarter?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "17.5.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "17.5, okay.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Because of the catch-up, because the first quarter's rate was 18.6 and we want to bring the year-to-date to 17.5. We had to bring the rate down in the quarter to 16.9. Okay. So 17.5 is the rate we should think about for 2008.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you very much.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Derik deBruin with UBS.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Hi, good morning.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "You know, your TA business has just continued to just outperform beyond all expectations. You know, and you've done -- you've tucked in some nice acquisitions in there and done like that. I guess  -- talk a little bit more about that market and other acquisition opportunities out there and, I guess, was the 21% -- I mean was there any acquisition in the number this quarter?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "15%. The growth rate for TA we said was 15%.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Okay.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "And there is probably a couple of points, maybe, of rollover M&A in there, it's rather small.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "But then for the overall business, it's like 13.5% for the overall business?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, yes. Absolutely.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Okay. What other opportunities are there out there in the TA markets?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "There are a number of opportunities. I would characterize them. They're not huge sales revenue acquisition opportunities. They tend to be on the smaller side. There are some that are maybe in the 40 to $50 million revenue side, but I wouldn't say we have many of those targeted right now.", "There are a lot of applications that surround these industrial markets that are available for augmenting our current product line. So, you know, this is one area where I think on average doing one or two things a year is imminently doable.", "They'll tend to be on the smaller side. That's the -- but they keep this business, I think, predictable double-digit grower over the long term. If you just look at the product lines and the applications that it's serving, this business continues to bring new products, particularly the new rheometer product. It's a leader in the marketplace and a lot of natural growth just from upgrading the installed base that hasn't seen a new instrument here in a while. So I think the next two, three quarters are very predictable from the source of growth that is driving the business today.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Okay. You've done about -- your growth margin is up 120 basis points this year. How much more room is there when you start looking out at 2009? I mean is there another 100 points variance there over the next couple of years?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't if I would quote a 100 basis points. I'm little too conservative I think to predict anything of that nature. I mean obviously we've had the benefit of foreign exchange. We're going to anniversary that. You could argue next year, so it's unlikely that you're going to see the improvement again associated with foreign exchange.", "But on the other hand, I would say that on the product cost side, you know, we continue to identify opportunities for cost reduction on the ACUITY product, some of which you've seen, some of which is still in the works. We've recently transferred a couple of our HPLC detectors to Singapore, they're ramping up. So, we're going to see some cost reductions from those.", "So I'd say from the normal course of business, outside of foreign exchange, you know, that 10, 20 basis points of improvement that we generally look for every year, I'd say looks very positive, given the opportunities that we have on the cost reduction side.", "And I do think, as we look at the chemistry business going forward, to the extent that the installed base of ACUITY continues to grow, we're likely to see that being beneficial to our growth rate on the chemistry products, which will likewise improve margins. So I think, a little bit of that mix will continue.", "The product cost reductions look good for the next couple of years. I don't think that translates perhaps -- you know, maybe we're talking 40, 50 basis points, it's not going to be 100 basis points and then currency is anyone's guess I'd say at this stage.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "That's helpful. I guess in the -- you know, where have you seen your biggest pockets of growth from, in Asia? Has it been mostly the industrial, chemical, from that standpoint?", "And is that across \u2013 and then between TA business, let's just talk about the Waters specific business. Where has been the greatest market growth is coming from in that market?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if you look at region, our countries, outside of Japan, we've seen strength almost everywhere. And it's somewhat geographical. If you look at the smaller markets like Thailand, Vietnam, we're certainly seeing a lot of food analysis business there.", "If you look at Korea, you know, we see a lot of industrial applications, but also a good mix of pharmaceutical. China, as I said before, is a very balanced mix across pharmaceutical applications, food and beverage, governmental labs.", "So I'd say, you know, China is kind of across all the fronts and that's the biggest marketplace for us in Asia. India is principally pharmaceutical and that continues -- that pharmaceutical market continues to grow, a good double-digit basis. So I'd say India is the most homogenous of all of our markets.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Some people have raised some questions about does China slow after the Olympics and how cyclical is the food safety analysis as people get worried about food prices and things like that, have you heard anything to suggest that those markets could potentially slow?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "First thing is, I don't think any of our business has been affected really on the upside from the Olympics. So it's not like we've got a big bolus of business that's coming in for that, other than maybe some environmental testing in general, you might say is influenced by, you know, the Chinese wanting to clean up their environment.", "But most of what we're seeing is much more infrastructure, has more of a long-term feel to it. We don't -- if anything, I think we think the food safety opportunity in China is much bigger. We think the soft drink analysis and testing market is bigger, both in China and throughout that area.", "So, you know, it's -- you can't ever tell in these somewhat command economies what the command will decide to do, but I think it's going to be awfully hard to radically change the path that they're on in a lot of these applications. We get no sense that they're tapping out, certainly not in the next couple of quarters. And I wouldn't say we're seeing any advance signs of it.", "So your guess and others' are as good as ours in terms of what the '09, '10 pretends, but I think it's going to be tough for them to move out of this cycle that they're in.", "Derik deBruin - UBS", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Isaac Ro with Leerink Swann.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, sorry about that. Real quick on new product introductions, such as Xevo and TRIZAIC. Can you talk a little bit about how customer evaluation times might be changing relative to the total capital spending environment you mentioned?", "And then secondly on those products, how do you think margins compare on those systems relative to your corporate average for instrumentation?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The margins will be -- will not negatively influence\u2026", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "About average at the introduction. Yeah. With longer term opportunity to improve.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's right. I'd say in the evaluation side, it's bimodal. In applied markets, it's -- we don't think -- again, we're early on in the introduction. We don't think it's going to be particularly long, because what we're really offering is a new capability with the qualitative capability in Xevo.", "In the Quantitative Bioanalysis market, I think that's likely to be a more traditional evaluation process. So that's one reason why I was saying it's going to be another six months before we probably have a good feeling in that marketplace, how this is going to shape up in terms of market share.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Okay, great. And then just taking another look at maybe lateral impacts of M&A and the drug industry, can you maybe talk about how your business with CROs has increased either as a percentage of your total customer base or on an absolute basis in recent years? For example are you doing more business with a measurably larger number of CROs today or just doing more business with the same larger players in that market?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'd say in general in the western world, our business with CROs has been the strongest part of our pharmaceutical industry or one of the strongest; generics have been very strong too. And for the most part those CROs have been the same names that you would have recognized five years ago, they've just been growing much faster and they've been investing in instrumentation much faster.", "The place where we've seen new\u2026and some of it's, you know, just different corporate names, is in Eastern Europe and in India where you're seeing new CROs come on the scene and new business opportunities there. We don't disclose particularly what those CROs grow, but your assumption is correct, it's been growing in the double digits consistently and it's been a strong part of the pharma business.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Great, and lastly on\u2026just in the first quarter call, I think you mentioned a major pharma customer that delayed or having a specially delayed capital spending cycle in the first quarter. Can you see whether or not that customer or if it was a group of them had snapped back in the quarter or at least normal\u2026", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'd say in specifics that was related to Europe, and we did as I said before, that business did come in. We're seeing similar kinds, you know, it's always a question of something moves out of the first into the second, so something move out of the second into the third?", "We've seeing perhaps even a little bit more of that kind of anecdote at the end of the second quarter and, in fact, we've seeing some of that business come in already in the third quarter.", "So we're kind of monitoring that very closely because it's possible that that business could turn a little bit more favorable than we think. But we're very cautious about taking one or two data points and thinking that this war is won.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "John Groberg with Merrill Lynch.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for taking the call. Congratulations on a very solid quarter. Can I ask John, I need a couple of clarification questions? What was your contribution from acquisitions? I know you had a Calorimetry acquisition, and then also what was the...", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "That added maybe a couple of percentage points to the 15% TA, without it might have been 13.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It is less than a point.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "It's well under a point for the full corporation.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And the FX impact of the bottom line. I know you talked about the gross margin impact, but can you quantify?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "It ends up being about a penny for every percent on the top line, so it's around a 6%ish bottom line impact for the quarter.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "$0.06, you mean?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then if I got the numbers right, you said US and local currency grew 6, Europe 3, Japan was down 6, and Asia was 22%. I think in Japan you had easier comps from the second quarter of '07 relative to the first quarter. Just curious.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "They get easier across the year. The second quarter was still a bit more difficult. I mean in constant currencies, Japan grew 8% in the second quarter; the minor 6 was pulling currency out. And then comps the get considerably easier in Q3 and Q4. Our expectation would be that Japan should flatten out to show some growth as we move through the second half.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "I'm sorry, so the numbers you gave were the negative were\u2026 the 6% included currency, then, and in local currency Japan grew 8%?", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Whenever I talk about regional growth, I talk about it stripping currency out, so --", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Because the Japanese currency\u2026", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "(inaudible) benefit of currency went down 6%, but, again, if you just looked at it in Yen, it would have been an 8% increase.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no. Let's make sure. In standard currency, in Yen.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "It was down 6%.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We thought [ph] 6%.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Because of the Yen strength.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Because you had the Yen strengthening, that raised the translated numbers to grow.", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "I am sorry, that's right.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So you were right John. So in real organic terms, Japan was not -- it wasn't down as much as it was in the first quarter.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And we think that's the trend. It will improve in the second half of the year.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "My overall question there on Japan was it looks like it's improving, but still kind of difficult, so I was trying to get an update on that.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we share that. We think the worst is behind us. We had some very tough comps coming into the year. You know, Japan pharma in particular, is not strong, but we're seeing the applied markets and the chemical analysis piece to be reasonably optimistic.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And what was your\u2026 you mentioned the growth. What's kind of your split now between the overall pharma, life science, everyone defines it and industrial chemical? Where do you see that kind of in your internal plans? Where do you see that being, you know, a few, three to five years from now? It sounds like you're really focusing on expanding that industrial chemical piece of your overall exposure.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's true, but pharma, broadly defined pharma is a trade class. It's still the largest piece of our business. So that represents all in about 60% of our worldwide revenue. But it is true that food and beverage, environmental and those applied industrial markets are growing faster today.", "You know, I'd still say we see real opportunities for good, solid growth in the pharmaceutical market, maybe not from, you know, the traditional largest pharmas, but including CROs, including the developing markets of eastern Europe and in Asia and in generic drug manufacturers, there's still\u2026 we grew that business in the first quarter.", "It was flattish in the second quarter, and we still see opportunities for real growth going forward, particularly there comes a point when a lot of these companies that have delayed and delayed and delayed have got to invest in more of their replacement products. So we think there will be pent up replacement in demand even in some of the accounts that are pretty weak right now.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "But for you guys, I mean historically I guess, I think it has been 75% life science, 25% more industrial. Is that\u2026 is that either via acquisition or where you're focusing growth? I know what you said, but do you anticipate that changes?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think you include the government academic when you get up to the 75% level.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Sure.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know, so the 60% I was talking about is just pharmaceutical. We're still at about that 75% level if you include government academic applications.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And my question was more just three to five years, either via acquisitions, where you focus your acquisitions or what's your --", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely, I think you can say that right now we see that industrial world, we see TA in specific kind of outgrowing our Waters business right now, and we're focusing our acquisition activity there, but it would just be wrong to think that that 75% is going to go to 45% or something like that. It -- on the fringe, industrial will probably grow faster in the next couple of years.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And you don't have some kind of, I don't know if you had an internal three to five-year target of what you'd like that mix to be, I guess, is kind of --", "John Ornell - Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer", "No. I'd like that pharmaceutical world to go back to double-digit growth.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then last question, you know, Doug, you defined this as one of the most difficult spending environments in some time, but you still put up a good quarter. I'm just curious, did the timing in the quarter play out differently than it has for you in the past? I know a lot of your sales come in kind of in the last three weeks to a month.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think, you know, materially so. I would say, you know, at some points in the quarter, like all quarters, it looked like it would be better and then maybe a few of those large accounts that have been talking about, you know, that we really thought were going to buy this quarter pushed out into the next quarter or two.", "So if you had talked to me at one point in the quarter, John, if I were willing to say anything to you, of course, I might have been a little bit more optimistic, but, you know, that happens to some extent in a lot of quarters, so I just think what we're seeing is that in the large\u2026 particularly large pharma accounts, you get one piece of that constituency saying we've got to spend, we've got to move these projects ahead and then as it comes time to actually spend the money, they get a little bit more cautious sometimes. We think that that could change, but it hasn't changed significantly at this point.", "John Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks a million.", "Operator", "Sir, at this time I show no questions.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, very good.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter 2009 financial results conference call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter financial results conference call. And with me on today's call is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "As is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarters' highlights and then John will follow with details on our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year, but before we get going, I would like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements, regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for Q2 and full year 2009.", "We caution you that all such statements are only predictions that actual events or results may differ materially. For detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, and Part I under the caption 'Business Risk Factors.' We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions.", "We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release, conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for July 2009. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning, and our discussion with the results of operations were being referred to pro forma results which exclude the effect of [findings] such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, 'Reconciliation Of Net Income Per Share', included in this morning's press release. ", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Okay. Thanks, John. Well, in the past couple of quarters, we have seen significant change in demand trends in our markets. Concerns about tightening capital markets were followed quickly by a souring global economy, compounding issues related to an already skittish pharmaceuticals spending environment. Certainly these turbulent times stress even the most successful business strategies, as slower demand and weaker visibility allow little flexibility for less than optimized business decision making.", "Though we have been through tough end markets before, none have matched the current environment, and I think thus our business model has been and is being subjected to a new test. I'm pleased to tell you that we are weathering this storm, and that in the first quarter, the agility and resiliency of our business has allowed us to deliver higher operating profits than earnings despite a top line that was under pressure.", "Our sales in the quarter were down 5% on a currency neutral basis, and we were able to deliver 7% earnings growth due to tight cost control, currency-related cost reductions, leverage from our share repurchase program, and favorable product and geographical mix. We benefited from investments in a global manufacturing and distribution strategy that allowed us in the quarter to more than offset the adverse top line effects of a stronger U.S. dollar with reduced British pound and Euro-based manufacturing and SG&A costs to yield a nice pickup in our margins.", "In addition, our global sales strategy that focuses on delivering innovative system-based solutions supports a market-leading pricing position that can be quarter after quarter seen in our superior gross margin. Looking at the top line, the strong performance of our recurring revenues, including our service and chromatography chemicals businesses help partially offset slower instrument sales. Over the years, our recurring revenue growth has remained fairly consistent and somewhat insensitive to the quarterly fluctuations we\u2019ve seen in instrument demand. That dynamic has benefited us during the past couple of quarters and we expect to see this trend continue through 2009.", "In the first quarter of 2009, the calendar treated our recurring revenues kindly, and we estimate that more selling days added about one to two points of growth to our corporate sales. Instrument revenue saw our mid-teen decline in the quarter, as demand from industrial chemical accounts and from some developing countries was particularly weak. We attribute the weakness in chemical spending to global recessionary pressures, while declines in our sales in India and Eastern Europe, seem due to a combination of economic factors and significantly weakened local currencies.", "Looking at our instrument system business more closely, demand for high-end and application-focused systems was stronger than for more routine analysis instruments that were often purchased to replace older systems. Customer interest was strongest for our new mass spectrometry and ACQUITY instruments. Looking at our end markets, pharmaceutical segment sales growth was inline with the company\u2019s overall performance, while weaker industrial sales were offset by stronger government and university spending.", "Among our larger pharmaceutical customers we saw some capital releases in the first quarter, while others are expected to begin spending later in the year. Overall, we enjoyed a slight growth that is a slight growth in large account spending in the quarter, compared with last year. So we feel that spending by large cap pharma remains relatively weak and that recent merger activity may inject more uncertainty in the capital spending plans. Our sales volumes to these accounts during the past two quarters suggest that business here is stabilizing.", "Geographically and within our more mature markets including Western Europe, North America and Japan, our currency neutral sales performance was balanced in the quarter, and declined at a mid-single digit grade. Currency neutral sales in the developing world finished with a similar growth rate, with growth in China offsetting weaknesses in India and smaller markets. Within China, sales to government agencies, universities and applied markets were strong.", "Weaker sales in India impacted our global pharmaceutical sales and the slower demand from firms there is largely associated with the rapid devaluation of the rupee and a strong-based quarter comparison. As we transact much of our business in India in US dollars, the weak rupee has resulted in customers having to delay orders while they re-budgeted to account for the higher dollar value to fund their capital purchases.", "Our TA Instruments division was affected by its high exposure to the chemicals and plastic industries. As you might expect, TA's core thermal product lines were pretty hard hit, as chemical suppliers to many consumer product manufacturers scaled back their spending.", "However, the division did see a nice pickup in service revenue and continued growth of new life science product lines. TA has significant new product introductions planned for later this year. However, despite TA's technological and market leading market positions, the next couple of quarters are likely to be challenging given the poor outlook for the global economy and the tough comparison to strong sales in 2008.", "Moving down to P&L, in the quarter, we carefully controlled our spending while targeting profitable business. While talk of steep discounting and price deflation seems to dominate the news these days, we have been able to maintain our pricing by focusing on the overall value proposition we offer our customers.", "We have found, in fact, that during these times of depressed capital budgets, customers appear more willing to purchase instrument systems that enhance their productivity and meaningfully enhance their research efforts than to settle for more generic capabilities at lower prices. [Within] Waters and recognizing the importance of continued technological leadership to our long-term business strategy we have maintained funding of our R&D program to insure timely delivery of new product introductions.", "Already this year, we had significant introductions at this year's Pittsburgh Conference. On the mass spec front, we showcased our Xevo platform and formerly introduced Xevo QTof and instruments that sets new standards for sensitivity and ease-of-use for high resolution accurate mass measurements. The Xevo QTof joins the Xevo TQ, tandem quadrupole system that we began shipping in 2008. Both instruments combine leading performance, ease-of-use and versatility in compact bench-top design.", "Customer acceptance of these new products has been very strong. This year's Pittsburgh Conference also marked the fifth anniversary of our ACQUITY UPLC system. It's hard to believe that five years in fact given the level of excitement that continues to surround ACQUITY UPLC technology and ACQUITY continues to transform the chromatography market.", "What's more exciting than looking back on what we have accomplished for ACQUITY is looking ahead toward where UPLC technology is going. At this point, it's clear to see that we have transformed the LC market and nearly all significant competitors are introducing systems that claim to leverage the performance advantages of sub-two micron particles. After five years and after many thousands of successful instrument placements, no competitor can offer the proven performance and application support that's only available from Waters.", "At this year's Pittsburgh Conference, we introduced new ACQUITY instrument configuration and also expanded UPLC column offerings. Our Trizaic, micro fluidic tile technology demonstrates the future direction for incorporating ACQUITY technology, within advanced mass spectrometry instruments while other [embodynance] of ACQUITY directed towards process control and quality assurance applications.", "In short, be assured that we continue to build on our ACQUITY success and plan for new and exciting innovations on this front in the quarters and years ahead. In the first quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Thar instruments, the world leader in supercritical fluid chromatography or SFC. SFC is a separation technology closely related to HPLC that primarily uses carbon dioxide as the mobile phase.", "SFC can be used to purify, as well as analyze a wide array of compounds that are soluble in carbon dioxide and can be interfaced with mass spectrometry. We were attracted to SFC due to its similarity to HPLC, it\u2019s compatibility with mass spectrometry and because the technique is environmentally friendly. As we have found with the drastic reduction in solvent usage with our ACQUITY system, our customers are increasingly concerned with the cost and environmental impact of the reagents that they are using in their experiments. ", "Thar technology allows us to highlight our partnership with our customers on this green chemistry trend. In all, Thar represents the type of company that Waters is targeting on the M&A front. And that it's close to us technologically, very profitable and has top line growth potential to be accretive to our overall growth rate. During the quarter, our Board approved another $500 million stock repurchase plan and we continue to deploy our cash flow towards share repurchases in the quarter.", "Before I turn you over to John for a deeper look at our financials, I would like to say a few words about our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'm cautiously optimistic; emphasize 'cautious' about the second half of the year. Some day we may look and determine that the past two quarters were the most difficult for us in this recessionary period. However, what is certain is that we are in uncertain times.", "I am, however, encouraged by the potential for our new products in combination with higher research spending associated with various stimulus plans around the world. Already we have seen a significant pick up in quotation activity associated with plans in the United States. Most of the interest is for research mass spectrometry and ACQUITY UPLC. At this year's ASMS meeting in June, we are planning significant new product introductions that we feel will help attract additional stimulus spending in our direction.", "Finally, as we move into the second half of the year, we will have less difficult prior year comparisons as we begin to see tighter money and the weaker economy adversely affect our business in late 2008. Though quarterly demand for our markets may improve later this year, let me assure you that we will remain cautious and continue to manage our costs carefully.", "While many of the factors that have pressured our markets are clearly outside of our control, we will continue to do our best to manage our business to optimize our profitability and insure Waters long-term competitiveness. Thank you very much. Now I will turn it over to John.", "John Ornell", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. First quarter sales declined by 10% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.74 this quarter compared to $0.69 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings was $0.75 this quarter compared to $0.67 this year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Reviewing Q1 sales results, sales were down 10% this quarter with currency translation representing 5% of this decline. Versus prior year, the first quarter had three more selling days than 2008, which we believe added between 1% and 2% to our overall sales growth this quarter.", "Looking at our sales growth, geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales declined pretty much as expected with all of our regions feeling the impact of the global recession. Sales within the U.S. were down 6%, European sales were down 3%. Sales within Japan were down 7%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan declined by 6%. Turning to the product front, within the Waters division, instrument systems sales declined by 16%, and recurring revenues grew by 9% this quarter. Within our TA instruments division, the sales declined by 6% versus prior year.", "Now, I would like to comment on our non-GAAP financial performance. Gross margin was very strong this quarter and came in at 61.7% and versus prior year, the margins expanded by 350 basis points. This improvement was heavily affected by a very favorable combination of foreign exchange dynamics this quarter.", "In Japan, where the yen strength of 10% versus the U.S. dollar; we had favorable translation of our Japanese sales and no offsetting local manufacturing costs. In the UK, we have significantly more production than local sales and the British pound depreciated by 25% versus the U.S. dollar, significantly improving overall gross margins.", "Additionally, we experienced favorable product mix. There is a higher proportion of our sales, came from chemistry and services at high incremental margins especially given the headcount cost controls in place. And finally, we started the year with favorable results in our manufacturing operations with savings from lower warranty costs, freight savings through the use of ocean transport. Favorable price variances from vendors, all largely offsetting unfavorable manufacturing [bullied variances].", "SG&A expenses declined 9% this quarter, compared to prior year, as a result of our actions to control expenses and currency translation effects. We took a strong position on expense control as we started the year, and plan to continue to hold back on discretionary spending in response to the depressed economic conditions we faced, and R&D expenses declined by 7% this quarter, as a result of currency translation effects. Income taxes came in on plan at about 18% this quarter.", "On a GAAP basis, our tax rate was reduced by the reversal of a $4.8 million tax provision relating to last year's legal entity restructuring, which based on recently addition to regulations is no longer required. On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $431 million and debt totaled $588 million, bringing to us a net debt position of about $157 million. On the stock buyback front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market; and during the first quarter, we purchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock, $64 million.", "We defined free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus a non-cash tax benefit for FAS 123(NYSE:R) accounting, excluding unusual items. For Q1, free cash flow was $64 million after funding $22 million of CapEx, and excluding $6 million litigation fee. Capital expenditures will be lower later in the year as we complete construction of our new TA facility in Delaware by mid-year. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 76 days this quarter, and bettered the Q1 last year by resulting from favorable foreign currency translation. Inventories were $18 million, from year-end, as is typical at this point in the year.", "Before I update our guidance for 2009, let me put our forecast in perspective. This is the results we just delivered. The difficult economic conditions we faced in Q1 are expected to persist throughout the year. We plan to continue to hold back wherever possible on discretionary spending, but doing so could prove more difficult as the year goes on, so I expect some additional spending will be required in the second half of the year.", "Current foreign exchange environment could continue to provide improved gross margins on reduced sales, by and large; we discounted that in this guidance, given the unusual currency movements that produced that in our first quarter result. I believe the cautious posture is warranted, given the economic backdrop we face and [baking] a continuation of all of [our few unfavorabilities] into our full year guidance, this early in the year was not prudent. So for 2009, we believe our recurring revenues will continue to provide a level of stability in our business and are likely to grow at mid-single digit rates during the year. ", "Instrument demand is expected to be down mid-single to low-double digits for the full year. Overall, we are expecting sales to be down, between down 4% and up 1% before currency effects. Foreign exchange translation will reduce 2009 sales growth by about 4% at current rates. Therefore, on a reported basis, we are expecting sales to decline by between 3% and 8% for the full year 2009.", "Moving down to P&L, we expect gross margins to be up 2008 as a result of the factors I described earlier. Currency translation benefits have been discounted, as I said earlier, and product mix will become less favorable as instrument sales volume [decreases]. For the full year, we now expect to see a margin improvement of around 150 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to decline at a rate above or equal to sales.", "We expect our operating tax rate to be in the neighborhood of 18%, and net interest expense is expected to be in the neighborhood of $13 million. And our fully diluted average outstanding share count for the full year 2009 is currently estimated to be about 96 million shares. Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share to be in the range of $2.95 and $3.30 per share with sales declining between 3% and 8%.", "For Q2, we expect our currency neutral sales to again decline at a rate near to the bottom of our 2009 full-year sales range, and as a result of the difficult economic conditions, and a difficult base comparison versus Q2 last year. And the current exchange rates, currency translation will reduce sales growth by about 5%. Considering the factors, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter are expected to be between $0.75 and $0.79.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Operator, I think we can now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "A couple of things; first one, can you kind of walk through in more detail what happened on the gross margin side in terms of how we netted the improvement that we saw in terms of headwinds on volume, how much was FX? And how much was cost control?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure. If we look at the margin impact, FX was the biggest player of this quarter. If we look at the yen, the yen was up about 10% on a year-over-year basis, and that probably provided around us $3 million sales pickup with no corresponding increase in cost of sales. We have no manufacturing ops there. The British pound was down 25% versus the dollar, so our cost of sales was higher. And mass spec products did very well in the quarter.", "It was depressed and that probably added another $3 million to $4 million of net benefit to the gross margins. And then just the mix of high-end mass spec chemistry sales versus U.S. dollar cost production, which was proportionately lower, I added a little bit more to that as well. So, you know, above that somewhere between 75% and 80%, perhaps of the overall benefit, so it is associated with these dynamics in currency mix that I'm describing. In addition to that, product mix was favorable. As I had said, we have a different proportion this quarter of chemistry, services. ", "There weren't a lot of costs added to those operations for the incremental margin is pretty rich, and we had some savings within the manufacturing ops world as well, there were a couple of engineering cost reductions that went into place. We had lower freight costs. We switched some of our shipments to ocean freight. We had lower warranty costs, all of which tended to offset the volume of currencies that we otherwise would have seen. In addition to all of that, we had incredibly stable pricing around the world. So while I was a little fearful [whether we on would] see some pressure on the price side, that did not materialize in the quarter whatsoever.", "John Ornell", "And Marshall, I just might add that 30,000-foot perspective on this currency issue. I think one of the dynamics of the Waters, the way we run our business is over the last 15 years we have added most of our incremental manufacturing capacity outside the United States. So we're manufacturing in local currencies.", "In Ireland, it's somewhat in the Far East, and importantly in Manchester with our mass spec product line. What that means is that in those years when the dollar was quite weak, we had a lot of manufacturing costs. So you didn't see our bottom line being that much favorably impacted by a weak dollar. Now when you got a period of a strong dollar, we have these natural hedges built into the way we run our business that provide, in this case, surprisingly greater upside because of the way the pound moved versus everything else. ", "But it's fundamentally related to our long-term notion that we want to balance our manufacturing and our sales to a much greater degree than I think most companies in our position are able to do, and besides that we get the net result of substantial tax advantages by doing that too. So it's all a result of that strategy that you are seeing some of the benefits come through in this P&L.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Absolutely, that makes sense. Just a couple other things on the top line. So the consumables at 9%, was there anything special this quarter or anything kind of that pushed that number a little bit above expectations?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I think the only thing special versus what I\u2019d call a normal quarter is that we had a few more selling days in the first quarter of '09 versus '08. And that affects, to some degree, our service revenue, because you got more days for service guys to bill their time. It's a little hard to see how many of those flow through depending on Easter one year to the next year. That's why we think overall, that dynamic affected us one to two points in our growth rate.  But other than that there was nothing unusual in our recurring revenue dynamic.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great, and then just one other question on the selling days issue. The quarter ended April 4th, so was that just how the calendar fell for you? And then are we going to sort of give back those three days next quarter or how is that going to work? Did you guys decide to close it on the 4th?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes.", "John Ornell", "Yes. When you have the year starting on a Thursday like this, you got to make a call as to how many full weeks you\u2019re going to put in the quarter, and then we have 13-week quarters in Q2 and 3. And then whatever you\u2019ve done to yourself in the first quarter falls out in the fourth. So these days that we picked up in the first quarter will fall out in the fourth quarter.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "But, Marshall, it is consistent with how we\u2019ve done it over 15 years.", "John Ornell", "Way the calendar falls.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The way the calendar falls this year and next year it will be a little more consistent.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thanks, Marshall.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "So I'm trying to get a sense for kind of the optimism about the second half pickup. When you look at the commentary at a pharma, and that's big pharma, small pharma. Aside from the obvious on the M&A front, you are hearing a lot about portfolio rationalization taking down R&D spend significantly, headcount significantly, based on poor return on capital. I'm trying to rationalize that versus some of the comments about stabilization.", "We\u2019re seeing obviously some pretty big instability in the CROs in their result, which obviously is part of that pharma customer base, so I'm kind of curious on your assumptions there. It seems like you think that that's going to be stable through the year. And then on the industrial and chemical side, are we assuming kind of the flat lines from Q1 levels or are we assuming some pickup in the back half of the year, in some of those traditional industrial markets?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Okay. That's a lot to pack in, but I\u2019ll try to handle it, and John can [comment] on the other side. First of all, on the big pharma side, Ross, our results were actually pretty stable. Our big pharma customers actually grew this quarter, and that's the dynamic that we saw in the fourth quarter too. So if you look at the top 20 large pharmas around the world, actually there we saw most of their rationalization of their business happen prior to that period.", "Now, I won't tell you that it's all behind us, but one of our dynamics is we've been so intense in those accounts that we saw a factor of that really early on. The other thing is those accounts have been really focusing on productivity, and how to really drive their important processes faster and more importantly.", "And we\u2019ve actually seen a lot of success in our new capabilities in all facets, ACQUITY, mass spectrometry, and data; and making penetration into those accounts, so we\u2019re not anticipating that that drives up dramatically over the rest of the year, but we\u2019re not seeing the kind of pressure that maybe some others are seeing in some of those applications. ", "Secondly, we believe that there will be a stimulus impact in the rest of the year. It probably isn\u2019t second quarter; it's a second half dynamic. We\u2019ve certainly seen stimulus programs passed by the U.S., by China, by Brazil; it's really Western Europe that\u2019s probably seen almost nothing on the stimulus front coming from. So we haven't banked a lot of stimulus money into our outlook, but if you want to look at a reason to be a little more optimistic, I think the stimulus spending will provide some [H-factor] in what we are looking at.", "CROs clearly have been under pressure. They are under significant pressure in India and these results show negative results from CROs. But once again, our discussions with CROs say that where they are going to spend is going to be on the high productivity, high throughput range, where we think we have very competitive systems. So all in the question of whether the combination of CROs and pharmaceutical is going to go dramatically down from where they are now.", "I think if we are not at the bottom, we don't think that there is a whole, hell of a lot of room to drive that capital spend down much further. If you look at the developing areas that were very soft in the first quarter, you're talking about areas like Poland, Czech Republic, India; where they had pretty dramatic currency dynamics even more so than the Euros zone or other areas of world.", "We saw demand be dramatically affected as a result of that, and our discussions, our most recent discussions is that those accounts and those economies are working their way through how to create money available to support their business plans, particularly in India.", "The underlying volume in those generic pharmas in India is up like 25% or 30% in the past quarter. But their results are dramatically affected by liabilities that are non-rupee denominated and currency dynamics that they have to move through. But if you look at 30% to 35% demand increases there, somehow they\u2019ve got to fund the capabilities of increasing their output, and we feel like over the next several quarters, we'll see a more normalization of the demand in those quarters.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And just to be clear, Doug, when you talk about the impact of the stimulus, you are assuming this impacts both the industrial and the academic sides of your business or just (inaudible) UPLC into academic.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Principally Life Science and the academic in the government lab area.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Was there any, John, just quickly was there any impact from M&A in the quarter on the top line?", "", "John Ornell", "Yes, the acquisition of Thar added about $2 million or so of sales. It was probably a few hundred thousand of sales for the TA as well that were incremental year-over-year.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And going forward, Thar should be something like $4 million to $5 million a quarter?", "John Ornell", "Yes, something in that range.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "I mean, you said the annual was $20 million, right?", "John Ornell", "Yes. That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Could you give us a little update on the impact of the acetonitrile shortage? Are you seeing any impact in terms of maybe increased adoption or switching of compliance to ACQUITY?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Frankly, Quintin, I think if you gauge the amount of discussion on the part of our, particularly our significant customers, the answer is, it's definitely got their attention. Frankly, if you ask me to point to actual orders that are coming in as a result of it, it's a little harder. I think that this is still a building momentum that we've seen some impact of customers, but I don't think we've seen the real impact that's still to come.", "There's no reason to believe that the acetonitrile shortage is going to be impacted anytime soon, it's affected by a dynamics outside the laboratory industry as you know, acetonitrile is a byproduct of acrylonitrile production, and that\u2019s dramatically affected by industrial demands. And so the cost of acetonitrile is up significantly. That's probably still only being significantly felt by a number of these customers as we speak, and I expect it to have a significant impact, but I don't think I can say that it's significantly affected our current order run rate.", "", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "That's interesting. So then in this quarter, where you had really strong consumables and services, and I understand the service component with the extra dates, but on the consumable side and column usage then, it just sounds like that even with the shortage, even with the macroeconomy, your customers must be across board still doing day-to-day business.", " ", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think one of the things that perhaps isn't as well understood about our consumables business is it's not a catalog business that\u2019s full of relative, a mix of low value added items, and perhaps PH meters and things like that that are perhaps even more instrument kind of related. Particularly with ACQUITY, that's a much more captive stream. And of course, every ACQUITY instrument that we put into place increases that run rate of ACQUITY consumables.", "Now ACQUITY is still the smaller part of our overall chemistry consumables line, but it's a much faster growing piece. And together with the baseline of throughput in the QA/QC marketplace, requiring quality control of drug output, you know, we've never seen and didn't anticipate a dramatic fall-off in our chemistry sales.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Isaac Ro with Leerink Swann.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "First question will be just [felt] little bit on the stimulus money, and I\u2019m wondering maybe on a relative basis how you compare your exposure to stimulus dollars that are maybe in the healthcare segment, and then perhaps outside of healthcare sources. You know, so if not maybe on an absolute basis, I know that's a hard number to come across, but maybe relative.", "John Ornell", "I would just say that most of what we see in terms of quotes that we\u2019re actually making, which are substantial. In the product sense or in our highest value added systems, that\u2019s high-end mass spectrometry and ACQUITY-based systems and the great preponderance of them are what we call Life Science applications. They are in NIH-supported laboratories. They are in medical centers, hospital medical centers, and in government laboratories. That's where the preponderance interest is, I\u2019d say.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And then if we just look back historically just to take this one step further, I think for a lot of, just today, it looks like a lot of the grant applications for the NIH-related dollars are due now or thereabout. So if you just look back historically at government-funding, how would you parse it out between health care versus non-health care type applications?", "John Ornell", "The mix is heavily weighted towards life sciences, healthcare, if you will. Breaking it down any further than that within life science is difficult, but there is really [no way of] looking on the industrial side, if that's where you\u2019re headed.", "The only thing that I\u2019d say which is an interesting fact, I think most of this stimulus money, almost all of it is going to go to support existing investigators, that funding new investigators with [new] NIH grants, in the area of life sciences is not where it's targeting. If you don't have an existing approved investigator, existing grant that you\u2019re looking to augment, my guess is you are not going to get much stimulus money.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And then just on customer exposure, you mentioned before top 20 accounts, without getting too specific, could you give us a sense of how those top 20 accounts might be broken up between branded versus generic drug companies and then maybe CROs.", "John Ornell", "Almost all branded ethical pharmaceuticals.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And then just lastly thinking about the pharma, M&A outlook, I know it's a lot of moving parts here. But just if you can remind us how that marketplace impacted equipment sales, not chemistry but specific equipment, in the '02 and '03 timeframe as just sort of a reference point relative to what we might see this time of around.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Well, I think what we have seen historically is that, two large pharmas come together there is normally a quarter or two of reduced, if you looked at the two independently versus the two combined, there's a couple of quarters of reduced instrument purchases historically that then moves through and you see the line returning to a more historical level of growth, if they hadn't combined to start with.", "It's not clear. I mean, you\u2019ve got so many other dynamics that are entering the picture now with much more generic competition, much more cost control on the part of these companies. The fact that they are coming off five years of independent cost controls in a lot of the areas, I think the interesting part is in the quarter just completed, with some fairly major kind of consolidation activities underway; those major accounts grew in the mid-single digits. So, you know, as I said, I think the significant depressed conditions in big pharma have been apparent for a while.", "We\u2019ve come through two quarters now where our actual demand from those accounts grew. So I don't think that there is a whole lot of room for major downsides.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And then just lastly looking at your earnings guidance, you know, you obviously put up a good number this quarter and then next quarter is above the street. If you just kind of take the back half of the year and assume earnings are flat year-over-year, it would tell me, it would suggest to me at least that your guidance looks pretty conservative. So I mean, without putting words into your mouth, can you say whether or not you feel pretty confident that your full-year guidance is pretty achievable, given all the uncertainty you mentioned?", "John Ornell", "Yes. I guess, I would say that all of the difficulties that we talked about in forecasting coming out of the fourth quarter, moving into the first quarter and as we sit here today, you know, life isn't dramatically clearer. Yes, there's some reason for optimism, based on stimulus money and perhaps a few other factors, but I would say it's unclear exactly when we\u2019re going to pull out of this, so I just want to be as conservative as I can, as we are living through difficult times and as we always do, we hope we have more up side than down in the numbers that we put out there, but I think we have a realistic forecast that we are going to stick by.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Derik De Bruin with UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Can you talk a little bit about the capital budget releases of your customers and, just I'm trying to get a sense of the money going for new instrumentation, placement, and I\u2019m ultimately trying to get here is how much of your equipment business is replacement and then if you kind of look at the big pharma mergers that have happened, I guess, were these all big Waters account as a percent of this is going to be a surplus of instruments once the deals were closed and then even going to be potentially be a little longer in getting the stuff through the system than you would have expected?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I guess the best way for me to answer it is to put it in the context of the period that I have seen that's been most like this, which would have been the early '90s. And in that period you had some pharmaceutical mergers. You had a great deal of concern about government policies.", "You had pressure on margins, and you had significantly reduced capital budgets. And the capital budgets that were most affective during that period, and I think it's similar in this period are the QA/QC capital budgets, where companies in that period made a decision to long out their replacement cycles. And a lot of our big accounts have absolute qualities to say at five years or six years or seven years they change out all their instruments that hit those time deadlines, and they pretty rigorously during regular periods then go through a replacement cycle.", "In the '93, \u201894 timeframe, we clearly saw them move from that and they longed out their replacement cycle. We see some of those dynamics going on in recent times. We don't see it so much going into important strategic programs, strategic R&D programs, where they are looking to significantly increase or change their processes, improve their productivity. But with just regular replacement cycles, we definitely see some pressure on them longing that out. So that's kind of where I\u2019d say we probably see a similar dynamic. ", "I happen to think that in the long run, we\u2019re probably going to see the same thing. You may remember back in the '90s, we saw almost a couple of years of reduced replacement demand, and then from \u201895 to the end of the \u201890s, granted it was only one dynamic, but we saw pent up replacement demand kick in. I wouldn't be surprised to see some element of that as we move through the next two or three years.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay. Hey, John, you guided towards, I heard you correctly, [$30 million] in net interests?", "John Ornell", "Yes.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "What's going to draw, you ended like 2.2 this quarter. What\u2019s going to drive up the interest expense this year?", "John Ornell", "Our debt was very short this quarter. So we had an effective interest rate of just a percent and a half, and I was just a little nervous extrapolating for the entire year interest at that rate. So I think the rate will more likely [to pay on] debt as we go through the second half of the year, it will be somewhat higher bringing us to the $14 million.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay. Thanks.", "John Ornell", "Yes.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "And I guess when I kind of look at the gross margin number, obviously, the unusual FX and mix contributions that are happening in this quarter and rest of the year are going to roll over. I guess, when you see FX, and things in the business would similarly normalize, how should we look at the gross margin in 2010 and out there? That 150, is the gain sustainable?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I mean, yes. You got to anniversary it. You are not going to be able to repeat it. However, I would just point out that predicting what currency markets are going to do and, you know, the relationships that exist today between the Pound and the Dollar and the Euro is such an oddity that, you know, it's just too difficult, I guess I would say to predict what 2010 is going to really look like until we at least we make our way through the September quarter end.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay, fair enough. And then there is one final question. I wasn't surprised to hear that your instrumentation was down mid-teens, did I hear you correctly say that organically the TA was only down 6%?", "John Ornell", "Yes, that\u2019s true. They were based on small amount of acquisition activity. It would have been nine without that. And even that you could argue is a surprising result given the market; and our estimates for the next couple of quarters is that that business is more likely to be down mid-teens based on what we see. So I think we just didn't see the full impact of the business conditions that are out there affecting the business in the fourth quarter. They also had a pickup in their business to academic. They have a pretty significant piece of business that's down almost a third and their pharma business did relatively well in the first quarter also.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "And also, your TA has about 25% of their business on service that tends to be up very resistant to the downturn also. So they\u2019ve got a bit of a pushing now.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay. And I guess then so what was the weakest instrumentation line? Was it the, I assume, the HPLC business.", "John Ornell", "Yes, I think that's fair to say.", "", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Yes.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The replacement, if you see HPLC business is the one most under pressure. While it may not be second quarter, we think that\u2019s at a low point.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Maybe just to start with a quick follow-up to one of Derik's last questions, how much industrial exposure is there in the Waters division?", "John Ornell", "If you count the chemical business, that's probably somewhere between maybe 8% to 10%, we tend to say that 75% of our business is Life Science, 25% is Industrial, if you will, but India is environmental, food safety. By the time you really [pare] out the chemical, the industrial chemical bit of that, it's close to 10%.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then I want to try to get a better handle on momentum coming out of the quarter. A lot of commentary from your competitors was pretty bleak, January and February. I think many would assert that you guys didn't sound so positive in the early part of March. So did something materially change in mid-March versus how you thought things were coming together in advance of that point in the quarter; and what does this mean in terms of momentum you had heading into Q2?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Let me put my spin on it. John did most of the talking in March, so it's his, sorry John. [In replacements, you were] a little more conservative. I think generally what we have seen is our developed markets, U.S., Japan, and Western Europe, if you look at the underlying activity, quotes, orders, momentum, that all in turned out, or held up better than our initial forecasts. And I\u2019d say it's fair to say probably the month of March was a little bit stronger than we had factored into our models. And that was across the board. So it's interesting.", "There's a mix of companies. You know, Japan is all old, traditional, Japanese pharma; it's not the biggest pharmaceutical companies. And Japan has been coming off of a couple of years of very tough conditions in our world. So you got a mix of what was in the base and what's coming.", "Western Europe was encouraging with the flow of interest coming out of Western Europe. And while the shipments were able to drive through in Western Europe and the U.S. were consistent with kind of our outlook, maybe a little bit more of underlying optimism. I hesitate to use the word 'optimism' because we're clearly not really optimistic, but versus our previous expectations, a little bit more strength than we might have expected to see.", "John Ornell", "The only thing I\u2019d add to that is I think as we have said, particularly in the first quarter, you wait for capital releases. You wait for capital budgets to be released for the year and, working through the start of this difficult year, I might look a little less well because I was holding my breath waiting for the capital releases to make it through the end of the quarter and they did. But it wasn't obvious as we made our way through the entire quarter that that was going to occur.", "Doug Berthiaume", "The other thing that it's more mix dynamic is that, we see a lot of interest in our higher value-added systems. ACQUITY and the new high-end mass spectrometry, it just seems to be a lot of interest. Now we\u2019ll see whether we can convert that into orders and shipments. But particularly, late in the quarter, where customers kind of had a much better handle on what they\u2019d have to spend. We\u2019re surpassing a surprising degree of, again, interest I\u2019d say I had fall short of optimism, but interest.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "All right. I really appreciate your candor. That was really helpful, and I think we all recognize that in this environment optimism is a relative term. The academic research market, that's historically been a smaller part or I guess I should say a smaller percentage of your sales. Do you envision having to make some incremental investments or shifting people around to better position yourself in this end market given the common stimulus fund there?", "Doug Berthiaume", "We think we\u2019re pretty well situated to cover that. Yes, we are always, balancing territory. Last year, we went through a lot because, we have had to consistently look at this big pharma dynamic and see how our sales and service support for them versus emerging biotech and the CROs, et cetera. So it's more on the margin that we have to do it, Doug. It's not a major restructuring that we finally have to go through. I think we\u2019ve been pretty conservative in how we have allocated resources.", "We\u2019ve been very tight with headcount adds because overall our instrument placements were under pressure. So, we are going to be careful with how quickly we add. We think we have got the capacity to cover the existing [bullets of] business. Frankly, I think on the service side we may be under pressure to add a few more service people if we continue to keep up with this level of service. We\u2019ll be tighter on the sales side, I think.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "", "Okay. And last question, I have already got a few e-mails from folks regarding selling days and the impact in the quarter. I just want to make sure this assertion is correct. I think, it will be helpful for people to understand it if it is. The benefit you get from additional selling days, that\u2019s really mostly pronounced at the chemistry line, it really doesn't have as much of an impact for services and instrument line?", "Doug Berthiaume", "[Jump on those] service line and then on the chemistry line.", "John Ornell", "But really, we would say almost nothing on the instrument line.", "Doug Berthiaume", "Operator, I think we have time for one more question and then we will have to close the call.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our final question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Hey, thanks for taking the call. Maybe just an additional color on pharma, because you\u2019ve talked in the past about some of the pharma companies standardizing on ACQUITY, I think AstraZeneca has done it. And I\u2019m just wondering as you look at the year ahead you talked a little about cautious optimism. Are your discussions with pharma getting a little bit more strategic about standardizing around ACQUITY?", "Doug Berthiaume", "The simple answer Tycho is yes. I would say we have seen a high level of interest in almost all of big pharma. A couple of big pharmas, I think we\u2019re going to be in position to announce similar to the one you mentioned, but in this climate, again, you have to right till the very end, you have to be careful about whether they say, if I make that plunge, I have got to commit more capital, even though it will pay itself back in two or three years. Until I see the PO, I'm not ready to declare victory, but this certainly, if somebody asked the question, why are you a little more optimistic, there is such a great deal of interest in ACQUITY, that I think some of that has got to pay a dividend.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "And have you seen any impact from kind of inventory management? I mean we have seen some companies talk about destocking and obviously it's a different dynamic when you are talking about glass slides versus columns, but are you seeing tighter inventory management by your pharma customers.", "Doug Berthiaume", "A little bit, I\u2019d say, probably not a huge amount. We know we saw some in some of our big CRO customers in India, for instance. So yes, I think a part of, a little bit of optimism as we go further on in the year, as we don't think that there can be much more of that inventory management, but I don't think it's been a huge piece of shortfall for us.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then, can you just comment on the competitive landscape? We had a handful of triple quads come out at ASMS last year and can you just update what you are seeing competitively. Do you anticipate you are going to continue to take share going forward or how do you look at the market?", "Doug Berthiaume", "Well, I think, it's a very competitive industry and we have got worthy mass spec competitors. I think the mass spec universe is more competitive than the chromatography universe. I think it's much more of an oligarchy in the chromatography world. I think we are particularly happy with our current positioning in the mass spec world, and from what we see from customers and what we think we are going to see at ASMS, we are very happy.", "That doesn't mean that we think we have got the world by the horn. Well, horn is probably the wrong part of the anatomy. But it's a very competitive world. Others are going to introduce products. It's a very healthy, competitive world, but I think compared to some years, I feel more comfortable this year than perhaps I have in some years.", "Doug Berthiaume", "You're welcome. Operator, I think we will let these kind people get back to their regular jobs now.", "Operator", "Okay. Thank you, sir. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

All participants will be in a listen only until the question and answer session of the conference.  This conference is being recorded.  If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.  I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "Welcome to the Waters Corporation second quarter financial results conference call.  With me on today\u2019s call is John Ornell, the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and as is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter\u2019s highlights, John will follow with the details on our financial results and provide you with an outlook for the full year.  But, before we get going I\u2019d like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John A. Ornell ", "During the course of this conference call we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company.  In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for Q3 and full year 2009.  We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and actual events or results may differ materially.  ", "For a detailed discussion of some of the risk and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations see our 10K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 in part one under the caption business risk factors.  We further caution you that the company does no obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions.  We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results accept during our regularly scheduled earnings release conference calls and webcasts.  The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October, 2009.  ", "During this call we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures.  A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning.  In our discussion of the results of operations we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of the items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled reconciliation of net income per diluted share included in this morning\u2019s press release.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "The demand patterns that we talked to you about in April largely continued in the second quarter.  Overall, our business with industrial accounts, firms closely tied to the production of chemicals that are used in the manufacture of consumer goods was the weakest.  Similar to the first quarter, our pharmaceutical end market showed modest decline in line with the company\u2019s overall sales results.  On the bright side, we continue to enjoy strong growth from our combined government and academic customers.  ", "Our sales in the quarter were down 4% on a currency neutral basis and we were able to deliver 3% earnings growth due to favorable product mix, disciplined price and cost controls, favorable currency translation and leverage from our share repurchase program.  To look at the top line, our recurring revenue, the combination of our service and chromatography chemicals businesses grew more modestly in the quarter while the decline in our instrument business was more moderate than in the first quarter.  ", "The slower second quarter year-over-year growth rate for our recurring revenues primarily due to a tough comparison with the prior year\u2019s quarter.  We feel that the 2009 half year growth rate for our recurring revenue is more indicative of underlying demand and we expect mid single digit currency neutral sales growth for our chemistry and service business during the second half of the year.  ", "Looking more closely at instrumentation, we attribute the quarter\u2019s revenue decline to weak demand from industrial chemical accounts and from some developing countries.  We believe the weakness in industrial spending is related to global recessionary pressures while declines in developing countries, most notably India and Latin America seemed due to a combination of economic factors and the residual effects of weakened local currency.  ", "Similar to what we saw in the first quarter, demand for high end and application focused systems were stronger for more routine analysis instruments that are often purchased to replace older systems.  Customer interest was strongest for research mass spectrometry and ACQUITY UPLC instruments.  If you look at our end markets, overall pharmaceutical sales volume declined modestly in the quarter and was in line with the company\u2019s overall performance while weaker industrial sales were offset by stronger government and university spending.", "Sales to our top pharmaceutical customers, our 15 largest drug accounts, were up in the second quarter and showed some acceleration from the growth we witnessed in the first quarter.  We were particularly encouraged by more broad adoption of ACQUITY UPLC by these firms.  Geographically, our fastest growing major market was China where sales to government agencies, universities and applied markets were all strong.  In India, the declines that we saw in this quarter were not as severe as in the first quarter and there are some indications that we  are likely to see some continued improvements in the second half of 2009.", "As I mentioned earlier and now speaking specifically for the waters division, we continued to see stronger demand for research oriented instrument systems.  ACQUITY UPLC shipments grew in the quarter and were positively impacted by broader adoption of the technology by large drug companies, a trend that we believe will continue throughout the second half of this year.  Sales of ACQUITY column, the family of chromatography consumables specifically designed for our ACQUITY UPLC systems suggest a continued near complete column utilization rate for the installed base of ACQUITY systems and were up double digits in the quarter. ", "Sales of our newly introduced Xevo mass spectrometry systems researched instruments that offer advanced performance and ease of use with space saving bench top designs were also strong in the quarter.  At this year\u2019s ASMS conference we introduced a new high end mass spectrometry platform called the SYNAPT G2.  We feel that the G2 has the potential to redefine performance standards in research mass spectrometry and displays alternative high resolution geometries with its unique combination of high speed, high resolution, high mass accuracy and proprietary shape characterization capabilities.  We booked several orders for new SYNAPT G2 systems in the second quarter and plan to begin shipments in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "Our TA instruments division core thermal product lines were again affected by industrial chemical manufacturers continuing to rein in their spending.  In addition, the division had a tough prior year comparison.  We believe that we are either maintaining or gaining market share with our TA product line and are encouraged by sales growth of our life science thermal line.  Despite the tough market conditions TA has successfully maintained high profitability through disciplined pricing policies and prudent expense control.", "Earlier this year we announced the acquisition of Thar Instruments, the world leader in super critical fluid chromatography, a separation technology closely related to HPLC that primarily uses more environmentally friendly carbon dioxide as the [mobile] phase.  I\u2019m pleased to tell you that Thar delivered a strong second quarter sales result and that plans are proceeding to further leverage Thar technology in the second half of 2009.  ", "Customers are increasingly interested in reducing chemical waste and running their labs in a more green manner.  Thar\u2019s SFT technology in combination with the dramatic solvent savings enabled by ACQUITY UPLC have allowed Waters to assume a leadership in cost effective and environmentally friendly laboratory technology.  Companies such as Thar represent the type of firm that Waters is targeting on the M&A front in that it is close to us technologically, profitable and has top line potential to be accretive to our overall growth rate. ", "Before I turn you over to John for a look at our financials, I\u2019d like to qualitatively say a few words about our outlook for the remainder of this year.  I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about the second half of this year as I feel we have likely already seen the worst effects of the weak economy on our instrumentation demand and have now experienced three sequential quarters of fairly stable pharmaceutical spending.  ", "Jumping ahead to the fourth quarter, we will anniversary the onset of the economic troubles that have pressured our industrial segment and should begin to see benefits of stimulus related governmental spending in the US.  Though consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry and uncertainties related to governmental healthcare proposals could impact future business, we\u2019re not currently feeling that these issues are likely to pressure our second half results.", "Some of the sales growth that we will see in the fourth quarter will come as a result of orders for new mass spectrometry instruments and we have already booked or anticipate booking in the third quarter.  Specifically I\u2019m referring to systems that incorporate our new SYNAPT G2 platform.  Again, researchers are very excited about potential for this new technology on their scientific workflow and some are opting to wait for fourth quarter deliveries rather than to accept shipment in an earlier time of a less capable instruments from either us or our competitors.  So the timing of G2 shipments will result in lower sales of high end mass spec in the third quarter, our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full second half of 2009 is now better than we could have expected prior to our ASMS launch of the SYNAPT G2.", "Generally, we expect that the market conditions that we have experienced in the first half of \u201909 will extend in to the third quarter.  Operationally, we will continue to carefully control our spending and continue our efforts to improve efficiency.  On the R&D front, our new product pipeline is very strong and we plan significant new product launches in the coming quarters.", "In closing, despite current challenges, I feel we are close to seeing an improvement in our business.  In the second half of this year the combination of our new mass spec platforms, continued penetration of the LC market with ACQUITY UPLC and reaching the anniversary of the beginning of last year\u2019s economic slowdown give me confidence in a stronger finish to 2009.  Longer term 2010 and beyond, we believe we are poised to deliver advanced instrument systems to our customers, return to a top line growth that\u2019s more consistent with our history and generate superior earnings growth and cash flow for our investors. ", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to John.", "John A. Ornell ", "Second quarter sales declined by 9% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.78 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.76 last year.  On a GAAP basis our earnings were $0.72 this quarter compared to $0.82 last year.  Our GAAP results this quarter contained a charge for exiting rented facilities at our TA Instrument site in Delaware.  A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Reviewing our Q2 sales results, sales were down 9% this quarter with currency translation representing 5% of this decline.  Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange affects, sales continued to be soft in the US and Europe where sales declined by 6% and 4% respectively.  In Japan, sales grew by 5% versus a weak base of comparison last year and sales to Asia outside of Japan grew by 1% against a strong base of comparison.", "Turning to the product front, within the waters division instrument system sales declined by 8% and recurring revenues grew by 2% this quarter.  Recurring revenues were somewhat softer than anticipated this quarter and through the half are on plan with 5% growth.  We believe the consumables demand might be a bit more variable this year but should still be around mid single digit growth for the full year.  Within our TA instruments division sales declined by 12% versus prior year.  ", "Now, I would like to comment on our non-GAAP financial performance.  Gross margin continued to be very favorable versus prior year and came in at 60.3%, up 210 basis points.  This improvement was again heavily affected by continued favorable foreign exchange dynamics this quarter.  Year-over-year the Yen continued to provide a positive translation benefit of our Japanese sales with no offsetting local manufacturing costs impacting our cost of sales.  In the UK we have more local production and a larger service cost base than local sales providing for significant margin improvement given the relative weakness of the pound.", "Additionally, we experienced favorable product mix as a higher proportion of our sales came from chemistry and service where productivity was high given the headcount and cost controls in place.  SG&A expenses declined by 8% this quarter compared to prior year as a result of our actions to control expenses and currency translation effects.  We continue to take a strong position on expense control and plan to continue to hold back on discretionary spending in response to the depressed economic conditions we face.  R&D expenses declined by 11% this quarter as a result of currency translation effects on expenses in our UK R&D group.  ", "We currently expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%.  The slight increase in our rate from Q1 is the result of an anticipated shift in income in to higher tax rate jurisdictions.  The impact of this change resulted in an operating effective rate of 19% this quarter or a $0.01 reduction in earnings for the quarter.  ", "On the balance sheet, cash and short term investments totaled $506 million and debt totaled $631 million bringing us to a net debt position of about $125 million.  On the stock buyback front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market and during the second quarter we purchased one million shares of our common stock for $45 million.  We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any non-cash tax benefit from FAS 123R accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items.", "For Q2, free cash flow was $63 million after funding $36 million of cap ex and excluding a $6 million lease termination charge relating to our new TA facility.  Capital expenditures this quarter included $18 million of facility costs related to our TA instrument site.  Comparably without this outlay cash flow would have been $81 million this quarter versus $89 last year.  Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 74 days this quarter, two days better than last quarter but up four days from Q2 last year.  Inventories were about flat this quarter as we adjusted manufacturing plans to align with demand.  ", "As we look to the second half of the year we currently expect difficult economic conditions to persist.  We will continue to hold back where possible on discretionary spending but doing so could become more difficult as the year goes on so I expect a modest additional spending increase will be required later in the second half of the year.  Gross margin as a percent of sales should be less favorable as the year progresses as beneficial foreign exchange dynamics diminish and as instrument shipments become a larger proportion of sales later in the year.  ", "So, for full year 2009 we believe our recurring revenues will likely grow at a mid single digit rate for the year while instrument demand is expected to be down between mid single and high single digits for the full year.  Overall, we are expecting full year sales to be down between 2% and 4% before currency effects.  Foreign exchange translation will reduce 2009 sales growth by about 3% at current rates.  Therefore, on a reported basis we are expecting sales to decline between 5% and 7% for the full year.", "Moving down the P&L, we expect gross margins to be up from 2008 as a result of the factors I described earlier.  Currency translation benefits have been discounted as I said earlier and product mix will become less favorable as instrument sales volumes increases.  For the full year, we now expect to see a margin improvement of around 150 basis points.  Operating expenses are expected to decline at a rate about equal to the sales and our operating tax rate is expected to be about 18.5%.  Net interest expense is expected to be in the neighborhood of $11 million and our fully diluted average outstanding share count for the full year 2009 is currently estimated to be 97 million shares.", "Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.28 to $3.38 per share with sales declining between 5% and 7%.  For Q3 we expect our currency neutral sales to decline at a rate comparable to the first half results.  Any potential sequential improvement in customer demand this quarter could easily be offset by a shift in to Q4 of orders associated with stimulus spending and Q4 shipments of our new high end mass spec system.", "At current exchange rates, currency translation will reduce sales growth by about 3%.  Considering these factors non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter are expected to be between $0.74 and $0.79.  For Q4 we expect our currency neutral sales to be about flat and currency translation to increase sales growth by 1%.  Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be between $1.01 and $1.06 for Q4.  ", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "Operator I think we can open it up for Q&A now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan Securities.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "I\u2019m wondering if you can kind of elaborate on your pharma comments around ACQUITY.  You\u2019ve talked in the past about standardization, I\u2019m wondering if this is a process that\u2019s been accelerated at all with these deals closing or just if you could provide additional color around what\u2019s going on with ACQUITY at pharma?  Is this mainly in the QC labs or any additional details would be helpful.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "I think where the most positive, most encouraging is related to those broad based applications closer to QC than in the traditional ACQUITY stronghold in R&D.  We saw one particular very large domestic pharmaceutical company, I think I\u2019ve talked about it before, I mean last year we saw a European based large pharmaceutical company basically decide to go across the board to UPLC and we saw a similar dynamic domestically this time.  So, even in a time of tough instrument placements we\u2019re seeing ACQUITY continue to grow year-over-year.", "That\u2019s largely a pharma dynamic.  So, I think what you\u2019re seeing is penetration in to those more \u2013 the benefits of the UPLC on the research side have been overwhelming.  The cracking more deeply in to the regular QC side where companies have got to face the issue of how many do they change out, do they change them out all at one time particularly at a time of reduced capital spending is a tougher sell, we\u2019re seeing progress on that front.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "You talked in your comments as well about some of the deferred orders for the new SYNAPT system, I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to how big the magnitude is here.  Is this something that was significant in this quarter and maybe some color on what you\u2019re expecting for the third quarter ahead of the fourth quarter launch?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "Well, we just showed it at ASMS really the beginning of June so we weren\u2019t even able to demo it until that time.  We\u2019re now demoing it very extensively and I\u2019d say the customer response has been as strong as any instrument we\u2019ve introduced in the last five years.  So, I would say we\u2019re very, very enthusiastic about the customer response.  We have seen a number of orders already in the second quarter, we\u2019ve seen that accelerate in to the third quarter.  ", "It needs to be clear that we\u2019re not going to ship any of these in the third quarter.  Our production plan doesn\u2019t really start shipping until the fourth quarter but we\u2019re reasonably confident we can ship a substantial number in the fourth quarter.  I would say our financial forecast tries to draw a midline in that fourth quarter expectation.  It\u2019s very possible that this could be a defining factor of exceeding that number if we\u2019re successful in getting as many manufacturers in to the marketplace as we think.  That\u2019s probably as strong as I can talk about G2.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "Then just one last one on capital deployment, can you talk a little bit about the outlook on M&A versus buybacks?  Obviously with some of the deals we\u2019ve started to see it looks like the valuation gaps come in a little bit so if you could just talk a little bit on priorities there that would be great.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "I think valuations certainly came down across the board last year.  Valuations in the past six months have clearly come up a bit in our industry.  Our idea of what suits Waters appropriately in the M&A front hasn\u2019t changed from the low valuation to the high valuation, we still like our core capabilities, our core businesses.  We\u2019re absolutely convinced that we could do some accretive mergers that are larger than the mergers we typically do but we\u2019re not convinced that two or three years down the road that we can grow that consolidated business at the pace we can grow our core competencies.", "So, that\u2019s the conundrum, you can deploy more capital but in the end you have to wake up in the morning and be happy with who you\u2019re living with and we\u2019re not convinced that the larger ones that we have kicked the tires on satisfy those objectives.  So, we\u2019ll continue to do the Thar kind of deals, the targeted smaller technology deals or some bolt ons.  We\u2019ve done some bolt ons to our testing businesses that we\u2019re very happy with.  It doesn\u2019t deploy a huge amount of capital that way and so we\u2019re left with buying in more of our stock in all likelihood.", "John A. Ornell ", "For the year, if you look at the buyback program, we\u2019re just over $100 million at the half way point.  We talked about executing about $200 million for the full year so we\u2019re pretty much on plan to meet that original expectation.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "John actually just one housekeeping on the tax rate, have you quantified the potential impact of the Obama proposal?", "John A. Ornell ", "Until we get to the point where that\u2019s somewhat clearer as it makes its way through Congress, it\u2019s difficult to quantify that.  Some very early views of that would suggest that perhaps based on some of the deductions that perhaps won\u2019t be allowable in the US going forward that it could be a 300 to 400 basis point impact on us but it\u2019s very early.  It\u2019s still up in the air, I don\u2019t think we can really nail that down to a specific number at this point in time.  I think I\u2019ve heard others in our space quantify it similarly, I don\u2019t think based on our starting point that we\u2019re going to be impacted dramatically different from others in the space.  But, I\u2019d quantify it somewhere in that range based on what I know today.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "With respect to kind of the industrial side could you delineate you talked about price discipline, is it that the customers that are buying are not price sensitive and is it just no projects so there is no buying and then as it comes back is it more binary or is there kind of elasticity of demand as well?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "I think there\u2019s relatively little elasticity Quintin.  In times like this, I think we\u2019ve seen certain competitors struggle and in the end try to use price to disgorge orders.  I think in many cases the desperation tactic over a long period of time and most of our instrument businesses experience has taught us that price isn\u2019t a long term determinant of how these customers react.  They are much  more concerned with service, support, continuity and that price falls relatively low on their list which is not to say that in any one circumstance, particularly if it\u2019s a university account of certain others that somebody might not squeeze an order out with a large discount.", "We have a golden rule that we treat our customers with the respect that they deserve and we live to our worldwide contracts and it\u2019s very, very rare that we wander outside those discount guidelines.  So, I think our customers respect that and in the end it holds us in good stead.  I don\u2019t see us losing significant orders to price competition in this environment.  I think it\u2019s substantially a case that those customers are not releasing any capital money, or any capital money is probably a little bit strong but there are substantially diminished capital budgets.", "That may improve largely because of the weak base in the fourth quarter.  I don\u2019t see that improving very much in the third quarter.  I do see from the people, particularly TA and the people who are most focused on those industrial chemical accounts in the US, that it is not getting worse but it\u2019s not very good.  So, I think we\u2019ve seen the bottom of that but I wouldn\u2019t expect you to see any light at the end of the tunnel until possibly the fourth quarter.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "John, just to reconfirm, the pro forma EPS guidance you updated $3.28 to $3.38, that seems to be an increase from your last guidance, is that right?", "John A. Ornell ", "Yes, the upper end of the range is higher by $0.08 and we narrowed the range as well because I think we\u2019re feeling a little bit more confident in the second half of the year and hitting these numbers so there\u2019s a $0.10 differential, $0.05 a quarter which is a little bit closer to where we\u2019ve been historically in trying to call the bottom line.  So, it is raised as a result of expectations really more in the fourth quarter as a result of the stimulus spend and some of the shipments of the G2 that we talked about that we\u2019re a bit more confident about as we said today.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "And we were at the high end of our guidance in the second quarter Quintin.", "John A. Ornell ", "That\u2019s right.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "We think on balance there are probably more things that could go right for us in the second half than wrong.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "So the outlook plus the G2 even offsets kind of what looks like to us a little bit higher tax rate and share count then?", "John A. Ornell ", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann & Company.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann & Company", "First thing, on the pharma and markets I think you kind of mentioned in the beginning comments that it was down a little bit and then later you said it was sort of sequentially stable.  So, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing there maybe between demand for equipment versus the utilization of the consumables.  Then, given that you are taking that sort of higher guidance outlook for the rest of the year, what\u2019s your level of confidence in the fourth quarter as a lot of these mergers close that you won\u2019t see any disruption in that underlying business beyond the stimulus and the SNYAPT catalyst that you talked about?", "John A. Ornell ", "I\u2019d say on the pharma business in total while overall the pharma business was down slightly in the quarter, the trends that we saw in large pharma where we\u2019ve said that we\u2019ve seen some sequential stability in the results, we actually saw some growth in the first half of the year and that accelerated a little bit in the second quarter.  I would say that we\u2019ve talked about weakness in large pharma for a few years here so the effects of the economy I would say are a little bit different on this group of customers than industrial chemical and more GDP centric type businesses.", "The large pharma accounts, at least for us at this time we would say feel more stable, feels like the interest in the ACQUITY, the interest in the new mass spec products will continue to allow us to see growth in that segment of our business.  Outside of large pharma the other accounts are still under pressure, some of the generic accounts CROs continue to struggle for us but all in we\u2019re looking at a low single digit decline for that group of customers with large pharma really being the best performer.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann & Company", "Then if you could maybe walk us through as I look at sort of forward quarters on the gross margin line aside from currency, how should we think about blotchy years in ACQUITY, the progress you made in maybe growing the gross margin on maybe that product line and now that it\u2019s at full scale here, how much head room do you think you have left considering the potential move in the Singapore manufacturing?", "John A. Ornell ", "I\u2019d say that if we look at the all in margins on the ACQUITY product we started off, as you know, somewhere in the 50s, we\u2019re in the low 60s at this stage and we\u2019re at the point now where we\u2019re looking, as you know, moving that product to Singapore, that is in the early phases of the move.  There\u2019s nothing from a technology perspective that would prevent it from moving in the mid and high 60s across a few years as we make that transition and ramp up the production in Singapore.  ", "So, for that product alone I would say there\u2019s definitely some margin improvement that would could expect as these transitions occur.  As we think about gross margins on a year-over-year basis as we start thinking about next year, you certainly have to take in to account the fact that we\u2019ve had some pretty significant improvements in margins associated with currency.  So, currency movements could to some extent offset whatever that pickup could be.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann & Company", "The last one here on sort of fourth quarter assumptions, did I hear you right in assuming that you have some expectations for stimulus orders to be booked in that quarter.", "John A. Ornell ", "Yes, they\u2019ll be booked in that quarter but they\u2019ll also be booked \u2013 some were booked in the second quarter, more in the third, we talked about it but yes, they\u2019ll be booked and shipped in the fourth quarter as well.  The expectation is that that stimulus spend will lob over in to next year as well.  So, it\u2019s a multi quarter impact where the beginning of it for us we believe will be in the fourth quarter.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "We\u2019re seeing a huge amount of quote activity related to stimulus spending Isaac and we\u2019ve also seen pretty clearly some delays in orders that probably would have come through without stimulus money but some of those academic government accounts are waiting for the stimulus money to take the place of some of their own internal monies.  So, it\u2019s hard to imagine that all of this quote activity doesn\u2019t make its way through shipments in the latter half of this year.  Frankly, we\u2019re not counting on a huge amount of that in terms of our sales expectations, that could be another piece that if we\u2019re conservative there that may turn out to be a little bit better than we\u2019ve baked in.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Derik deBruin \u2013 UBS.", "Derik deBruin \u2013 UBS", "What did Thar add to Q2 and then on a further note, what\u2019s the latest in terms of the acetonitrile trial shortage?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "Acquisitions added in total about 2% in the quarter and about 1% for the first half results.  So, Thar was successful for us, we\u2019re looking at continuing to ramp that technology up through the second half of the year, being able to sell that under the Waters umbrella seems to be an opportunity that is at least on plan for us as we look at the second half of the year so acquisitions look like they\u2019ll continue to be a small add or two to sales across the second half.", "Derik deBruin \u2013 UBS", "And do you see the acetonitrile shortage, has that shown any signs of being elevated?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "Not substantially at this point.  There are some forecasts that those plants are coming back a little bit on stream but even if it does come back on stream Derik I think the attention on the acetonitrile, the risk of supply is still very high in the minds of our customers and together with this whole green initiative I think has swung our accounts to really paying attention to solvent consumption and solvent usage.  So, while the absolute status of acetonitrile might get a little bit better, I think from our point of view it still works to our advantage that they\u2019ve had to go through this.", "Derik deBruin \u2013 UBS", "I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the comments here, so the organic growth is lower and the expenses are going to tweak a little bit higher in the second half so I guess is there going to be a big change in some of the below the line items to kind of get you to the higher end of the guidance range?", "John A. Ornell ", "If you look at the second quarter, the growth without M&A is down 6% which it was in the first quarter too so I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re comparing against.", "Derik deBruin \u2013 UBS", "I was just basically saying that if you kind of look at it for \u2013 well, I mean because you changed your fx impact from down 4% to down 3% fx impact on the top line.", "John A. Ornell ", "That\u2019s right, that\u2019s in the third quarter and then by the fourth quarter fx is actually positive.  The big difference in the second half really is the fact that in the fourth quarter we anniversary if you will the recession to some extent and where we grew in the base about 7% a quarter across the first three quarters and the fourth quarter we were organically flat.  So, we\u2019re expecting to be flat on that base with a percent of sales pickup from fx so fx and the anniversarying of the recession if you will, is really the delta in the second half that makes it different from the first half.  We\u2019re really not saying that the pace of the business if you will dramatically picks up in that guidance.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Can we go in to a little bit of detail about what\u2019s behind the consumables decline and maybe what\u2019s happening in some of your end markets it didn\u2019t grow as fast as you guys thought?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "Sure, the consumables business was a little bit slower in the second quarter than it was in the first.  First quarter we had a calendar dynamic that gave us several extra days.  In the second quarter we had a relatively strong base where we had some customers placing large standing orders in last year.  So, when you look at 2009 I don\u2019t think the actual customer demand pattern was all that different between the second quarter and the first quarter but the reported results were slower sales growth.  That\u2019s why we think the second half is kind of an average of the first and the second quarter.", "The real demand pattern, what we talked about pretty much in the first quarter, customers have run fewer samples, they\u2019re looking at various ways to save expenses across the board and I don\u2019t think that dynamic is going to change too much in the second half of the year.  We\u2019re not expecting a seat change in the way our consumables and service business operates in the second half and probably we think we have a somewhat brighter picture for next year but we\u2019re not anticipating that in the second half.  ", "Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Then you mentioned that industrial demand in TA is bottoming and you said there might be a little bit of light in the fourth quarter, does that also translate to the industrials for the Waters division?  And, when you\u2019re talking about this demand, is it kind of the usual seasonality related to people just kind of finishing out the year and spending the money that they didn\u2019t spend already or do you think it\u2019s kind of a real recovery demand that you\u2019re getting a sense of?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "Speaking specifically about TA, as we monitor requests for quotations and demo activity, we saw that dynamic flatten out at the end of the first quarter and as we moved through the second quarter, we saw our internal statistics improve.  Now, that didn\u2019t manifest itself in orders and sales in the second quarter but we think that\u2019s an early indicator that customers have hit their bottom and are looking to improve in the second half.  Now, that\u2019s off a much lower run rate so we\u2019re not declaring victory on that but it\u2019s better than [inaudible].  ", "You get in to the fourth quarter and clearly you\u2019ve got a lower base because you\u2019ve got the dynamic of the financial crisis and the demand reductions in the fourth quarter so, you\u2019ve clearly got a lower base to compare against.  I also think it may be more important in the pharmaceuticals and the life science areas but the fourth quarter of \u201908 you saw a massive reduction in confidence and people took early action to just carve back on their spending and it was as fast as I\u2019ve ever seen in this industry.", "I think it\u2019s all together possible that you\u2019ll see just the opposite happen at the end of this year, that people get more confident, they\u2019re not cutting back on capital spending, they may not get as ebullient but I think it\u2019s very possible that you\u2019ll see some end of the year money.  That\u2019s kind of certainly what we\u2019d hope to see, we\u2019re not banking on that in our forecast but I think you could see that in the industrial accounts but particularly you could see it in the science area too.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Could you talk a bit about some of the end of year expenses that are going to be needed as growth reaccelerates in to 2010 and sort of how you\u2019re thinking about some of the different lines that might have changed this year whether it\u2019s salaries or bonus or other and how we should think about modeling that as we enter 2010?", "John A. Ornell ", "I guess I would say first off where we have held back on some of the service side of the business is probably one that is going to get some of the most attention.  There\u2019s been a headcount freeze in place across the organizations with rare exceptions of some locations outside of the US where we\u2019ve had to keep up with increased demand, so adding some service headcount in the field in support of that business is probably one of the first areas we\u2019ll start looking at.", "There was a full pay freeze in place based on the conditions this year.  We\u2019re going to have to reassess that based on market conditions for next year.  I mean, that\u2019s certainly another area that we\u2019ll look at.  Some of the more discretionary items on travel and meetings and that type of spend.  We can be a little bit more conservative depending on how the economy picks up as we move in to next year.  So, I wouldn\u2019t say at this stage that there\u2019s going to be a huge sum of increase spend across the board that\u2019s going to be dilutive if you will, to the earnings growth should we have a modest increase in the top line, but it\u2019s very early on to be able to quantify that.", "Some of these expenses will begin in the fourth quarter, there will probably be some amount of service heads that we\u2019re just going to have to put in place but I think you\u2019ll see a rather modest increase in expenses as we exit the year.  It\u2019s really more a budgetary planning cycle affect for next year that we can talk more about perhaps on the October or January call.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "From a market perspective, you noted India was weak, that\u2019s been a function of currency, that started to unwind a bit, has that shown any signs of life or is that sort of still in a difficult fx comp scenario?  Then, to that effect, are you seeing any sort of change from the zero demand there or anywhere else inclusive of the US?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "Ross, the second quarter was a bit better than the first quarter.  We anticipated it was going to be a relatively short term dynamic and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.  We anticipate that the third quarter will be better than the second quarter and the fourth quarter will be better than that.  I think it will be 2010 before we see a relative return to normalcy but the encouraging thing about India as their actual shipments of generic drugs have continued to grow robustly quarter after quarter so I think there isn\u2019t too long that they can put off the instrumentation of that kind of growth and I expect that we\u2019ll see the second half significantly better than the first half.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Just because I\u2019m getting a bunch of emails here even though I think I may have it John, in terms of the sort of top three things that changed on the guidance line to get to the new EPS range, I mean it seems like fx improved and you have a slightly better outlook than the back half but can you just sort of delineate the three key changes to sort of get us there again?  I\u2019m sorry, I just feel like people are a bit confused.", "John A. Ornell ", "I meant the upper end of the range was raised by $0.08 and the improvement there is fx on the top line and currency is going to be favorable now by the time we get to the fourth quarter.  That wasn\u2019t the case before.  We\u2019ve continued to hold back on spend to a larger extent perhaps than I had originally estimated as well.  The benefits on gross margin continued in the second quarter, not at the rate they were in the first but better than I had originally anticipated in to the second.  So, I would say those factors coupled with the G2 release and the early excitement on what we might deliver in the fourth quarter made us feel much more confident in the numbers that we\u2019re rolling up for the field on the possible shipments on the high end mass spec later in the year are probably the biggest factors.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Sorry to beat a dead horse on guidance but I just went back to look at the transcript from Q1 to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing anything and in fact it doesn\u2019t look like I did.  On the Q1 call you guided the street to expect full year constant currency growth of down 4% to up 1%.  You\u2019ve revised that to down 4% to down 2% for the full year so again, assuming this is an apples-to-apples comparison, you maintain the low end of the range but you lowered the high end of the range.  I just want to make sure that we\u2019re not missing something here.  Is there some specific end market where you are actually taken a more conservative stance?", "John A. Ornell ", "The answer there is that the financial guidance that I provide on the earnings line is more associated with the bottom of the organic sales range and to the extent that we had gotten anywhere near zero or plus one, we would have gone well over the earnings per share guidance that was provided.  I did not want to create a financial model at the bottom line that assumed we had gotten all the way to the top of the organic sales range so I typically try and construct the earnings at the bottom line somewhere near the bottom of the expectation for organic growth, that\u2019s the difference.", "At this stage, just based on where we\u2019ve landed in the third quarter, it\u2019s less likely that we\u2019re going to get to that plus one so we\u2019ve been I\u2019d say more realistic in what the full year expectation will be on the sales range and the continued profitability of sales even when they decline in the mid single digits is encouraging enough that we\u2019re able to still leverage positive earnings growth through the first half in the earnings guidance and for the second half in reality we\u2019re looking at earnings per share relatively flat with prior year to get to that $3.28 to $3.38 number.", "From that perspective you could say that the earnings flow through is more conservative in the second half than the first, much of it associated with a currency environment that\u2019s getting slightly less favorable from a gross margin and the bottom line flow through perspective.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "In the past you\u2019ve talked about a 1% fx move equating to about $0.05 at the bottom line on a full year basis, is that still a good rule of thumb?", "John A. Ornell ", "I\u2019d say once we get passed this year and currencies behave the way maybe they historically have that\u2019s probably right.  That wasn\u2019t true for the first half of this year, we haven\u2019t had the full amount of pain on the currency line because of the fact that we\u2019ve had a positive Yen, a negative Euro and an extremely negative British Pound dynamic, all of which have leveraged to better flow through at the gross margin line.  To the extent the currencies behave more normally and move in the same direction to the US dollar, the rule of thumb you described is accurate it just hasn\u2019t been accurate this year.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Then one last question, Doug you in your prepared remarks talked about at a high level about returning to top line growth in 2010 that resembles your historical norms.  How dependent is this on a rebound in industrial and what is the risk to this target associated with big pharma consolidation?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "In terms of big pharma consolidation, if we see a major change in existing dynamics, I suppose that\u2019s a wild card.  For the already announced mergers I don\u2019t think it means too much to our expectations.  I think 2010 I\u2019m frankly probably a little bit more confident in my heart than I am willing to put down on paper right now.  We\u2019re seeing real demand reductions in 2009 that with all of the dynamics moving for us, I think if you just go back to 2008 dynamics you\u2019re going to see mid to high single digit growth.", "We continue to see strong demand coming out of Asia and frankly I don\u2019t see a whole lot that\u2019s putting that at risk.  I think India returns to a more normal dynamic next year which coming off this base could be a substantial piece of growth.  Our Latin America business I think we\u2019ll actually see a better return in the second half of this year but better dynamics next year.  The key question marks are Western Europe and the United States which are the major pieces of our business.", "Coming off this year I\u2019m more confident that 2010 is going to be better.  But, it remains to be seen.  The industrial piece has been terrible for three quarters now specifically related to this industrial chemical business, specifically kind of tied to the consumer, to the auto industry or auto derived demand.  You\u2019re guess is probably as good as mine in terms of have we seen the worse of that or do we see another year of that.  I frankly think it\u2019s hard to imagine that you could see another year as bad as 2009 and I\u2019d project that it gets better in 2010.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On the gross margin line, do you guys mind in the quarter just walking us through the moving pieces in terms of currency contribution year-on-year and then what sort of changed sequentially from the first quarter?", "John A. Ornell ", "If you look at the gross margin improvement of about 210 basis points, the Yen was up on average about 7% year-over-year, that\u2019s a couple of million of benefit, there\u2019s not cost of sales associated with \u2013 you don\u2019t need protection in that country so there\u2019s about 60 bips improvement associated with that.  In the UK we have about $10 million or so of cost greater than sales.  The currency movement there was about 20% year-over-year within the quarter, that\u2019s another couple of million dollars of improvement, a 120 basis points coming from currency and there was a little bit of spill over affect from capitalized variances in the first quarter so maybe about 150 basis points or two thirds or so of the improvement that we saw in gross margin was associated with these currency dynamics that I\u2019m describing.", "Beyond that the service margins continued to be much higher year-over-year as you saw in the first quarter and that along with some cost reductions in mix were another 60 or so basis points.  Versus the first quarter the Yen was up closer to 10% to 12%, the Pound was off almost 30% instead of 20% so these benefits were just greater just because of currency movements within the quarter but still on a year-over-year basis very significant.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Then you alluded to this before, so should we think about as you restaff on service, is that a second half \u201909 or is that in to 2010?", "John A. Ornell ", "It\u2019s going to be more of a 2010 event.  You\u2019re going to continue to see \u2013 and, even that could take a while to staff that up a bit.  You\u2019re unlikely to see the service piece of this benefit decline substantially between now and the end of the year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital (USA).", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital (USA)", "I guess just looking again kind of as a lot of people saying okay let\u2019s get past 2009 looking in to 2010 and John giving your comments around gross margin, it sounds like you\u2019re kind of on track with the ACQUITY move to Singapore with the puts and takes, and I know it\u2019s kind of a first blush but would be your expectations with respect to gross margins on a year-over-year basis between 2009 and 2010 just kind of given what you know?", "John A. Ornell ", "I think currency aside I guess I would say that the product movements that you described hopefully some growth in instruments next year versus this year to help cover some of the inflation on that front would certainly allow us to provide some organic improvement in gross margins on a year-over-year basis.  Though, I have to say on the fx side, just given the outstanding performance of currency and kind of that perfect storm we\u2019ve talked about coming through the first half of the year, it\u2019s just unlikely from my perspective that that\u2019s going to repeat itself or be in a position where we\u2019re going to see that it doesn\u2019t create a difficult base of comparison that\u2019s probably going to eat away a significant amount of that organic improvement or more than that.", "I mean that has yet to be proven so I\u2019d say for what we can manage on the gross margin side, I\u2019m feeling very comfortable that we can deliver an improvement next year and it\u2019s really going to come down to what the basket of currencies will do to us and that\u2019s not something that\u2019s easy to predict this early on.", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital (USA)", "So just kind of flowing that through and your commentary on cost as you move to 2010 and assuming as Doug said that you got some of the [inaudible], I mean  historically you got quite a bit of leverage on mid to mid high single digit organic growth.  Is it fair to say that moving in to 2010 expect a little less kind of earnings leverage relative to your history?", "John A. Ornell ", "I mean that\u2019s probably fair to say.  I mean, we\u2019ve done a lot of belt tightening certainly this year and so we\u2019ve created a difficult base of comparison from that perspective.  I don\u2019t think we can ask the business to grow without some amount of investment next year so keeping in the traditional two or three percentage point gap between the growth in sales and the growth in expenses if we\u2019re going to be somewhat cautious on the top line as we move in to next year is going to be a bit more difficult. So, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re going to start off with a cautious perspective. ", "We hope that we\u2019ll still be able to continue to provide some leverage between the growth in expenses and the top line.  We\u2019ll work to do that but it might not be quite as great as it\u2019s been historically, that\u2019s correct.", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital (USA)", "Then Doug, can you maybe just comment on a couple of end market dynamics, one you mentioned in your comments just recently that with respect to the announced mergers you don\u2019t expect many surprises kind of moving in to next year.  I\u2019m just curious kind of what your sales people are saying with respect to those mergers and what kind of gives you that confidence and maybe what\u2019s happening in the QAQC market there on a the pharma side.  Then the second question has to do with this merger yesterday or this acquisition of Agilent and Varian and just kind of what impact, if any, you see from that and kind of pricing expectations, I guess of some of the generic and CRO customers you mentioned are under cost pressures.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "On the big pharma side, we clearly saw a little bit of a slowdown when they announced the [sharing] merger for example.  But, subsequently we\u2019ve seen very good performance out of the two parts of that equation.  So, I think there\u2019s some initial question marks but [inaudible] question marks in parts of those business get kind of grid locked.  But, what\u2019s happened is these businesses have for five, six years now been living largely hand to mouth.  I think in various parts of the those businesses they\u2019ve realized that they just can\u2019t get more out of their equipment bases then there\u2019s a diminishing return.", "Plus, in our particular case ACQUITY continues to gain share of mind as well as share of market and I think partly what you see happening with us in those large pharma accounts is ACQUITY staying strong while other more conventional technologies suffer.  So, I really don\u2019t think if you look at that industry broadly there\u2019s too much more that they can [crawl] out of the [inaudible].  I think sooner rather than later we\u2019re going to see some pent up replacement demand and hopefully that pent up replacement demand moves to ACQUITY rather than the more conventional technology.", "In fact, we know that\u2019s happening in some cases, the question is does it happen more broadly.  If you look at what\u2019s happening in the analytical industry, the tool space, I think there\u2019s clearly companies that are going to want to look to buy sales.  I think you see some of that happening.  I frankly don\u2019t see how in the particular one you mentioned that the combined entity is going to be more competitive than the two entities on their own.  The smaller company wasn\u2019t a particularly competitor in the core liquid chromatography business.  I think they probably do more in the GC business than the LC business, not particularly bid in the mass spectrometry world.  ", "Obviously, they have a very strong position in MR.  So I don\u2019t see that changing a whole lot of competitive balance in the tool space.  Probably they\u2019re going to cut costs out of the combined entity and try to leverage their bottom line.  But, that\u2019s from reading the press releases so far.", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital (USA)", "Do you expect on the pricing though, I know that you said \u2013 I\u2019m just saying you have generic and CROs, some of the companies that could grow faster do kind of base their services on lower costs, what is your kind of share outlook there?  What\u2019s it been?  Do you think you\u2019ve been gaining, losing, staying equal in share?  ", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "[Inaudible] you\u2019re talking about Jon?", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital (USA)", "Yes.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume ", "Those accounts are interestingly some of the least price competitive accounts.  They\u2019re looking for time to market, they\u2019re looking for standardizing on the thing that gets them in to the market place the fastest.  So, if you look specifically in India there are some competitors who try to compete on price.  We still have the overwhelming market share and probably the highest priced provider.  I just continue to tell you that I don\u2019t see low price competition as being a key determinate of market share in our world.  It just has never been the case, on the fringe it does operate in some segments of the market but not largely in the areas that we focus on.", "Operator", "", "There are no other questions in the queue at this time.", "Douglas A.

The sense of optimism is somewhat tempered in the recognition that our customers overall spending levels have not yet enabled us to grow our top line, as these customers continue to deal with the effects of the global recession.", "However, it is our view that the weakest demand for advanced scientific instruments is most likely behind us and we believe we\u2019re poised to begin to see organic growth as we move into 2010. The Waters Division, to remind you our business that accounts for approximately 90% of our sales, shipment volume in the quarter was about flat with last year\u2019s result. This is an improvement in comparison to the mid-single digit declines that we saw in the first half of this year.", "From a management segment viewpoint, the declines that we saw in the quarter for our economically sensitive industrial chemical segment, were more moderate and declined at a mid single digit rate in comparison to the double digit declines in the first half of 2009. Our third quarter sales to the biopharmaceutical customer base, were consistent with a moderate declines that we saw earlier in the year.", "However, this result is encouraging in light of our significant back log build for new mass spectrometry instruments. Shipments to government in academic accounts were up in the quarter, despite a similarly, strong backlogs built for high end mass spectrometry systems.", "Geographically, sales growth in China remains strong and declines in India were less severe than we saw in the first half of the year. In America, Europe and Japan, revenues were generally balanced and stable in light of base border comparison dynamics. Government stimulus spending in the U.S. did not significantly contribute to sales volume in the third quarter, but we think we will begin to see this governmental spending impact our fourth quarter results.", "Looking at product lines for the Waters Division, our recurring revenue product lines, that is the combination of our chemistry consumables and services businesses improved in the third quarter in comparison to the second quarter result and grew in constant currency at a mid single digit rate.", "Instrument system sales for the Waters division declined modestly in the quarter as customers continue to delay instrument replacements, and to focus their capital spending on research purchases. Sales of our mass spectrometers and clearly chromatography platform grew in the quarter and we continue to build a healthy water back log for our technologically leading Synapt G2, a high resolution MS platform that we showcase at this year\u2019s ASMS conference.", "Researchers around the world are looking at our G2 Hdms system as much more than an incremental improvement to offer the technology platforms that have been introduced over the past few years. Customer feedback from scores of demonstrations of the G2, positively confirms that new levels of sample information are enabled by this new platform. They complement and expand the technological capabilities of their labs.", "The continued sales growth for ACQUITY UPLC Systems, even through these tough market conditions, indicates both its compelling performance advantage and an increased adoption level of UPLC Technology for regulated methods. We\u2019re confident that our successful implementation of UPLC Technology, our large and satisfied user base and our exciting future development plans, will allow us to maintain and grow our leadership position in this expanding segment of the chromatography market.", "For our TA Instruments division, a combination of strong growth in the prior year\u2019s base and continued weakness in industrial chemical account spending resulted in the double digit decline this business. However, within the TA instrument product line, demand for advance systems used to monitor biological processes is ramping up nicely.", "As we anniversary the on set of the recession and continue to benefit from innovative new launches from TA\u2019s research and development team, we feel we have a possibility to see better business results as we exit 2009 and move into 2010. Earlier this year, we announced the acquisition of Thar Instruments, the world leader in supercritical fluid chromatography, a separation technology closely related to HPLC that primarily uses more environmentally friendly carbon dioxide as the mobile base.", "As I noted in July, customers are increasingly interested in reducing chemical waste and running their labs in more green manner. As far as SFT technology in combination with the dramatic solvent savings enable by ACQUITY UPLC have allow Waters to assume a leadership position in cost effective and environmentally friendly laboratory technologies.", "We continue to look for acquisitions like Thar and will stay consistent with our strategy of targeting companies that are close to us technologically profitable and with top line potential to be accretive by overall growth rate. In the third quarter, acquired business added about two points of growth to our top line performance.", "Looking more broadly at our financial results for the first nine months of 2009, I\u2019m pleased by how well we have adapted to these most difficult end market conditions that we have ever experienced. Our global presence on the sales product development, manufacturing fronts has allowed us to access funded laboratory, accelerate new product launches and optimize our production costs.", "At the same time, we have effectively contained our expenses without compromising our level of customer support in our leading company image, factors that have contributed to our strong market position. For these results, I must thank the employees of Waters for their hard work and dedication during these very trying times.", "In a long run, we\u2019re confident that our end markets will rebound and I feel that our efforts to streamline our internal processes and leverage our global structure, during this recent down cycle has strengthened Waters and will allow us to deliver superior financial results with improvements in global demands.", "Before I turn you over to John for look at our financials, I\u2019d like to say a few words about our outlook. Historically, we have typically waited until our January call to discuss our next year thoughts. In general, we will follow that tradition today. However, as we are going through an unprecedented time of market turbulence, I feel strongly that the worst is behind us and that 2010 is more likely to represent a transitional year in which we experience a period of improving demand for Waters products.", "As we\u2019ve been formulating our budgets for 2010, we are planning our top line will begin to grow again. Not at our historical rates, but grow nonetheless. We\u2019re also prepared for some stops and starts as the recovery takes shape. To that end, we will start the year continuing our current pattern of conservative expense control until we\u2019re certain that it\u2019s somewhat smooth and sustainable business recovery is materialized.", "Philosophically, we will strive to grow our operating income at a faster rate than our sales growth, while we continue to drive faster earnings per share growth by deploying our strong cash flow for a continued share repurchase program.", "With that, I thank you for your attention and here\u2019s John with a more detailed review of our financials and guidance for 2010.", "John Ornell", "Okay. Thank you, Doug and good morning. Third quarter sales declined by 3% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.81 this quarter, compared to earnings of $0.79 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.79 this quarter compared to $0.71 last year. Our reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Looking at our Q3 sales results, sales were down 3% this quarter, with currency translation representing 1% of this decline. Looking at our sales growth geographically, and before foreign exchange effects, sales continued to be soft in the U.S. and Europe where sales declined by 3% and 2% respectively. In Japan, sales were down 8% versus a strong base of comparison, and sales in Asia outside of Japan grew by 4% against a strong base of comparison.", "Turning to the product front, within the Waters Division; instrument system sales declined by 6% and recurring revenues grew by 6% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales declined by 17% versus prior year. Acquired businesses gathered about two points to sales growth overall Now, I would like to comment on our non-GAAP financial performance.", "Gross margin, came in at 59% this quarter, which is down 30 basis points from Q3 last year. Gross margins came in stronger earlier in the year, and this quarter\u2019s slight decline is largely a foreign exchange dynamic associated with product mix. This quarter, we had fewer high end mass spec shipments, as we built a backlog of orders for our new Synapt G2 system, which we expect to ship in the fourth quarter.", "SG&A expenses declined 5% this quarter compared to prior year, as a result of our actions to control expenses and currency translation effects, R&D expenses declined by 3% this quarter as a result of currency translation effects on our expenses in our U.K. R&D.", "We currently expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be approximately 18.9%. This modest increase in our projected full year rate is the result of anticipated shifts of income into our higher tax rate jurisdictions. The impact of this change resulted in the operating effective tax rate of 19.7 in the quarter, or a $0.01 reduction in earnings per share.", "On the balance sheet, cash in short term investments total $578 million, and debt totaled $645 million, bringing us to a net debt position of about $67 million. On the stock buy back front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market. During the second quarter, we purchased 930,000 of our stock for about $48 million.", "We define free cash flow, as cash from operations plus capital expenditures plus non-cash tax benefit FAS 123 of our accounting, excluding unusual items. For Q3, cash flow was $102 million after funding $23 million of CapEx. CapEx expenditures this quarter included $4 million facility costs, related to our UTIS facility [ph] site.", "Accounts receivable, day sales outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up three days from Q3 last year, primarily the result of foreign currency translation and inventories were down modestly from Q3 last year, as we continue to adjust our manufacturing plants. As we look to the fourth quarter, we currently expect economic conditions to marginally improve as we move through the end of the year and then 2010.", "Four, we were selling days in Q4 will likely flatten out growth of our recurring revenue business in the quarter, but an easier base of comparison and marginally improving economic conditions should provide for better instrument sales performance. At this time, we expect overall sales before currency effects to be about flat in the quarter with currency at today\u2019s rate adding above 4% to sales growth in the quarter.", "We expect gross margins to remain strong and tight expense control will continue to contain SG&A growth in Q4. On the tax front, we currently expect a Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18.9%. In Q4 last year, we had a non-GAAP effective rate of 13.5%, which provides a difficult base of comparison this year.", "Free cash flow continues to be strong and will allow us to continue our share repurchases into the fourth quarter. We expect to exceed our original free cash flow budget of $300 million by $10 million to $15 million for 2009. For Q4 then, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.7 to $1.11 per share. For the full year, earnings for fully diluted share are then expected to be between $3.40 and $3.44. Doug.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. I think at this point, we can open it up for question-and-answer.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) For the first question, Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird, you may ask your question.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, Good morning and congratulations on a nice quarter.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thanks, Quintin.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "You kind of mentioned during the call a backlog of the high of end mass spec, has the G2 begun to ship now and could you touch a little bit about the backlog and your capacity to meet that back log?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, sure. The direct answer is the G2 has not begun to ship as of yet. We fully anticipate it will start to ship in the next few weeks. The interesting thing is that even though we don\u2019t have any G2s out in actual customer hands right now. The initial response has been a strong for a new introduction as we\u2019ve ever seen.", "So the backlog build is something we totally expected, because we knew we weren\u2019t going to be able to ship this until the fourth quarter and the third quarter build in this order rate is very encouraging. So watch this base for further notice, but we\u2019re very high on the initial reaction to the G2.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "So then the guidance that you gave for the fourth quarter really only assumes just about a month and a portion of a month of shipment for G2 then?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "That\u2019s right. Although, we anticipate shipping a fair amount of G2, as you appreciate the manufacturing process fees, a bolus goes into production and then all go on test kind of at the same time, that being brought up to shipment status. So while it\u2019s true we\u2019ll only get the equivalent of a month or month and a half that truly reflects a lot of instruments that were kind of in process for most of the quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t have you believe that what we wind up shipping in the fourth quarter is going to be a small amount. It is not going to reflect total full quarter output, but it will reflect a pretty representative sample.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Then with respect, you put out a press release a couple weeks ago about the FDA adopting ACQUITY for food testing. Is this similar to kind of what you saw in maybe emerging markets where governments maybe standardized and then with those regulations, maybe the suppliers then have to then start to think about conforming to what the Regulatory Officials are using?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "As you probably know, the whole area of food safety regulations is in a nascent stage. It would be wrong, because I think it\u2019s anywhere near like where the FDA is for testing drugs and there\u2019s a lot of things on the table now about how those regulatory agencies will evolve in the short term and who\u2019ll be responsible for all these regulations, but certainly it\u2019s a very encouraging first step, that the regulatory authorities are looking at our state-of-the-art technologies and kind of looking at that as a basis for what they can embody in the regulations. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re at the early phases of that regulatory process, but we\u2019re encouraged by it.", "Operator", "Pete Lawson with Thomas Weisel Partners, you may ask your question.", "Pete Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Doug, I wonder if you could talk through your ability to maintain operating costs into 4Q and 2010 and drive the operating margin line.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Certainly, Peter. I think it\u2019s a fair question, because, a lot of companies has included kind of responded to the initial signs of the downturn last year with significant constraints on spending. It\u2019s a fair question to say, how long can you restrain spending and expect to service your customers? I think the operating answer, is you should expect us to see constrained spending through the fourth quarter and through the first quarter.", "I think as we move into the second, third quarter and fourth quarter of next year again, somewhat dependent on the response to our new products. If we\u2019re right about the response, if we\u2019re right about the amount of capital that our customers will have available, you\u2019ll begin to see that spending take on more normal characteristics, but, I assure you that early on, we\u2019re going to keep a pretty strong governor on that spending sprang until we\u2019re more convince about the outlook for 2010.", "Again as I said, preliminary planning we\u2019re expecting an improvement next year. We\u2019re not expecting a V-shaped recovery. So, we\u2019re going to continue to be cautious until we get a little further into the year.", "Pete Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "John, I wonder if you could just give us some kind of breakdown on the effects on gross margins this quarter, the moving parts and expectations for 4Q.", "John Ornell", "The biggest issue with margins this quarter was really the fact that our high-end mass spec business, as we said really built backlog versus shipments this quarter. So from that perspective, we ended up capitalizing some of the variances favorable FX variances associated with production in pounds. You will see that turn around and come back to the P&L in fourth quarter as we ship those units.", "We had a little bit of a difficult base of comparison in the quarter as well. Q3 last year was actually our highest quarter for gross margins. It was a very good high end mass spec shipment quarter. So the basic comparison is a little more difficult as you look at it from a year-over-year perspective. I would say that for the fourth quarter, we expect to see an improvement on a year-over-year basis. As is the G2 begins to ship in some volume towards the end of the quarter.", "Pete Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Then just on this backlog you\u2019ve talked about. Can you give us some reference how large that backlog is versus historical?", "John Ornell", "It represents a couple to a few points of growth that have built into the backlog it\u2019s different than what we\u2019ve seen historically.", "Operator", "Ross Mukin with Deutsche Bank, you may ask your question.", "Mike - Deutsche Bank", "Hi guys. It\u2019s actually Mike in for Ross here. So it\u2019s been a lot of noise made about one of your competitors on a new UPLC launch. Have you seen any change on the competitive landscape since that product has gone to market?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Hi Mike. There have been a number of competitors who have been contending for some period about their competing ultra performance chromatography instruments. I would say for the most part, we\u2019ve seen very, very few if any of those actually show up in the market place. People have talked about launching it. As far as I know, no major chromatography competitor is actually officially shipping product yet.", "So it\u2019s hard to see in real terms, what the competitive dynamics are. We\u2019ve always contended that sooner or later some instruments would actually begin to show up. It\u2019s certainly been more of a case of later, rather than sooner and I think interestingly, as you know, we spent a lot of time with customers in our building here, going through technology seminars. Going through evaluations of what\u2019s going on in the market place.", "In just in the last two weeks, we\u2019ve had major pharmaceutical customers in our building here and have been hearing universally about how strongly they feel about our ACQUITY technology, and the fact that any competitive instruments are likely to take along time getting through evaluations and getting through approval processes.", "Whereas, ACQUITY has all gone through that process over the last, while since its introduction now five years ago, so we\u2019re still feeling very good about it, in current conditions, we\u2019re not seeing any competitive instruments actually be sold, that could change, but I think it\u2019s a future event not a current event.", "Mike - Deutsche Bank", "Then again on the ACQUITY front, Doug, you did mention that you\u2019re seeing, increased UPLC adoption. Can you give a little more color in terms of where the increased adoption is coming from and whether there\u2019s actually trends showing broader use of the total platform?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019m sorry, Mike, you got clipped a little bit, could repeat that question?", "Mike - Deutsche Bank", "I\u2019m just curious about whether you\u2019re seeing improved broader trends of the ACQUITY platform into different market areas?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, it\u2019s interesting with ACQUITY. To refresh you, traditionally, ACQUITY has been most successful in the research and into the early development stages of company processes. It\u2019s been very successful as a front end for mass spectrometers. Given it\u2019s the physics involved care.", "What we\u2019re seeing in a number of placements were made into methods developed Ross, kind of the people who set the standards for downstream instruments and things like biopharmaceutical labs. We\u2019re now seeing a clear up tick in interest in the regulated applications, meaning into QA/QC laboratories that have a very high volume of usage of instrumentation.", "We\u2019ve always kind of known that this is going to be the secondary applications, because these labs are slower to convert, but what we\u2019re seeing is the productivity that now it\u2019s proven with ACQUITY. The environmental friendliness, the savings and solving consumption all are adding and we\u2019re now seeing the very clear beginning of that adoption period in the regulated applications.", "Mike - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan, your line is open.", "Sung Ji Nam - JP Morgan", "This is Sung Ji Nam in for Tycho Peterson. Thanks for taking the question. As we look toward 2010, could you comment on kind of what the key drivers are for the recurring revenue portion of your business? You kind of commented on the instruments given the new product cycle, but could you comment on kind of how we should think about what the key drivers are for recurring revenue as we look ahead. Thanks.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, I think clearly we saw this year some inventory reductions across the world and our customers who are major users of our chemistry. We also saw frankly, some customers move off longer service contracts, trying their best to save money, wherever they could. Both of those dynamics we see clear evidence of them letting up and in fact reversing as we go into the last part of this year and into next year.", "We\u2019re seeing customers come back on service contracts. As they realize that they\u2019re better off getting regular service out of their installed base, rather than pay higher time and materials charges, it\u2019s kind of penny-wise and pound foolish there.", "In the chemistry side, we believe that we\u2019re even currently seeing a modulation of that inventory effect. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing people rebuild inventories, but we\u2019re seeing probably the end of the inventory reduction phase. Particularly, in some of our areas that have traditionally held higher inventories like India, we saw some pretty significant inventory reductions early in the year and we\u2019ve seen that modulate as we move through the year.", "I think those two dynamics are likely to lead to better comparables in 2010. I think with economic activity, we\u2019ll see some baseline improvement in usage of chemistry, but at this point, we\u2019re not going to bank too much of that early on in 2010. That\u2019s an area as I talked about where we\u2019ll probably have to prove to ourselves that\u2019s underway before we build that into our budgets.", "Sung Ji Nam - JP Morgan", "Also just a quick question with regard to your combination LC GC/MS, is that an interesting opportunity for you guys kind of in items of where you might put additional investment, or could you kind of comment on that, talk about that business?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We are the GC/MS piece of our business as always been a relatively small and focused piece, with our very high end, inorganic mass analyzers. So it\u2019s a meaningful, but not terribly significant part of our business and overall, you should expect us to be principally focused on LC/MS applications.", "Sung Ji Nam - JP Morgan", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley, you may ask your question.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "So, question on, I apologize if this has been asked before, but I was wondering if you could give us a little more granularity around exactly what to the FX sort of headwind was in GM for the quarter? How we can think about that developing. I know you talked about qualitatively, but any numbers would be helpful.", "John Ornell", "If you look at the gross margin pieces, the significant pickup that we had seen earlier in the year in the first half was largely currency. We talked about it being two-thirds to three-quarters depending on the quarter. Principally, all of that favorability turned around this quarter as the mix of business moved away significantly from the high end to max spectrometry shipments.", "We also had a higher proportion of our European sales that were U.K. based. Our U.K. business actually did very well on the quarter as the expense of some of the other geographies. So that the margin mix unfortunately with that was negative. So all of the favorability that we had with the foreign exchange really turned around in the quarter. A lot of that like I said, was inventory and it\u2019s going to come back around and provide, you know, maybe about a 50 basis point type of a benefit, by the time we get to the fourth quarter.", "On a full year basis, we are still pretty much on plan as it relates to where we thought we would be from a gross margin perspective. It\u2019s the build of the G2 and the slight mix change, where we had more U.K. business in the mix in the third quarter this year that turned the FX dynamic around for the quarter.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Rob Hawkins with Stifel Nicolaus, you may ask your question.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes. If you don\u2019t mind, could you guys maybe go a little downstream for us and talk about what the strategy is for the food testing QA/QC, approach to your Asian markets. How this kind of the lower end strategy, what changes you guys expect in the landscape there?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019m sorry, when you talk about the lower end strategy, Rob?", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "Well, I mean I want talking, I guess not proteomic so much as more the line on QA/QC testing for the food service business?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Okay. The food safety business has been a pretty robust area for us for awhile now. As you remember, the Asian and European segments of that probably have led the way with stronger regulations for imported foods as well as things focused on genetically modified organisms. So we\u2019ve been at the forefront of the food testing area in those geographies for awhile now.", "You will recall that last year, the melamine issue in China was very hot right now and right through the end of the year and we did a substantial amount of business because we\u2019re able to quickly get to market with a test for melamine. So it\u2019s a robust area. It\u2019s nowhere near as big for a world wide today as the biopharmaceutical applications, but it is growing.", "It\u2019s growing in those areas of the world and it shows great promise to be a faster growing application in the United States. The United States is struggling with how to regulate this area. Who\u2019s going to be responsible for regulating it, but clearly there are regulations that are going to be here.", "We are very active in the whole area and trying to make sure that our views are considered in this and I having the feel like we\u2019re in an excellent position to take advantage of this evolving market place, but I think that\u2019s going to be an area of that\u2019s going to be the next two or three years as you\u2019ll see that expand. The serve market will still be larger outside the United States.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "I\u2019m sorry, I guess I\u2019m having trouble connecting the dots between what the FDA announcement is and then maybe how you connect from some of the higher end things you\u2019ve been doing and then down streaming the technology or taking that and I guess, dumping it down into what you\u2019ve already kind of built out in Asia on a food strategy standpoint. I mean is that part of the strategy or is it more bringing Asia up to a higher level?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Rob, the FDA has acquired a great number of the ACQUITY\u2019s principally for drug testing.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "I\u2019m sorry. Again I misunderstood.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Obviously, our commercial accounts view that and say, poise of the regulators are beginning to see what can be evaluated using UPLC technology, it has a follow on effect down the road for those industrial accounts having to adopt faster that technology and I think that\u2019s something that we anticipate will lead in the QA/QC market to a faster adoption rate, because the regulators are looking hard there.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "My apologies, I misread what the comments were and then just real quickly, I may have missed these comments. What is your take on the NIH awards and what this in a lot of these proteomics awards and what this may mean relative to the new products?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Are you referring to stimulus spending, Rob?", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, I am.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think a number of us in the industry are kind of looking at extraordinary quote rates for stimulus possibilities and if you ever thought that those quotes were all going to come to fruition, we\u2019d all be probably celebrating with alcoholic beverages right now. I think it remains to be seen. We think that there will be some significant orders placed on stimulus spending, but it\u2019s still largely a fourth quarter, first quarter, second quarter event. There\u2019s no question that the quote activity has been extraordinary.", "Measured in the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars, I personally don\u2019t think all of that\u2019s going to come to fruition. So you have to look at people who are trying everything but the kitchens sink in those submissions.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "There\u2019s enough quality in there that it would be wrong to think that some significant business isn\u2019t going to come out of it, ", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We preferred to think about it in terms of the low single digit effect on our growth rate probably in the fourth and first quarter.", "Operator", "Jon Groberg with Macquarie, you may ask your question.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "Just a quick question, can you maybe comment Doug on replacement sales. I know that\u2019s been a business was been just down. Doesn\u2019t sound like it gotten much better in this quarter. Is there any reason to believe in terms of what you\u2019re hearing from customers or anyone else that some of this could come back in 2010?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "There\u2019s no questions it\u2019s what we considered replacement business that\u2019s been the most under pressure during this timeframe. Companies that just sit at their normal cycle was replacing on six or seven or eight years, if that would stretch that out a year in many, many cases. Now that cost them in throughput. Cost them in higher repairs and maintenance, but there\u2019s no question that they can do that for a short period of time.", "I think, the best way to characterize it is, if you go back to the early 90s. Particularly in the last healthcare governmental scare, we saw particularly our pharma customers go through a very similar dynamic. Long out their replacement cycles and look at really putting off making capital improvements.", "Then once that got behind them, we clearly saw pent up replacement demands begin to shake itself through and we saw a period of three or four years of catch up replacements in those applications. I see no reason to believe that we won\u2019t see some similar kinds of dynamics. Whether it happens early in 2010, or it has to wait a little bit longer, I don\u2019t think that the physics has changed.", "These instruments are going to wear out. They need to be replaced. We\u2019ll see the down time begins to tick up on them and the demand for new technologies begin to click in. So, I think, we well could see some of that next year, as we go into 2011.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "Last question, if you think about kind of the portfolio of technologies that you have and the cash that you\u2019re generating I know a lot of that\u2019s going to buy back shares. Is there any reason to think, are there any technologies or adjacencies or things that you might be looking at to also put that cash to work in?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We\u2019re always looking. I think the compelling kinds of things that if we look at tend to be smaller, rather than larger. So while it\u2019s never impossible, that we wouldn\u2019t deploy our capital, in a larger framework. In general, that hasn\u2019t been the case and there\u2019s nothing that we look at today that says, if we deployed a major sum of capital in a particular area, that in a reason timeframe, it would accelerate our growth rate or accelerate our returns.", "We continue to look at some of these smaller niches oriented that do exactly that, they have the potential to accelerate our growth rate, be accretive to our earnings, improve our return on capital and do that what\u2019s left over with our stock where it is today. There\u2019s no question that our stock is a very good investment continues to be immediately accretive and poise is a good place to spend your money, I think it continues to be a very good investment for us.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "Perfect. Thanks.", "Operator", "Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird, you may ask your questions.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Thanks for the follow-up. Just some clarification, so on the fourth quarter guidance when you talking about, is that zero percent organic offer of Q4 and 4% FX. Is that right, John?", "John Ornell", "That is correct.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Then acquisitions, what should we be expecting?", "John Ornell", "Acquisitions will be a couple of points, but, days in the quarter will take away a couple of points. So you\u2019re still back to kind of the zero if you will include all of that.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, so constant currency is zero?", "John Ornell", "Correct.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Okay and then FX had 4%. So net 4%?", "John Ornell", "Correct.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Got it, great and then with respect to kind of your comments on 2010. Historically, Waters has been in that kind of high single digit, low double digit organic. So I know this is maybe a little early to talk about 2010 guidance, but I mean is that kind of implying that you budgeting now to assume kind of low single digit, mid single digit type of organic revenue growth in 2010?", "John Ornell", "Yes, I think it would be fair to say that\u2019s the neighborhood that we\u2019re looking at starting out the year Quintin. Now I\u2019d say that and there\u2019s a reason why we normally don\u2019t want to do this until we finish the fourth quarter and we\u2019re a little bit further I had and that\u2019s because there are a number of factors that could make that look conservative.", "We\u2019ve got a very conservative base this year that we\u2019ve come off. We\u2019ve a very strong new product year in front of us. We\u2019ve got low interest rates. We have got a very much improving FX scenario, but we still have some companies that are in tough shape. How much capital will they have? That\u2019s a long winded mealy-mouthed way saying and there are upsides and there are downsides, but having said all of that, I think that mid single digit area doesn\u2019t feel bad to us at this point, as we look forward.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you so much, guys.", "Operator", "Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company, your line is open.", "Brigermen \u2013 Cowen & Co", "Hey, guys. This is Brigermen [ph] in for Doug. Thank you for taking the questions. Most of them have been answered, but quickly on geographies. First in the U.S. to follow-on Rob\u2019s stimulus question, you mentioned kind of some backlog to Synapt and you start to expect some stimulus beginning in Q4. Is there a similar backlog dynamic there? You guys kind of getting ready to ship maybe multiple products heading into the fourth quarter?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The only real backlog dynamic we have, Doug, is the G2. That we clearly knew we\u2019re launching to the market, taking orders, and would not be shipping until the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s the only product that creates a significant backlog dynamic for us moving from the third and to the fourth. Now as it relates to stimulus spending, I\u2019m not quite sure what your question was, what was that?", "Brigermen \u2013 Cowen & Co", "I guess based on the orders you said there are some big numbers out there for orders. Are those kind of beginning to come through and I guess begin to start in the fourth quarter?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, what I said was we\u2019re seeing quotes. So these customers who are putting in for grant money, request a quote for you and they will say what will it cost me for a G2 configured in a certain way, and we monitor those quotes and so they go principally to NIH labs and to university in academic areas and those numbers frankly are huge. We\u2019re quoted millions and millions of dollars of quotes on those and many of those are likely to come through, we know that not all of them will come through.", "So they\u2019re not in backlog as such. They haven\u2019t actually been reduced to an order or commitment to buy, but they\u2019re one step previous to that. We\u2019ve always monitor our quote rates, and typically they run in a consist manner. The stimulus spending is result in this huge bolus of quotes and it remains to be seen how many of those quotes actually get reduced to orders and to shipments, but\u2026", "Brigermen \u2013 Cowen & Co", "In OUS, guys talked about a good quarter for the U.K. and it\u2019s potentially some restocking in India and looked like Japan might have been down. Can you maybe just a one-liner on a couple of those different end markets and maybe if things are turning in different regions or continuing in certain directions?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think the U.K. is the significance of our mass spec portfolio. Our mass spec business has been headquartered in Manchester in the U.K. So the customers in the U.K. tend to get early looks and then are very responsive to our new product. Not only the G2, but the full Xevo product lines, that\u2019s been very encouraging, because as you know the U.K. isn\u2019t generally in very strong economic conditions right now.", "So that\u2019s been strong. I think some of the other areas have been strong, but the large other countries in Europe haven\u2019t been particularly strong underlying dynamic. That being France, Germany they actually negative growth, so all in Europe has been okay, but it\u2019s been a little bit skewed towards the U.K.", "In India, we clearly saw slow conditions start around this time last year. That the strength of the Indian currency or I should say the weakness of the Indian currency plus the economic turmoil, resulted in a lot of insecurity in India. We\u2019re beginning to see that turn, I think, in the third quarter. We think that that gets better quarter-by-quarter. Because certainly the Generic shipments coming out of India, plus the potential for other drugs going off patent mean that\u2019s the underlying dynamics the India, we think are still pretty secure.", "We\u2019ll return to a pretty strong growth environment. China continues to be very strong, as one of our strongest areas in the world and that even considering that we saw some melamine business begin to really ramp up at this time last year. Melamine really hit in the fourth quarter, so we\u2019re going to have some very tough comparisons in the fourth quarter, with China, but I think absent to that kind of one-time blip, China continues to be diverse, remarkably strong.", "We\u2019re in excellent competitive shape across our product lines in China. Even in Japan. Japan, was a flattish kind of quarter, but we may be seeing some initial signs that Japan has some opportunities for growth. Not taking it to the bank, but there is some encouraging early signs in Japan.", "Brigermen \u2013 Cowen & Co", "Just one quick one and then I\u2019ll get off. With regard to the AV Synapt divestiture, are you seeing maybe a potential opportunity there for market share pick up in the mass spec business and just maybe a comment on that move?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Frankly, we\u2019re always trying to gain market share. That\u2019s goes without saying the any time of a business like that, changes hands, of course customers may be disrupted. You never know. I am sure they\u2019re trying their hardest to keep everything smooth for their customer base, but facts are oftentimes face a little disruption when you change owners.", "We think much more important, is the fact that our technology is as strong as it has ever been, we\u2019re always planning to make this year a very strong introduction for us across many of the applications. The competitors have been stronger in traditionally and I think we\u2019re in the best position that we\u2019ve been in a long time to make significant inroads in that. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s specifically related to that competitive situation. It\u2019s just more a statement of where we think we are in our product cycle.", "Brigermen \u2013 Cowen & Co", "Just doesn\u2019t hurt. Okay, thanks guys, I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Isaac Ro with Leerink Swann, your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Good morning, guys thank you for taking the question. If I could just ask to start here, wanted to see if you could maybe talk about what your seeing in the broader pricing environment within former and specifically you said we should maybe consider any disruptions in demand either through sort of changes in the budgetary process within those customers and/or the availability of used equipment in the marketplace. I know it\u2019s historically a small market, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s potentially a short term disruption there as, a lot equipment is made available in the secondary marketplace?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019ll turn it over to Art, but in general, we haven\u2019t seen too much. Number one, we are the price leaders. We have always been the price leaders and as you can see from our gross margins, there\u2019s been no disappointment coming as a result of significant price competition coming into our infield, but, Art really runs that segment of the business. We\u2019ll ask him to comment on specifically has any price dynamic coming into play in the major segments of our infield.", "Arthur Caputo", "Yes, interestingly enough, we will see customers hold off and differ before we will usually see them back off too much on price. They equate price and capability and so we fortunately for us, particularly in a regulated market. They don\u2019t seem to be willing to make the tradeoff or take a risk for a lower price.", "In the end they have a feeling that, they\u2019ll have to end up re-buying it if they make a mistake, you\u2019re better holding offer and going with what their test specified. Very little risk taking we see on behalf of customers in the way of trying to take shortcuts. They will keep the equipment they have and extend the utilization and then when they have to replace they will replace.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Your second part of that question, Isaac was on the secondary market. People selling used equipment. Was that just be your second part?", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Yes. I know it\u2019s historically a smaller market, but I\u2019m just wondering in extend what you see the changes in the availability of that channel in terms of meaningful volumes of products?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Art, you seeing much of that\u2026?", "Arthur Caputo", "The only thing I would say is that to the extent of some of the larger accounts, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, probably the only made at the station of that is, if they take one plant, they\u2019ll a equipment and move it to another plant and so those be shipped assets around.", "While there\u2019s some secondary market to be honest, it is not enough for us to even, we really don\u2019t see it and therefore we find customers are usually reluctant to cope with the ordeal of having to figure out how to handle warranty and serviceability and traceability. So it\u2019s something we don\u2019t run into very much.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "You\u2019ve always seen a little bit of it kind of in parts of the market that we generally don\u2019t play very strongly in. Some of the low end academic situations, some of the more traditional industrial accounts, particularly in lower, the less global accounts, but frankly we\u2019re not really seeing it, as I said, pop-up in any of our traditional Waters customer base.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Okay. Thank you and then just secondly, wanted to maybe get a better appreciation for the advantage you guys have within ACQUITY for the chemistry portfolio that you have and maybe highlight if you could, a few of the areas where you made investments, maybe more recently and that you think kind of gives you a material advantage over a new entrants in the coming quarters?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Let me see if I hit it right and then, Art can embellish but a key strength of our ACQUITY platform, has always been that the whole technology was driven by a proprietary chemistry configurations that we designed really the instrumentation, coming from the invention of the chemistry. So, we\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a very high level of tying of the chemistry to our instruments. The instruments in the field are almost totally using proprietary Waters chemistry in their applications.", "When we launched ACQUITY five years ago, we basically had one flavor of chemistry and the five years with dramatically expanded the flavors in the configurations of that proprietary ACQUITY chemistry and that flood to certainly the highest growth rates in our consumables business around ACQUITY and for every new ACQUITY that we place, is almost that guaranteed razor and razor blade that now goes along with it, with the ACQUITY model.", "So we are continuing, we\u2019ve launched new acuity flavors in 2009, we\u2019re going to launch more in 2010 and that continues to be a very significant part of our ACQUITY strategy. Did that cover the flavor of your question?", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Actually a little more color there would be great in terms of maybe if you could talk about what in pharma specifically, is there an appreciable percentage of chemistries that are maybe entirely proprietary or customized to that getting customer to extend does that creates that much higher switching costs for them?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "No, there\u2019s nothing really proprietary to a particular customer. Our chemistries are all broad purpose, useable and by any customer in most any application. They\u2019re tailored to a specific application, you may want a particular activated chemistry for a particular compound that you\u2019re looking for, but that could be used by anyone in the customer base.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Operator, I think we probably have time for two more questions.", "Operator", "Certainly, [Derek Duberlyn] with UBS; you may ask your questions.", "Dan - UBS", "Hi, this is Dan in for Derek. John as one of you could just break out these FX impact on EPS for the quarter?", "John Ornell", "It didn\u2019t even round to a penny, so it was zero.", "Dan \u2013 UBS", "With the close of the Pfizer deal, do you have any comments on the resumption of quote and order activity if any and whether this has been in line with expectations and also historical norms for deals of this size?", "John Ornell", "You mean resulting from the merger?", "Dan \u2013 UBS", "Yes.", "John Ornell", "Yes, we don\u2019t have specific status. I mean we\u2019re not seeing any dramatic difference from what we\u2019ve seen historically. They always go through a period of confusion, of who\u2019s going to be their boss. Frankly, we\u2019ve continued historically in the last couple of years sharing has been probably stronger coming off a base than Pfizer had been. We probably see a continuation of that currently.", "So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a dramatic falloff. I think we\u2019d anticipate that the future combined entity probably is a somewhat better environment than the past nine months.", "Dan \u2013 UBS", "Perhaps just a comment on maybe outside the large pharma accounts, what you\u2019re seeing with some of the smaller customers in CRS?", "John Ornell", "Did you say large pharma\u2019s or small\u2026?", "Dan \u2013 UBS", "Yes, outside of large pharma, that\u2019s the contract resorts organizations in a smaller accounts in general.", "John Ornell", "I didn\u2019t say, this quarter we saw probably a little bit better activity in the smaller specialty, CRO business than in big pharma, but it\u2019s not so dramatically different than it\u2019s worth highlighting too much.", "Dan \u2013 UBS", "A lot of big pharma softness was associated with G2 backlog too so?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes.", "Dan \u2013 UBS", "Okay, but with those accounts fit were there was some sequential, because I know you say it was fairly weak or at least weaker than large pharma last quarter so, sequentially it was improved?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes.", "Dan \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Chris Arndt with Select Equity Group, you may ask your question. Please check your mute button. We\u2019re not able to hear you.", "Chris Arndt - Select Equity Group", "Thank you, if you already addressed this I apologize. Could you comment on how the consolidation activity in the pharma industry has affected recent results and how you expect it may affect results going forward?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "That\u2019s essentially the question that just got asked concerning Pfizer and sharing. We have seen some slowdown in business as a result of it. Nothing that we haven\u2019t seen in the past and we say that, in general we think the next 12 months should be marginally an improvement in that climate versus the last 12 months, but frankly we have seen good activity on the part of the targets in these areas, probably less strength out of the parent organization. So you wrap up the lousy economic conditions and kind of it\u2019s hard to tell, which is the chicken and which is the egg here, but I think we feel like the future is likely to be marginally improvement on what we\u2019ve seen in the last 12 months.", "Chris Arndt - Select Equity Group", "Okay and I expect that what you seen in the CRO industry, it\u2019s been relatively slow. Is there any change in that or do you have a comment on the CRO customer base?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "No. I think that CRO business has been flattish. We have probably done better than those accounts feel like they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re under a lot of pressure and, I think long term that CRO business starts to curve upwards. Although it may take awhile, but right now that business is pretty flat.", "Chris Arndt - Select Equity Group", "Okay. Great, thanks.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for taking the time and we appreciate the quality of the questions and we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you again next quarter.", "Arthur Caputo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference.

(Operator Instructions) I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter and full year financial results conference call. With me on today\u2019s call is John Ornell, Waters Chief Financial Officer, Art Caputo, President of the Waters Division and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "As is our normal practice I will start with an overview of the business highlights. John will follow with the details on our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the first quarter and the full year 2010.", "Before we get going, I\u2019d like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John Ornell", "During the course of this conference call we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, at this time for Q1 and full year 2010. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. ", "For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 part one under the caption Business Risk Factors.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update prediction regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2010. ", "During this call we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning.", "In our discussions of the results of operations we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income per Diluted Share included in this morning\u2019s press release.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you John. Well, for Waters 2009 I think as you all realize was a very challenging year. The year of course started with a high degree of uncertainty in the midst of a global financial crisis, severe recessionary conditions. It was around the mid point of 2009 the uncertainties for our markets began to abate a little bit and a more stable but significantly weaker demand pattern emerged.", "During the second half of the year demand appeared to remain fairly stable with some indications that certain segments of our end markets were potentially seeing a modest level of recovery. These second half dynamics continued through the fourth quarter and we find ourselves entering 2010 somewhat optimistic that our end markets will improve, but continuing to feel that the recovery may be slow.", "Fortunately we were able to see storm clouds building in late 2008 and we adequately anticipated end market weakness as we designed our 2009 business plans. ", "Early in 2009 steps were taken to tightly control spending while continuing to support critical growth programs including new product introductions. Now, with the year behind us we can appreciate the results of our business strategy as we were able to grow our earnings, generate strong free cash flow and introduce exciting new products in this most difficult demand environment.", "If you look at the fourth quarter, our sales and earnings came in roughly as we had expected with currency neutral revenues just under flat and our earnings per share up 5%. Geographically, our revenues were largely in line with our expectations.", "Moving down the P&L our profitability remains strong due to favorable currency translation, disciplined pricing and continued tight expense control.", "On the product side, we began shipping Synapse G2 mass spectrometry system in the fourth quarter. As you will recall, this new technology system was showcased at the ASMS conference earlier in 2009 and was quickly well received by the scientific community as offering novel capabilities for a wide array of applications.", "In fact, the order ramp for Synapse 2 during the second half of 2009 was stronger than for any previously introduced high end mass spec instrument from Waters, even without significant governmental stimulus orders in the U.S., a topic I\u2019ll come back to a little later.", "On the chromatography side, Acuity UPLC continued to displace HPLC system sales and now represents our most popular chromatography platform. In our view, recent competitive introductions in the UPLC product space corroborate the technology and will help accelerate the conversion of the overall LC market to proven sub two micron particle chromatography as pioneered by Waters.", "Looking at customer segments in the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of the trends from earlier in the year. The weakest segment was the chemical industry, a business that\u2019s about 15% of our overall sales. The declines that we saw in this segment were less severe as we anniversaried the onset of the weakness that began in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Our TA instruments division has a large exposure to this industrial segment as many of their customers are involved with production of materials that find their way into automobiles and other consumer goods.", "Within our TA division we saw a more moderate decline in the sales for the quarter and order flow dynamics suggest that the demand was strengthening in the quarter. These data suggest that we likely saw the low point of demand from industrial chemical customers in mid 2009 and that a modest recovery has started to materialize during the past few months.", "Demand from our pharmaceutical customers modestly improved in the fourth quarter. Factors contributing to increased demand include a rebound in sales in India and small improvements in demand from CRO and generic firms.", "Sales to our larger pharmaceutical accounts declined modestly in the quarter. Acuity and IN mass spectrometry continue to account for the growth in pharmaceutical demand but we have yet to see the onset of a return to historical rates of instrument replacement.", "Waters sales growth in applied markets including food and environmental testing were affected by the significant business we transacted late in 2008 associated with Melamine testing primarily in Asia and Asian countries. Factoring out the effects of these sales, the applied markets represent a growing business for Waters.", "Our sales to government and university labs were flat with last year. However, this result does not fully reflect the demand we saw in the quarter as we built an order backlog for multiple synapses two systems.", "Interestingly, our orders and sales in the quarter did not include meaningful activity from U.S. governmental stimulus money. From our perspective, the funding of these programs has been delayed and will likely influence our business by mid 2010.", "We remain optimistic that the strength of our research product offering such as our Synapse G2 and Divo Platforms will afford us a fair share of stimulus related spending.", "I\u2019d now like to focus on new product initiatives that will impact our business in 2010 and beyond. Earlier this year I discussed with you our new mass spectrometers including the Divo Series of bench top instruments and our exciting Synapse Q2 HDMS and MS systems.", "Through 2009 orders and sales for these systems have ramped very nicely and we have entered 2010 with considerable business momentum. Installations of Q2 systems in the fourth quarter proceeded smoothly and we look forward to presentations at this year\u2019s AMSM conference in Utah that will highlight the performance and advantages of G2 technology for a wide range of applications.", "2010 and should be an exciting year for Waters and mass spectrometry. As some industry participants work their way through new management structures, and sort out new strategies, we plan to execute our established product and market plans. Our focus will be on continuous innovation and in 2010 we plan to introduce new mass spectrometry systems that will push the performance envelope while broadening the attractiveness of MS technology to a wider base of customers.", "On the chromatography front, I\u2019ve spoken to you about the dramatic impact of Acuity UPLC on numerous occasions and earlier this morning, I mentioned that UPLC now accounts for most of our chromatography shipments.", "Since introduction in 2004, Acuity has allowed hundreds of organization around the globe to realize improved data quality, increased sample throughput and reduced costs per analysis. With all the proven benefits of Acuity UPLC, many have been quick to embrace UPLC technology.", "However, many more have been attracted by the promise of UPLC but remain reluctant to change largely because of their comfort level with existing HPLC systems and techniques. In our industry there is no substitute for working with thousands of UPLC customers to gain insights for product improvements and the ideas for next generation systems and it\u2019s in that light that I want to tell you about our new Acuity UPLC H Class system that we\u2019ve just introduced this week.", "Working closely with our customers, we saw the need to provide a bridge to UPLC performance that builds upon the wide spread knowledge and comfort laboratories have with HPLC operation. We feel that Acuity UPLC H Class is this bridge and it has been designed to fulfill the needs of mainstream customers, especially those working in method development and routine analysis laboratories.", "It does this by combining UPLC performance with the operational familiarity of traditional HPLC, a combination of high performance and simplicity that we believe will facilitate adoption by a broader range of industries, applications and operators, all of whom will realize the scientific and work flow benefits of UPLC.", "I encourage you to visit our website for a detailed description of our new Acuity UPLC H Class as well descriptions of our complete family of application Acuity Systems.", "Before turning you over to John for a more detailed review of our financials, I want to share some thoughts about 2010 and reiterate some of our key business strategies.", "Looking at the competitive landscape of the strength of our product portfolio in 2010, I believe that we\u2019ve never been in a stronger product position. Our strategy of focusing on our technological strengths and staying close to our customer base has allowed us to protect and growth our market share and deliver superior financial results even in these difficult economic times.", "2009 was one of those difficult times and yet we were able to grow our earnings per share and introduce exciting new products. I believe that 2010 will be a better year for Waters than 2009. Most signs suggest that the worst of the recession, in our markets at least, is behind us and that demand for our products should increase.", "However, we feel that there is ample reason to manage our business cautiously as we are not expecting a dramatic change in economic conditions and do expect that there may be some lumpiness to the recovery.", "Accordingly, we will continue to manage our expenses closely while we follow a proven plan for the deployment of capital. ", "In 2010 we will continue on the path of globalizing our manufacturing operations that further balances our production capacity with global demand patterns for our products.

Fourth quarter sales increased by 3% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.12 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.07 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.08 this quarter compared to $1.01 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Looking at our Q4 sales results, sales were up 3% this quarter with currency translation providing four points of growth. Without the benefit of currency translation, sales were down 1% versus prior year. Acquired businesses added about two points of growth this quarter.", "Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales in the U.S. and Japan were up 1% and 7% respectively. In Europe sales declined by 5% and in Asia, sales were down 3% against a strong base of comparison which included shipments related to Melamine testing requirements in 2008.", "Turning to the product front within the Waters Division, instrument system sales were flat and recurring revenues due to fewer selling days this quarter declined by 1%. Within our TA Instruments Division, sales declined by 7% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our non-GAAP financial performance. Gross margin came in at 60.3% this quarter which is up 140 basis points from Q4 last year. Gross margins benefited from favorable product mix, product cost reductions and foreign currency translation.", "SG&A expenses increased 6% this quarter compared to prior year and R&D expenses increased by 1%. ", "Our full year operating effective tax rate came in at 18.4%, down modestly from Q3 as a result of a shift of income into lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, Q4\u2019s pre tax income was effective at 17.1%.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short term investments totaled $630 million and debt totaled $632 million bringing us to a net debt position of $2 million.", "On the stock buy back front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market and during the fourth quarter we purchased 907,000 shares of our common stock for $54 million. For the full year, we purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $210 million.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any non cash tax benefit from FAS123 accounting and excluding unusual non recurring items.

For the full year, free cash flow was $341 million after funding $94 million of CapEx and adding back $5 million of FAS123R benefits and excluding $12 million of payments associated with a litigation provision and lease settlement.", "Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 67 days this quarter, up three days from Q4 last year and inventories were up about $5 million from year end last year, largely due to currency translation.", "Looking at 2010, we currently expect economic conditions to marginally improve as we move through the year. Geographically we expect that Asia will continue to see overall favorable business conditions and provide solid growth in 2010. In the U.S., Europe and Japan we expect to see gradual improvements across the area as these geographies begin to lift out of recession and grow modestly in 2010.", "Product wise we feel we have a strong line up across our technology platforms and are well positioned in our end markets as we begin the year. From a customer segment perspective, we expect 2010 to see sluggish performance from our industrial base customers, mid single digit growth from our broadly defined pharmaceutical customers and near double digit growth from our government and academic customers heavily affected by stimulus spending.", "Overall this should provide for mid single digit growth before currency effects. Currency at today\u2019s levels should add about a point to sales growth in 2010. Currency comparisons to sales growth for the quarter we base the comparison will start off more favorable early in the year and become more difficult as the year progresses.", "Now I would like to comment on our expectations for non-GAAP financial performance in 2010. Gross margins were heavily affected by foreign currency translation in 2009 which will provide a difficult base of comparison this year. We currently expect margins to start off the year at around 59% and end the year over 60%. These more difficult currency comparisons will provide slower than average EPS growth in the first half of the year.", "On the expense front, our efforts to control costs during 2009 again creates a difficult comparison and while we will continue to be cautious on spending, we currently expect that SG&A and R&D will grow at about the same rate as sales as we make modest investments to support growth in our businesses, specifically in our Asian geographies.", "On the tax front, during 2010 we anticipate upward pressure on the tax rate from continued success of our high end mass spec products manufactured in the U.K. and downward pressure from the transfer of additional production to Singapore.", "At this time, these effects look to principally offset each other and we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at around 18.5%.", "A continuation of our buy back efforts should provide for a full year of fully diluted share count of around 93.5 million shares. Interest costs are expected to rise somewhat this year and we expect to have about $12 million of net interest expense in 2010.", "Non-GAAP EPS for the full year 2010 are currently expected to be between $3.70 and $3.85 per fully diluted share. ", "Free cash flow is expected to remain strong and should approach $400 million in 2010.

John, what was the day\u2019s impact in the quarter particularly on the consumables business and how many days did you lose year on year?", "John Ornell", "There was a few days difference. As you might recall at the start of the year we had an extra three days in the first quarter and that principally turned around in the fourth. It\u2019s probably three or four points of consumable service, mostly consumable growth that was impacted, one to two points of growth overall down in the fourth quarter which we picked up in the first.", "Ross Mukin \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "From a more macro perspective, you talked about the idea that you\u2019re not looking for a substantial recovery from any of the industrial players or any sort of meaningful kick in particularly on the chemical side. We\u2019ve seen chemical company results improve fairly significantly. Today we had one of the big players putting up some pretty decent results. In terms of the conversations you\u2019re having with these organizations broadly whether it\u2019s within TA or within the Waters business, is there any sign of hope there or is there just a belief that they\u2019ve built out so much capacity the last few years there\u2019s not really a need for instrumentation?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "First of all I think you\u2019re right. As we\u2019ve said, I think we saw the lowest point in these industrial companies in the mid point of the year and it\u2019s been marginally better since then. We also have the fact that the first half of last year was so weak that we think the first half of the coming year is going to better simply because of that base dynamic.", "I also read the DuPont news morning. They seem to have clearly turned the corner there. That\u2019s a good sign.", "TA also saw some underlying improvement in terms of the attitudes of their major customers, their quote rates and in fact, their business rates, so that is a pretty good barometer of the industrial marketplace and they\u2019re feeling cautiously optimistic that that\u2019s continuing as we move into the new year.", "So I think there are some good signs. We also see counter signs that they\u2019re very tight with their capital spending. I still think we\u2019re going to see a lot of these big companies in both industrial arena and pharmaceutical arena be slow to open the purse strings in the new year and they\u2019re probably going to wait as it\u2019s become somewhat traditional a little on in the year before they see any major capital releases.", "Ross Mukin \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "As you look back historically, what\u2019s been the sign to say that okay, it\u2019s safe to get back in the water in terms of some of those industrial players from a CapEx perspective and was it two consecutive quarters of GDP growth? Is it six months post the original inflection point in GDP? How should we think about what we need to see from an economic data point perspective and from a top in perspective from some of those players when they actually start to spend?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019d say its six months data on GDP growth. The auto industry is such a big player in the basic chemical production in a lot of these companies and what\u2019s going on in auto clearly went so low and now is coming back. But what the total dynamic is with these large chemical producers is hard to call and overlay into a normal recession.", "So I think the worst of that is clearly behind us but whether the six months rule will hold or it could be a little faster, it could be a little slower.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "With respect to the H class, could you talk a little bit about the timing of the release now instead of waiting and your expectations in 2010? How much expectations of adoption have you built in and how much of the cost going out and promoting this have you also baked into your SG&A?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We\u2019ve baked in all of the cost of promotion and the cost of training. Some of that actually happened in the fourth quarter as you would expect because in order to introduce it now, we had to have fulfillment literature and training etc. all in place to be able to launch this.", "You can clearly hear our excitement over this new system and we do think it is a very important, exciting launch. On the other hand, I also have to tell you, we\u2019re being fairly cautious in terms of the net overall impact on our business.", "So there\u2019s clearly a little bit of a dichotomy there because we have to look at cannibalization. We have to look at the speed of the uptick and so I suppose it\u2019s fair to say we talk a little bit out of both sides of our mouth here. But trust me that we really think this is an important introduction and an important system for us.", "Typically, the way companies and Waters business mode in some years past is that you\u2019re really struggling to get a new product to pick on and a typical launch pattern is, you\u2019ve got the product, you\u2019re confident about being able to ship it sometime at the end of the first quarter, you launch it, but you\u2019re still struggling to build inventory and to get the product out there, so you don\u2019t have a very strange order pattern that you can\u2019t fulfill at the end of a quarter.", "But that\u2019s always a struggle and trust me, over 30 years in this industry, we\u2019ve talked about it enough and talked to competitors enough to say that\u2019s a pretty typical pattern.", "What we do with the H Class is the total fulfillment is done. The training is done. Inventories are now ready to ship and we\u2019ve actually begun to take real orders for the H Class. This is very unusual for a launch of this magnitude so that\u2019s why we launched it when we did.", "It was ready. We\u2019re ready to ship it by the end of the first quarter. We\u2019re not going to be in a position to have a large build backlog. Art\u2019s chastising me in the background here when I said by the end of the quarter. Orders taken now will ship in 30 days. That\u2019s our quote pattern.", "So we\u2019re very comfortable with it. This launch pattern has been as smooth and as on time as I\u2019ve ever seen in my history here. So we have high expectations. You don\u2019t necessarily see that because of this whole level of confusion in the economic pattern and some of our customers, so if we\u2019re right, I think long term this is going to stimulate our growth rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "A question about pharma; in your comments you talked about mid single digit growth from pharma for this year and in this quarter it looks like large pharma was down a little bit more modestly, so can you talk as to how you\u2019re thinking about pharma and what\u2019s behind that mid single digit growth expectation for this year?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We\u2019re expecting it will improve over the fourth quarter. We clearly saw some weakness in the large pharma\u2019s going through mergers. That was probably a little bit more pain than we had originally expected and so we\u2019re anticipating that will improve a little bit in 2010. Early indications are that that will be the case, but it\u2019s still a forecast at this point.", "Was there a second part to your question?", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Can you talk a little bit about consumable growth for 2010 and how you\u2019re thinking about that both with Acuity and if you could comment on what consumable pull through will be like on the new UPLC system.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat that?", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "You\u2019re outlook for consumable growth for 2010 and any color you can add on consumable pull through on the new UPLC system.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The consumables outlook is mid single digit growth. It should be a more, we shouldn\u2019t have the calendar irregularities in 2010 that we had, although we still have the fact that we had the first quarter of last year with the outsize number of selling days, but the calendar itself in 2010 is pretty consistent.", "So right now we\u2019ve got a very strong launch pattern in new chemistries, particularly in the new Acuity product line that we\u2019re very enthusiastic about and we think that should deliver that mid single digit growth rate.", "In terms of the new system, the great advantage of the H Class is that it allows customers to adopt UPLC at their own pace and allows them to run the traditional system, methods the way they wanted to at the same time being able to lead them on to the greener pastures of UPLC capabilities.", "To the extent that they adopt UPLC, we\u2019re highly confident that they will be buying our UPLC chemistries. To the extent that they run HPLC methods, on of the advantages of this is that they can run their existing chemistries. So if they\u2019re on Waters chemistries, they\u2019re likely to continue to run that.", "Probably in the early phase of this, it probably doesn\u2019t dramatically change market share dynamics in the consumables business. In the later stages as we think this movement to UPLC it should improve the growth rate even further in UPLC chemistries.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Going back to the original question on pharma spending, is more the growth you\u2019re going to see in pharma from standardization with Acuity across QAQC and application areas?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Don\u2019t forget that pharma spend, when we talk about pharma, we\u2019re talking about the all in pharmaceutical industry including India, including generics, including CFRO\u2019s. We saw an improvement in the India generic marketplace in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re pretty confident about seeing a consistent sustainable return to the strong business in India as we go forward.", "We\u2019re also seeing generally a stronger condition in generics and in the CRO marketplace. So those are probably more significant to us in terms of maintaining growth in pharma than the large pharma dynamic.", "Don\u2019t forget that for years now we\u2019ve been seeing reduced business in the large pharmaceutical that kind of moved into the generic and the specialty pharmaceutical segment of the market.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "On your spending guidance, SG&A and R&D growing at kind of the same rate as sales; can you talk about your ability to adjust that as needed throughout the course of the year. Do you feel like that\u2019s kind of an active approach that you\u2019ll be taking, or how do we think about that?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think we\u2019ll have to continually monitor it. We act like a lot of companies. Out of the chute, we\u2019re reluctant to commit to too much head count addition until we see how 2010, is it really going to shape up the way our plans have it. So I think we\u2019ve got some flexibility early on.", "I think one of the hurdles we face as a lot of companies do I think is that we reacted so quickly and took significant steps to sustain our profitability in 2009 that it was unlikely that you continue all of those steps as you move forward into 2010.", "The dynamic of that is, you have to make up some ground in terms of salaries, merit increases, commissions, that you took out in 2009. So structurally you\u2019ve got more of a hurdle as you go into the new year than you did last year. We think we\u2019ve accommodated that. We think we can manage our way through it, but it does make it structurally more difficult than we saw early on last year.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "On the Synapse backlog, can you comment on how that impacted margins if at all?", "John Ornell", "We talked about the synapse in the fourth quarter being somewhere between $10 million and $15 million of shipments. It was in fact in that range. In spite of that we did fill backlog within the quarter for that particular product and it was a little bit accretive to margins but not that meaningful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "On the new Acuity H Class, this is really a modification of an existing platform. Is that being built in the U.S. or is that something you can now with this type of launch fast track that to Singapore?", "John Ornell", "Are you asking about where it\u2019s manufactured?", "Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, it\u2019s modifications. I understand it\u2019s a modification of the existing Acuity platform, I guess kind of streamlined and before you\u2019ve had the best practice of engineering, building here, refining the product and then moving it abroad. But this type of modification for some of these more mainstream customers, does it give you the ability to start to process over in Singapore where it\u2019s a little bit more cost effective.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Actually the H Class with our experience now in moving product, new designs, the exciting thing about the H Class and what enables us to position it in the marketplace at its value point is that it will very quickly for all intents and purposes, it will be manufactured in Singapore out of the chute.", "So that was exactly our strategy and that experience that we\u2019ve had with Acuity alliances and the historical ramp ups that enabled us to do that.", "Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Can you remind us what type of product line, what products are being made over in Singapore and how that\u2019s benefiting gross margin? Is that something you can disclose?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019d tell you that principally all of our HPLC products are manufactured over in Singapore. A lot of the detectors even for the Acuity product line are manufactured over in Singapore, so it\u2019s better than half of our production there and the movement of this new technology will certainly tilt the scale significantly towards the majority of the LC production being done in Singapore.", "Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "You also mentioned further globalization. Do you think that will be Greenfield production facilities or do you think this is going to be through acquiring adjacent platforms?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The globalization we talked about in terms of manufacturing, we have no plans to open up new manufacturing sites. Our expansion will be within the existing platforms that we have principally in Singapore and Ireland. As you know, our R&D in the initial runs get done in either Milford or Manchester or Delaware, and then typically get pushed out into Ireland or Singapore.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "I was wondering if you could comment on the [Triasiac] and where we stand on that platform.", "Arthur Caputo", "We introduced the product not last\u2019s ASMS be the ASMS before hand. To be honest we did in fact run into some technical difficulties with the chemistry platform. Progress has actually been quite excellent in the last quarter and we fully anticipate to begin delivering product and actually exceeding the claims on the product by ASMS this year.", "", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "In terms of the H Class, in terms of how it manufactures into the pricing environment for the existing QE and broader HPLC market, how should we think where it\u2019s positioned versus those pre existing products?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The H Class, if you think about three ranges of product, you have an HPLC at one end of the price spectrum. You have the current Acuity that we\u2019ve had in the marketplace at the other. Think of this as being between 25% and a third higher than an HPLC in terms of its relative price position in the marketplace.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "", "Sort of a big picture question, I think there was an initial body language out of Washington this morning around State of the Union and how we might see a freeze in discretionary spending items going forward. Clearly the stimulus benefit right now helps but maybe looking past that, do you have opinions on what the government funding outlook might look like in that kind of environment and specifically what you think your contacts hope that it might continue to power upwards even in a flat budget environment?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Typically the growth in the NIH budget or flatness in the NIH budget is very hard to see the impact on our underlying business. It obviously exists. It gets dispersed in terms of NIH grants so in the long run it\u2019s always better for us to have the NIH budgets going up. But the kind of environment that\u2019s described, of course we both know that it\u2019s easy to proclaim a price or a budget freeze. Whether it actually happens or not remains to be seen.", "But assuming that it does, I think it won\u2019t be very noticeable in our operations, certainly not in the first half or the first three quarters of this year. But it\u2019s rank speculation to think what they actually will do to this budget and when it will occur.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jennifer Lu for Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Jennifer Lu for Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "My question is on gross margin. I was hoping you could just walk us through the drivers of your gross margin guidance and what takes it progressively higher through the year?", "John Ornell", "If you look at 2010 versus \u201909, it\u2019s down modestly overall for the full year principally associated with a less favorable foreign currency environment. The 59% starting point in the first quarter is a portion of the starting point is the fact that we have much lower volumes going through the first quarter than the fourth so you traditionally see this business start off with a somewhat lower gross margin and with a much higher gross margin in the fourth quarter.", "So the significant delta year over year is all currency and as we ramp the products that we\u2019ve talked about introducing first here, but ultimately in Singapore, we\u2019ll get more of a gross margin pick up as the year goes on and then in the fourth quarter with the volume lift that we expect to get with the budget flushes that exist at the end of the year pushes the margins well over 60%.", "So the absolute difference year over year is the foreign currency dynamic and then it\u2019s mostly a volume and a new product cost reduction type play as we make our way across the quarters.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Just remember as John talked about the foreign currency dynamic, the principal reason for the foreign currency effect was the very weak British Pound in the first part of last year and since we do a significant amount of manufacturing in Pounds that lowered the cost of our U.K. manufacturing and improved margins.", "The British Pound has strengthened since that point although it does bounce around a little bit. Where it is right now in terms of Pound costs higher than it was in the first quarter of last year so that\u2019s why this foreign exchange affect early impact.", "John Ornell", "Overall, we\u2019re actually pretty pleased about how we manufacture in local currencies as well as make sales in local currencies. It kind of balances our overall foreign currency exposures, but in that one margin line issue, it does swing from year to year.", "Jennifer Lu for Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I was wondering about service margins relative to last year. To what extent is this discretionary spend in terms of building out your infrastructure there?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "There\u2019s no doubt we\u2019ll be adding at some level service head counts as service grows in 2010. Some of those heads are going to be internationally based, not quite as expensive perhaps as here in the U.S., so there will probably be a slight decline in those service margins, but you\u2019re not going to see a precipitous drop as we make marginal investments there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Derik deBruin \u2013 UBS.", "Derik deBruin \u2013 UBS", "I want to talk a little bit about column utilization and basically you said UPLC instruments have basically outpaced placement of HPLC\u2019s. What is going on in the consumable dynamics? I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out just in the fact that you have longer pull through on both platforms right now and particularly how do you look at the dynamic given that the column of longer life in the HPLC, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what the, and how the H Class figures into this whole method of looking at your consumable stream.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Let me give it from 30,000 feet and John can jump in at any altitude that he wants. Don\u2019t forget, consumables is a complex picture for us which is sample prep devices, traditional HLPC columns as well as Acuity.", "Unequivocally Acuity columns continue to grow at a very strong pace so our model here that we have more of a razor and blade model with UPLC is clearly playing out. What we\u2019re seeing in terms of our overall consumables business in 2009 is much more related to fewer samples being run in the traditional marketplace, inventories coming down in the sample prep world particularly in places like India where they dramatically reduced inventories.", "We\u2019re beginning to see some sign that\u2019s turning around but I think 2009 was a pretty aggressive inventory management cycle. So I think Acuity consumables are playing out largely the way we modeled it and very positively but it still represents a smaller piece of our overall consumables market that our more traditional products and our sample prep products.", "Derik deBruin \u2013 UBS", "Along those lines, I know some of your competitors have introduced UPLC columns. I guess what that is but I would assume because you had the first Acuity columns out, do you still command the lion\u2019s share of your consumables stream platform. What feedback have you heard from other people offering other UPLC columns? Do they perform as well on your instrument and what would make somebody choose a non Waters Acuity column?", "Arthur Caputo", "If you think about the introduction of lathes system, we had a couple of challenges. We\u2019re taking HPLC which ran at 3,000 PSI up to as high as 15,000 PSI and we\u2019re taking the columns particle size down from three microns, five microns down to sub two. So the big question in the world is how can you maintain the robustness of the system.", "So when we designed both the Acuity instrumentation and the column, they were designed hand in hand. The instrumentation contains capabilities that actually monitor the column and it\u2019s what has given the Acuity columns the reputation of being equal but in even more cases, more robust than the traditional UPLC column.", "The column itself has electronic devices that actually connect to the Acuity system. It tells you what\u2019s going on in the system. It tells you what\u2019s going on at the separation. So think of this as a fully integrated system.", "The traditional HPLC column was a free standing device. It got connected. There was no real system based interfacing between the column and the system. The customers immediately realized this and the psychology in the marketplace right now is that there is no viable chemistry alternative at this time that gives you this whole system\u2019s approach.", "And even those companies that are coming in trying to sell instrumentation, for all intents and purposes the viable approach of trying to attach an Acuity column to their system, but they lack all the documentation, the information, the element that has made this combination so powerful in the marketplace.", "So for the moment we\u2019re finding very high compliance. Column utilization for Acuity run greater than 90%. The traditional HPLC for almost everybody in the marketplace, 10% to 20% of your columns are used on your system because of the long term availability of all sorts of different columns.", "We\u2019ve really changed the game in this marketplace and at least for the moment, it looks like its going to get stronger before it gets weaker.", "Derik deBruin \u2013 UBS", "The mid single digit growth in the consumables and some low single digit growth instrumentation is probably a good way to look at the full year?", "John Ornell", "Instruments I think will probably be close to mid single digit growth too. Certainly with the new high end mass spec, we\u2019re pretty excited about growth opportunities for the overall mass spec business and I think this new launch that we\u2019ve got here too, should be able to push LC close to mid single digit growth as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowan & Company.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowan & Company", " In the context of 2010 sales growth guidance, how much do you expect new instruments including G2 and the H Class to contribute? Is that going to get you a point or two or is that too high or too low?", "John Ornell", "I think if you look at our first mass spec I would say that the mass spec market should continue to turn around and perform better. I would think that the high end G2 is likely to move our mass spec growth a few points perhaps overall as it continues to hopefully grow near double digit as we make our way across the quarters. Certainly the early indications based on order backlog and customer interest would suggest that\u2019s true. ", "On the LC side I would say that Acuity even in a poor year, 2009, grew nicely and I think this transition product that we now have that really begins to help people transition from HPLC to UPLC should expand the base against which we can grow our LC products. It\u2019s hard to say what cannibalization will be of perhaps some of the HPLC products, but I think net net , looking at the new product  driving at least some single digit growth for HPLC, for LC in total makes sense.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think it\u2019s a lot complicated by market dynamics but if you think one to two points for the H Class and one to two points for the G2, that wouldn\u2019t be far off of what our thinking is.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowan & Company", "In terms of G2 backlog, can you talk a little bit about how that differs across end markets and geography?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "In our major geographies, the orders were pretty balanced in terms of our overall geographies and we try to be very fair in terms of what we were shipping across those geographies. Of course you can imagine our field was screaming wanting all of it for their territories but we basically parceled it out pretty ratably across the geographies.", "", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowan & Company", "Some of your peers have asserted that the visibility on the big pharma end market would improve as the mergers start to close. Is that your view and has that started to happen yet?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Visibility is such a nebulous term. We certainly saw less business from those birched entities in the fourth quarter. We had planned on some of that. It was a little big lighter than we had expected. ", "We don\u2019t expect it to be quite that bad going forward, but I wouldn\u2019t say that the visibility of their budgets and their spending pattern is significantly better than traditionally at this point of the year.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowan & Company", "I guess the hope would be as it typically does that it would get better over the next quarter or so?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes. I think traditionally what we\u2019re seeing not only from merger companies is that they\u2019re very slow to release their capital and yet their scientists are all just screaming for increased capabilities. So you\u2019re trying to sort through the noise to get at the signal and sometimes one takes control and other times, the other.", "I do think there\u2019s pent up replacement demand in a lot of these companies. We fully expect that over time we\u2019ll see business reflect that pent up replacement demand but we didn\u2019t see it in the fourth quarter.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowan & Company", "On the industrial end market, if I remember correctly in Q4 of last year the industrial weakness was actually more pronounced within the Waters division, not the TA division. I just wanted to see how that affected year over year comparability in the fourth quarter of this year and moving forward. Is it Q1 where essentially the comps get pretty favorable from the industrial end market within both divisions?", "John Ornell", "Yes, you\u2019re right. We saw a little bit more of a lag with TA interestingly on that front and Q1 does become the easiest compare of the year for 2010 and as Doug said earlier, just given some of the early indications from this group of customers, we\u2019re expecting that we\u2019ll probably begin to see some positive momentum from that group in the first quarter as we begin 2010.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowan & Company", "Across both divisions?", "John Ornell", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Patrick for Peter Larson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Patrick for Peter Larson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "I was wondering, U.S. stimulus seems to be delayed a bit. You didn\u2019t see too much for sales materialize in 4Q. You now see the majority of the impact in mid 2010. How much slower are funds trickling in than you expected and what are customers citing as the primary reason for those delays?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think a lot of people maybe including us were hoping more than determining in terms of the stimulus spending. I think a number of these grants were affected by different administrative procedures. They had different finalization, different review committees that were set up by technologies so they had to go through separate routes in order to get approved spending.", "That might be why you see some elements of technology getting a little bit earlier releases than others. We\u2019re told that particularly the mass spectrometry reviews have largely been completed and that those authorizations are in process and we should begin to see orders late in the first quarter into the second quarter. ", "Whether you see orders that can be fulfilled and make their way to shipment, probably that\u2019s more second quarter weighted rather than first.", "Patrick for Peter Larson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "In Japan, what was the primary drover of the growth acceleration in the quarter?", "John Ornell", "Japan had a reasonably good mass spec quarter so some of those G2 shipments made their way to Japan.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "It also had a pretty weak base in the fourth quarter of last year. You\u2019ll find that to be a fairly consistent dynamic in 2009 in certain territories, but mass spec and a weak base combined to give Japan a pretty good quarter.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "", "If we look at Q1 as where most of the visibility is, but is there anything going on as you saw trends in Q4 that would make you think that it would be any different from historical seasonality now that it seems like economic activity is at least somewhat stabilized albeit at lower levels if you think of sequential, the seasonality between Q1 and Q4 of previous years.", "John Ornell", "I would say certainly starting off Q1 last year was a pretty dismal environment so from a basic comparison perspective you would certainly argue we have a relatively easy base. That being said though, as Doug pointed out earlier, it\u2019s hard to believe that customers are going to allocate funds very early on this process to spend.", "But it would say a mid single digit expectation of growth given that base of comparison and given some of the early signs that we\u2019ve seen in demand volumes would be a realistic place to begin.", "We do have on the one hand additionally this new product launch. We\u2019re taking orders. We\u2019ll be shipping on that front as well, but we need to be a little cautious and transition to that new product. So I think there are a number of factors on one side or the other that I think wait, come down to a mid single digit expectation is a realistic place to be based on the run rates we see coming out of the fourth quarter.", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "On the acquisition front, was [inaudible] was the only acquisition related revenue, is that correct?", "John Ornell", "That\u2019s right.", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Any update on the integration with that business? It seems like revenues were a little bit higher than they may have been thought or forecast by others?", "John Ornell", "I would say the integration is well under way. The volume from that acquisition was roughly on plan. It wasn\u2019t a full two points so it wasn\u2019t quite as strong but I would say the expectation certainly going forward in 10 is to see some meaningful growth out of that organization having spent a lot of this year getting it ready to go.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We clearly are in the process of kind of Waterizing the systems offering. Still for most of this year it operated more or less as a stand alone operation. But I think we fully expect benefits on a number of fronts to come in the coming year as we integrate it more fully into the Waters organization.", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "On the H Class I think you mention it was going to be priced around 25% higher than HPLC. Can you talk about the pricing environment on HPLC? Was there any degradation given the new products that have been launched by competitors and where that instrument is stalling out and maybe just pricing in general?", "John Ornell", "When I was talking about pricing of the new product, I think we meant to say that the Acuity has about a 20% premium to HPLC and the new product only has about a quarter of that premium. So it\u2019s 5% to 7% higher, something of that ilk is the HPLC. So it\u2019s a modest premium to go from HPLC to the new H Class, and then there\u2019s another more significant premium to go from the H Class all the way up to the research grade product that we\u2019re currently selling.", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "And then generally pricing on the HPLC, has that been pretty stable or has that kind of come down a little bit?", "John Ornell", "It\u2019s been very stable.", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "If you think about there was pretty strong demand of a few years. You come off of this fairly significant recession. What\u2019s your comment around excess instrument capacity generally on the analytical instrument front and what should we be expecting from new products in order to, you broadly talked about some new product lines throughout the year that we should be thinking about to drive that replacement that you talked about that you think there\u2019s some pent up demand. What\u2019s going to make people determine that they have to replace some of the instruments?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think importantly on the market front, what I believe is that it\u2019s becoming harder and harder in the separations industry, particularly liquid chromatography from many secondary or tertiary suppliers to keep up. ", "It\u2019s very hard to imagine that in the long run they can invest the money to compete across this line on both the engineering requirements to provide UPLC. More and more the data requirements, particularly the important integrated HPLC and UPLC data with mass spectrometry data, so the competitive issue I think really make it tough, and I expect that you\u2019ll see that over the next couple of years.", "That\u2019s not to say all competitors can\u2019t do that. There are a few who clearly can. But I think it does mean that the strong get stronger, so I think that has a competitive impact in the industry.", "I don\u2019t think in terms of capacity, the capacity in this industry isn\u2019t bricks and mortar. It\u2019s much more of a product cycle capacity than it is, and I think we are at the front end of that cycle right now.  I think we\u2019re in good shape. ", "Jonathan Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "You had mentioned that there was pent up demand to replace some of the instruments, presumably when they do so they need a rational for doing so, so I\u2019m wondering from a new product standpoint what we should be thinking about for the year in terms of where and what types of new products to expect.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think the rational, if you think about big pharma and you think about their need to do more for less, they\u2019re under a great deal of pressure on the labor front. The great advantage of UPLC is that in many of these high volume applications, you can replace two or three instruments, traditional instruments with one of ours.", "And now we\u2019re going to give them the ability to make that transition much easier by starting off on a HPLC and quickly using the same instrument to ramp up to UPLC\u2019s capabilities. So I think it\u2019s a product that fits dramatically well with the needs of our customer base.", "Now to be fair, Acuity did some of that, but it wasn\u2019t easy to make that transition in these regulated applications, particularly in QC. We think that\u2019s what H Class does extraordinarily well and should motivate a more rapid transition in these high volume applications.", "I think the other thing that you\u2019re going to see this year, certainly from us is a continuation of this continuous improvement in mass spectrometry. The G2 is not the last innovative mass spec that you\u2019re going to see from us in the next 12 months and the technological playing field probably moves more attractively for us as we get through 2010.", "We\u2019ve got a number of industry participants who are going through their own structural reassessments or merger activity on their own. I think all in makes us a more, I think the competitive environment is tilted in our favor a little bit more in 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Kind of building on what you said here I think it\u2019s kind of interesting. Would the mass spec platform that you build off of, maybe into some of these other end markets, would that be more on side or is this something that you might take the prior G2 and create a more mainstream platform? What\u2019s your expectation?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think you should expect that our high end orthogonal top we\u2019re going to drive the G2 further and probably not see anything revolutionary on that front, but I think you should look more towards the quadruple space in 2010 to expect that we\u2019ll have some exciting things coming forth there.", "Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Would it be a fair assumption that the announcement you made about Taiwan and our own FDA relative to some of the quadruple buying there that we may see more of those down the road?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019m not quite sure what you\u2019re referring to in terms of Taiwan.", "Robert Hawkins \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "They did, they bought both the LC and quite a few of the systems, for the food, the FDA\u2019s and more government entities.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We continue to think particularly in the food safety and those applied markets that they\u2019re robust, particularly robust outside the U.S. and we\u2019re hopeful that the conditions and the regulations build momentum inside the U.S.", "Of course with all the spending freeze talk and whether they\u2019re going to pass new regulations on food safety in the U.S., that\u2019s not a big serve market today. We\u2019re hopeful that that becomes a bigger market going forward, but that remains to be seen.", "Thank you all for staying with us over a long conference call and we look forward to talking with you again at the end of the first quarter.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(Operator Instructions) I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter financial results conference call. With me on today\u2019s call are John Ornell, Waters Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, President of the Waters Division and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "As is our normal practice I will start with an overview of the quarter\u2019s highlights. And John will follow with details on our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year and then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A.", "Before we get going, John will cover the cautionary language.", "John Ornell", "During the course of this conference call we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, at this time for Q2 and full year 2010. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.", "For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 in part one under the caption business risk factors.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for July 2010.", "During this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning.", "In our discussions of the results of operations we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income per Diluted Share included in this morning\u2019s press release.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you John. Well, our results in the first quarter I think signify continued improvement in customer demands and also stronger reacceptance of our key new products. But we\u2019re not totally prepared to believe that the economic conditions that have challenged industries since late 2008 are fully behind us. We are increasingly optimistic about our business prospects for 2010 and are very excited about out strong product division.", "The difficult business conditions in 2009 required us to improve our operational efficiency and with these efficiency still in place improving end markets in 2010 should allow us to transition toward our more traditional sales growth rates in 2011 and beyond.", "Turning to first quarter 2010, our organic sales growth with 6%, and we delivered 9% adjusted earnings per share growth. And however more important, we executed well on our new product initiatives most notably, our new Synapt G-2 and our H-Class ACUITY UPLC systems.", "Demand for our Synapt G-2 has been strong and we successfully delivered and installed the record number of Synapt class mass spectrometers in the first quarter. Sales of new Synapt instruments was strongest in North America, Europe and Japan. Key application areas of Synapt continued to be in proteomics and metabolite identification. However, we have more recently begun to see uptake by customers in organic synthesis and central analytical labs and pharmaceutical, academic and industrial accounts. ", "On decision to introduce the H-Class ACUITY UPLC early in 2010 helped to drive order growth in LC instrumentation an important. Our H-Class UPLC system was designed based on consistent customer feedback regarding key performance features required to accelerate UPLC uptake and regulated testing applications.", "As you may recall we introduced this new instruments configuration in late January and gained customer shipments in early February. Though significant new launches often result in the delay of orders as customers reevaluate and modify their purchasing plan to adequately consider a new system offerings. Our positioning of the H-Class appears to have resulted in a little disruption of our sales momentum while setting the stage for an acceleration of the equity business as we move through 2010.", "Some of our largest equity users, companies that have globally deployed UPLC instruments through the development organizations have told us that they are now more confident of transferring UPLC technology throughout their quality control labratories.", "For many this new outlook is based upon new H-Class instrument features that allow for the running of legacy HPLC methodologies while providing an easy upgrades path to UPLC performance. With the introduction of the H-Class, overall interest in UPLC has significantly increased. We see this in seminar attendance and requests for customer demonstration and then our lead and quotation volumes. Most interesting we have started to see new orders in sales from competitive uses. We have been motivated to try small particle chromatography but it has not been sufficiently confident to move forward until they learned about our new H-Class UPLC.", "With in our Waters division recurring revenue sales that is the combination of our service and chromatography chemicals businesses performs about as expected and grew in the mid single-digit range. We expect this trend to continue through 2010 with the chemicals business growing a bit faster than the service business.", "Sales of our TA Instruments division grew a little faster than those for the Waters division with strong performance across TA lines of thermal analysis, rheometry and biocalorimetry systems. Given TA\u2019s heavy exposure to the economically sensitive chemical industry its sale growth and even stronger double-digit orders growth are indicative of the recovery and our industrial end markets and as TA\u2019s continued strong product positions. ", "Business activity for TA as indicated by sales leads and quotes for new instruments appears to be continually improving and sales growth for the division is likely to accelerate in future quarters. Sales to industrial accounts for the Waters Division were also positive in the first quarter. We have historically included sales to the chemical, food and environmental testing industries within our broadly defined industrial segments. Within these sub-segments chemical and environmental sales were strong in the quarter, while food testing growth was effected negatively by a strong Asian Melamine Testing business in the base quarter\u2019s comparison. Pharmaceutical segment sales in the first quarter grew at about the same rate as our overall sales growth. We look across the segment and we benefited from a recovery of sales to generic firms in India and strength globally from generic CRO at specialty pharmaceutical accounts. ", "As we expected merger activity among certain our larger pharmaceutical customers affected their purchases from us in the quarter. However, we are encouraged that recent feedback from some of largest accounts indicated that an instrument replacement cycle, especially in light of our their excitement from our ACUITY H-Class UPLC launch maybe on the horizon. ", "And look at our business geographically, sales in the quarter was strongest in Asia with India and Japan driving the lion\u2019s share of the improvement. As you will recall, last year we endured a very difficult first half performance in India as a severe devaluation of the rupee helped depress demand for dollar denominated laboratory instruments. In Japan, strong sales to academic institutions primarily for research mass spectrometry systems resulted in solid double-digit revenue growth.", "Our sales growth in China was consistent with our overall mid single digit sales performance and was as I mentioned earlier affected by strong Melamine sales in the 2009 quarter\u2019s results. Factoring the Melamine business out of the quarter\u2019s results sales would have been up a strong double-digit rate. And that\u2019s an encouraging factor to consider as Melamine related comparisons should not be a factor of future quarters.", "Looking ahead towards the second quarter and full year 2010 will be an exiting year for new product launches, I\u2019ve already reviewed the ACQUITY H-Class introduction and I am pleased to now tell you that significant new mass spectrometry base systems are planned for the upcoming ASMS conference in Salt Lake City. We expect that this year\u2019s ASMS will be just as exiting as last year\u2019s when we showcase the Synapt G-2 HDMS system. With the improving demand pattern that\u2019s emerging this year and our commitment to overall cost containment, we\u2019re expecting another year of strong free cash flow.", "As we have for the past several years, we\u2019ll continue to deploy our cash to its smaller acquisitions and our share repurchase program. They are off to a strong start in 2010 with a $100 million deployed for stock repurchases in the first quarter.", "So in closing I would like to say that we are encouraged by the trends that we see developing in 2010. Furthermore, we are confident that with our strong product portfolio and broad access to growth markets, we are very well positioned to benefit from a continued global economic recovery and for an ongoing opportunity to deliver industry leading top line and bottom line performance.", "Now here is John to take you through more detailed financial analysis. ", "John Ornell", "Thank you Doug and good morning. First quarter sales increased by 10%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.81 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.74 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings was $0.79 this quarter compared to $0.75 last year. ", "A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning. Reviewing Q1 sales results compared to Q1 last year sales were up 10%", "this quarter with currency translation representing 4% of this increase.", "Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. and Europe were up 2% sales within Japan were up 22% and the sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%.", "Turning to the product front within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 7% recurring revenues grew by 6% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments Division, sales increased by 8% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q1 non-GAAP reported financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance was larger than originally anticipated this quarter and came in at 60.3%, the company continues to benefit from manufacturing cost reductions and more significant foreign currency translation benefits than expected.", "The combination of the relative strength of the yen and weakness of the British pounds versus the U.S. dollar had a beneficial impact on our gross margin percentage based on our geographical sales and production mix. We experienced a similar and even more pronounced currency impact in Q1 of 2009 and this accounts for the year-over-year decline in gross margin percentage.", "Going forward, the 2009 base of comparison becomes more favorable and we expect to see year-over-year growth in gross margin percentage in future quarters. SG&A expenses increased 8% this quarter compared to prior year and R&D increased by 10% this quarter as we prepared for new product releases later this year.", "Income taxes came in on planned of about 18.5%, we are on track for the transfer of additional LC production to Singapore later this year which helps to lower our tax rate, but the success of our Synapt systems manufactured in the UK puts upward pressure on our effective tax rate. Our present view has not changed from January and we expect these effects to principally offset each other and then our full year effective tax rate will remain around 18.5%.", "However that is depended upon many new product introductions and manufacturing transfers that could bring some variation into the picture as yield unfolds. On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $692 million and debt totaled $712 million bringing us to a net debt position of about $20 million.", "Earlier in the quarter, we took advantage of improving capital markets and diversified our debt structure by entering into an agreement to issue $200 million of notes in a private placement to qualified investors. 100 million of the notes were a 3.75 coupon for a five-year term and another $100 million of notes were a 5% coupon for a ten year team.", "On the stock buyback front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market and during the first quarter we purchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $101 million. ", "We defined free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures plus any non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non recurring items.", "For Q1, pre-cash flow was $95 million after funding $11 million of CapEx and adding back $2 million of non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. This strong start for the year allowed us to accelerate our buyback program and put this on a path to approach $400 of free cash flow this year.", "Comparable free cash flow in Q1 last was $64 million. Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 78 days this quarter comparable to Q1 last year and inventories were up about $10 million from year end as is typical at this point in the year. ", "Overall our Q1 results were somewhat stronger than anticipated in January, many of our end markets improved as the quarter progressed and they appear to be on track to continue to do so, we presently expect our currency neutral sales to grow between 5 and 7% for the full year 2010. Currency translation based on current rates looks to be about neutral the sales growth for the full year. ", "Moving down the P&L gross margins continued to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and foreign currency translation given the relative weakness of the pound instead of the yen. Additionally product mix is favorable to margins and our new products are performing well early in the production ramp up, given these factors we now expect full- year gross margins to be up by about 75 basis points versus 2009.", "Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate almost equal to sales. We expect our operating tax rate to be about 18.5% and net interest expense is expected to be approximately $13.5 million. And our fully diluted average outstanding share count for the full year 2010 is currently estimated to be about 93.5 million shares. ", "Rolling all of this together we currently expect Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.85 to $4 per share. For Q2 we expect our currency neutral sales to grow around 7%. At current exchange rates, currency translation should increase sales by about 1% bringing our reported sales growth to 8%. At this sales level non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter are expected to be between $0.86 and $0.96. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you John. Operator I think at this point we can open up the phones for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question is from the line of Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. The introduction of the H-Class seems to be off to a pretty strong start, relative to sort of your initial expectations if you sort of had to parse out what sort of positively surprised you at customer feedback versus where you had to sort of reposition or maybe augment sort of the marketing angle. I mean what's been sort of the, you\u2019re sort of take on and sort of how that has gone so far and what customer basis are showing sort of the greatest interest in terms of the initial orders?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Ross, I think it's important, that this introduction of the H-Class was a little bit different than major platform introductions that we've had in the past. I refer to it as what is it either 0 lag notch where when we announced the product we started shipping potentially immediately. We had trained the sales force we had the marketing literature already that was introduced typically, introduced these platforms kind of licensed to get the Pittcon and then your shipping by the end of the subsequent quarter. This was you know and so part of it is just the way, our businesses evolve so we were very happy first of all with our ability to drive the developments and the manufacturing to the point where we are able to do that.", "Then I would say the most interesting dynamic I think has been with competitive accounts we knew we had some early indication in some of our classic Waters accounts about the reaction to it, we clearly aiming this technology and trying to bring a faster uptake curve into the QA regulated the applications part of our business and taking this instrument into competitive accounts has been very, very positive.", "So I think that\u2019s probably the early indication, the other thing I think is we commented on that often times you introduced a new platform like this and the immediate response you see is delay because customers are used to buying your old products and they kind of put things on hold to evaluate and sometimes they run new systems through months of evaluation studies I am sure we saw some of that, but overall the net effect was really a positive effect rather than a delayed effect. ", "Art Caputo", "Yeah I would say the thing about the H-Class was keep in mind we introduced UPLC now growing about 6 years ago and something very unique in our business is we were left alone for our intents and purposes for about 5 years before any significant competition beside try and participate but throughout that period and out there several thousands of systems being installed and evaluated, we had a luxury of working with these customers and very precisely understanding what does it take now to move this technology downstream. And for intents and purposes replaced the traditional HPLC marketplace, while at the same time taking into consideration a large installed base HPLC that have been in play for 30 years. And so we really took our time we focused on the customer needs we delivered a product that probably is, hits the mark so precisely in terms of what customers were asking for and now seeing it\u2019s hard to argue with something that you said if you do this we\u2019ll buy it and so we\u2019re experiencing this and the beauty of it is the demonstration units are in place there is no delay on delivery. It utilizes the same broad systems chemistry solution we\u2019ve had out for six years. So its really the experience that we've had with paying off for us on this strategy.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Does that cover everything Ross.", "Ross  Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "That's good. And just so I understand, so if you had a look at the industrial and the biopharma end markets, where you both had pretty strong growth, if you had to parse out market recovery versus new product momentum in terms of contributing to the strong growth, how would you weight the two, just to get a sense of how much of it is actually sort of customers coming back and how much of it is actually Waters maybe taking a bit of share with some of the new product momentum that you have?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think probably in the industrial arena particularly for Waters that\u2019s probably more market related. It would surprise me if you didn\u2019t see others servicing the industrial market to see some good results because I think it was so tough that they were bouncing off more modest comparisons. We clearly had some good uptake in response to our new products, but more in the industrial arena, I\u2019d say its probably a market dynamic. In the biopharma, boy, I think our new product are really striking a chord, not only the ones that we've already let you peak at but early it buys on some of other new stocks that come in very enthusiastic I think in the biopharma segment ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A question on guidance -- you upped your organic revenue view for the year. So maybe you could just talk through what are the things that are -- specific things that are better than when you guys first looked at the year, maybe if anything is worse, then how you got to that view for the full year.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure, I\u2019ll give the 30,000 foot view and then John can bring me back to Earth. Clearly the industrial market recovery is better than we had banked on in our budget. We thought we would be in perhaps attached on the conservative side because we didn\u2019t want to over stayed out our spending budgets coming into the year. But industrial, we see that very clearly in the TA piece of our business we also see it in the Waters piece. So, I think the strength of the recovery in the India Generic Pharmaceuticals is pretty clear that\u2019s not insignificant piece of our business, the reaction to the H-Class and the seamlessness with which its coming to market and the continued interest in the high-end mass spectrometry product lines are all encouraging. I think the thing that keep us from being maybe slightly more optimistic at this point is waiting to be sure that overall the developed markets in the United States and in Western Europe can show sustainable strength pockets there is that the industrial markets there but [big] Pharma is still going through some of the merger pains. We see a lot of encouragement from that segment of the business but we probably don\u2019t want to take it to the bank quite yet. John?", "John Ornell ", " ", "Yeah, I think the only other thing I would say is that we had a relatively strong", "Q1 with Japan, we are not expecting Japan to grow full year at those rates certainly but on the other side of that within China we had a very difficult basic comparison with the larger Melamine business that rubs off in the rest of the year. So, that\u2019s a natural offset so that Asia, in full, I think, has balance going forward relative to what you saw in the first quarter. ", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", " ", "Okay, great, thanks; and then, just another one on gross margins for the year. Is the change mostly due to currency? Or maybe just walk us through the moving parts of that as we go through the year in terms of some of the manufacturing transitions, how that's going to impact gross margin, and anything else we should be thinking about on that line.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The currency dynamics that we saw in the first quarter principally I continue however the base of comparison becomes less difficult if you will if you look at but going forward quarters of last year. So a piece of the improvement in gross margin, a significant piece is currency. But that being said, I would also say that layout of the gate, we have some very good product costs on new H-Class that are contributing even in the first quarter to improve margins. We\u2019ve had a relatively strong chemistry business subjects provided a little bit of upside on the mix as well, we expect that to continue. And our Thermal Analysis business is done very well in some of these industrial accounts and within the TA product line that tends to be the one that has the higher mix of all of these factors. We think we will continue and contribute to the sort of tick up in gross margin for the year.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then anything on the manufacturing piece is going to be especially impactful on the back half?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I would say that that\u2019s pretty much on plan. We still have the H-Class transfer in the work, so we\u2019re looking to see the, the benefits of that as we move through the second half of the year. I\u2019d say this is probably nothing different from where we started the year at January from a guidance perspective.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. And then just one last one from me. On the Americas and Europe, maybe you could just give us the growth is obviously little bit slower there, so maybe just give us a sense of the different markets there you talked about pharma, but beyond that kind of what\u2019s driving that, you talked about 2% kind of what, what are you seeing specifically out of those geographies? Thanks.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yeah I\u2019d say if we looked at the developed world Europe and the US specifically here a large pharma was really the problem, as it relates to the decline that we saw in that business was a little more that we might have anticipated, well offsetting now was some pretty interesting strength in the final business outside of large pharma. Government and academic in total was good in that part of the world then we saw the industrial business begin to come back in those regions, so I would say really the only serious pocket of concern is large pharma a lot of that I am certain is merger related I think we are going to see that dissipate as we make our way through the year. Some of those accounts were up but many warrants, I think it was a may be a little bit of a lag in the CapEx release perhaps in some of the (Inaudible) and its not impossible to think that the H-Class launch well it was very successful right out of the gate is some accounts where they are going to do a little bit more work on that before its implemented and I think that\u2019s a potential upside of some of these large pharma houses too as we go forward.

It sounds like you still have pretty good G-2 backlog and it sounds like TA orders were may be decently stronger than the actual sales number. So I was just wondering if momentum actually builds as the quarter progressed and as we turned the page into Q2? ", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I wouldn\u2019t say it was a homogenous dynamic as it rarely is I would say overall the last part of the quarter was stronger than the first part that\u2019s always kind of the case with January being a tough side to a year. But some geographies finish stronger than others. Overall, I would say our more interesting dynamics is the early indicators of request for demonstrations, request for quotes, quote activity and some of them the soft and more intangible that I think are much stronger than we anticipated would be at this stage of the game. So that\u2019s the kind of momentum that I think, it doesn\u2019t result in sales in the first quarter but we\u2019re optimistic we could gain for stronger sales as we go forward.", "We also in the first quarter, this quarter ended with the Easter season you had Good Friday, that always throws a little confusion particularly at the areas like Western Europe and the more traditional religious areas and we didn\u2019t have that last year, it\u2019s always a guess as to how much that affects your order activity lots of strong orders coming in the next week. So you know again intangible dealing that you know its all pretty good going forward.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay, that's helpful. You beat the midpoint of your guidance by $0.04. You bumped up full-year EPS guidance by I think it's $0.15 at the midpoint. You did bump up your revenue outlook, but I think just a little bit; I think you guided to mid-single digit growth, maybe, a little bit higher than that. ", "But it doesn't sound like it changed a lot and it sounds like you still expect this to be a year where you spend a little bit more operationally than the norm. So what's changed here? Is it really the revenue number? Is it gross margin, or should we be a little bit more positive when it comes to modeling out non-operational items? ", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yeah, I guess what\u2019s changed is we certainly have taking a slightly different view on gross margins we had some, good experience right out of the gain on some of the new products in addition to some of the currency benefits that we\u2019ve seen. ", "Yes, we are continuing to make investments small investments in headcount where we need to will continue to do that. So, we are not going to see a significant gap in the growth of our expenses versus the top line but that\u2019s no different than what we have said in January. ", "Currency for the full year is a little bit less of the top line benefit but offsetting that and more is the fact that we did move the organic growth from what we defined as mid single digit four to six to five to seven. ", "So, it\u2019s little bit here and there that basically say that you know the incremental profitability that we saw out of the business in the first quarter principally continues for the next three and that comes pretty close to the full year increase that, you\u2019ve seen in the guidance for the EPS.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "And last question, it sounds like you guys are spending a little bit more on SG&A than you normally would. I think that's associated with just the spending ramp as you build towards some of these new launches. Any way to quantify that just so we can think about leverage potential moving forward?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yeah, I guess, one of the things we look in the first quarter is you have to recognize that currency on SG&A was about 4%. So, the 8% growth in the SG&A was really only about 4% ex-currency. ", "Normally when we look at this business we typically say that we have sales growing in the 7, 8, 9% range on an average year you\u2019re able to grow your SG&A couple of points less than the sales line. ", "And I would say that, that model is likely to be what we\u2019ll continue to say going forward beyond this year because of as you pointed out because of investments that we need to make this year and this year being kind of a year of recovery on the spend line is not likely to be quite as much leverage, I don't think the expenses go exactly the same rate of sales, but there is not likely to be the full one or two points of differential.

The interest in the H-Class is that I cant if I need to also run an HPLC separation item. So well some people are buying it to future proof for potentially UPLC applications we think this will be the case moving forward, for the most part now people now are still focused on purchasing any of our UPLC products with the prospect of taking advantage of the superior performance capability.

I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the Medicare dynamic it hasn\u2019t currently popped up as a particular issue -- may be we\u2019re seeing it in the optimism in the generics who clearly kind of by support get our favorite position in this bill, we are certainly seeing great activity amongst our generic accounts. We haven\u2019t seen the direct results of Medicare concern is certainly reasonable to think it has to be attracted into their business plan. ", "I think, the way we interpret our results so far is become very traditional in our big pharma accounts to see slow starts to the year and this was no different. So you\u2019re still seeing an enormous amount of interest in our new products in those accounts. We are already I think as we start the second quarter seeing some order flow that we didn\u2019t see in the first quarter.

We have had major departments managers complain to us that they have to make use of their equipment much longer then they ever anticipated. And we still firmly believe that that\u2019s going to ultimately result in some pent up replacement demand coming through the system. But I would say even higher in the dynamics is emphasis on cost control and productivity and I think they have been talking about that for a long time now it really, making itself felt in the innards of pharmaceutical. And they are really looking at the productivity the H-Class and ACUITY can give them. Because it really means doing a lot of their jobs with a lot fewer people, they can replace multiple traditional HPLCs with fewer H-Class or fewer ACUITY, they\u2019ve getting dramatically change their productivity. Is that I think is really picked up in terms of the level of interest and specifically in big pharma. ", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "I think you mentioned stimulus is not a big contributed.

Can you comment specifically on how much of the interest is coming from ACUITY users versus some of the lower volume Alliance users at this point?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Okay little bit I\u2019ll give a flavor to that. If you think about ACUITY we think about this in the context of accounts. As we look at the number of ACUITYs sold over the last five years and so we\u2019ve had very broad-based penetration, it is almost impossible to find large accounts it doesn't sound multiple traditional ACUITY UPLC systems. So what you're dealing with is the ACUITYs purchase has been purchased by early adopters, development people and some method development and even QC departments. So what we\u2019re really looking at is its while we are selling H-Class to the people who have very little exposure to UPLC at all its probably less than a quarter of the sales, so both of the sales are really the early adopters testing it, verifying it, setting up an understanding with the technology coming to us and say here are the areas within our corporation that we want to utilize this technology. But here the attributes I think is different from that than for us this is the new purchase traditionally those design to us early adaptors get a very broad versatility, full capability research type view of the product, here is what's required of people in methods development, quality control, while routine applications what typical HPLCs user would look to attributes that, emulate more of our Alliance products than the full research grade. So I\u2019d say that the bulk of our focus of interest is to progress the technology downstream in the already dominant position we have across large and for that matter is intermediate by companies throughout the technology laboratory world out there.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Can you comment on how you look at the pull-through opportunity for mass spectrometers with H-Class?", "Art Caputo", "The predominant mass spectrometry sale is still oriented towards our traditional UPLC system. Primary reasons for that is the technical attributes of the product lend itself very well for the extremely high speed that mass spectrometry operates within, extremely fit, change level of volumes and well H-Class will work nicely with a mass spectrometer for many applications. Most mass spectrometers are really looking at the attributes that are full research grades, super high performance UPLC system that has great levels of versatility. But when we think that we shift overtime as you may go downstream and Mass Spectrometry gets more prolific in the more routine applications, but for the time being, we are finding that nanoACQUITY the traditional ACQUITY has the bulk of those sales clearly with the original ACQUITY systems.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Maybe one for Doug. I know you don't like to talk about product cycles ahead of time, but you did lay the bait for ASMS, and I think the quote was significant product cycles. Is there any kind of color you can give us in terms of whether this is a high-end system targeting the academic markets or something more for pharma? Or, can you just kind of point us directionally in terms of where you're going?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think the best I can do for you Tycho is the same, look broadly I mean I think you will be seeing very interested in things at that kind of augment the high end G-2 Synapt kind of thing. You would be looking at multi purpose capabilities and I think you will also see as how work closes into the midline and on the bench drop, so still a little bit early we're several weeks away from ASMS but I think its, watch this space for further notice ", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "And then last one for John can you just quantify how much the margin this quarter was currency versus cost reductions? I know you talked a little bit about how you're thinking over for the rest of the year.", "John Ornell", "Yes, on a year-over-year basis there was about 200 basis point decline associated with the currency and there was about a 60 basis point improvement associated with the cost reductions and mix that offset that.", "Operator", "Jeff Ares with Leerink Swann & Company.", "Jeff Ares - Leerink Swann & Company", "I know you gave a little bit of color on India being a little better in the generic pharma, and as well as last year I remember it was pretty weak in Q1 and through the first half of the year.

I think India at this point is about flat in the first quarter 2010 with 2008. Gives you an idea, it\u2019s not huge growth over 2008 substantial growth over 2009 but I think a very clear indication that things around the mend there in that generic industry is kind of coming back to at least equilibrium if not prepared to grow very strong.

(Operator Instructions) I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation second quarter financial results conference call. With me on today\u2019s call is John Ornell, the Waters Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, President of the Waters Division and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "As is our normal practice I\u2019m going to start with an overview of the quarter\u2019s highlights. John will follow with details on our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the third quarter and for the full year, but before we get to that, I\u2019d like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John Ornell", "During the course of this conference call we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding future income statement results of the company, this time for Q3 and full-year 2010. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.", "For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 in part one under the caption business risk factors.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2010.", "During this call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning.", "In our discussions of the results of operations we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income per Diluted Share included in this morning\u2019s press release.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you John. Well from many perspectives I think we\u2019re pleased with our second quarter\u2019s performance. Sales of our newly introduced instrument systems and a broad-based improvement in customer demand contributed to 9% currency neutral sales growth and close to 20% growth in earnings per share. At the same time, we are confident that our exciting new product launches, which we showcased at June\u2019s ASMS conference and earlier this year, will provide us with a powerful competitive edge in the second half of 2010 and further into 2011. ", "When you look at the quarter, sales growth to pharmaceutical and industrial chemical customers significantly improved in comparison to what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few quarters. As you know, the pharmaceutical segment represents more than half of the Waters Division\u2019s sales, and it was improvements in this customer set that contributed most meaningfully to the division\u2019s growth in the second quarter.", "Geographically, pharmaceutical growth was strongest in North America and Asia, with drug discovery and QC applications leading the way. Sales in the quarter for most of our large-cap drug accounts grew sequentially from the levels that we saw in the first quarter. However, in absolute terms, demand remained somewhat weak, as many of these customers continue to rationalize their operations. Fortunately, strong demand from generic, specialty biopharmaceuticals, and TRO customers much more than offset the slower sales at our larger drug firms and all in our pharmaceutical business segment enjoyed double-digit top-line growth in the quarter.", "Sales to industrial chemical accounts were also strong in the quarter, and our TA instruments division benefitted from a significant and broad rebound in capital spending. As you may recall, TA\u2019s largest customer segment is the industrial chemical market, manufacturers of fine chemicals and polymers used in applications ranging from consumer electronics, to aerospace components, to medical devices. And as you may remember, the severe economic conditions that we endured in late 2008 and through 2009 resulted in a pronounced decline in TA\u2019s sales. ", "Throughout this difficult period, TA continued to maintain its technological leadership, provided market-leading customer support, and successfully maintained system pricing. This year, as we continue to emerge from a recession, we are seeing a very impressive rebound in demand for both instrumentation and services at our TA division. ", "Within the Waters division, we are seeing a similar recovery in demand at fine chemical accounts, though this customer segment is a significantly smaller percentage of the Waters division\u2019s overall business.", "If you look at our non-profit customers, the combined government and academic sales grew more modestly in the quarter and were highlighted by robust shipment volume of high-end mass spec systems to universities. ", "U.S. stimulus-related business was not a significant factor in the quarter, and in almost all regions sales to government customers softened as new austerity measures seemed to be having somewhat of an impact.", "Looking at our overall sales geographically, Asia and North America saw impressive growth in the quarter. Within Asia the recovery of business in India from last year\u2019s weak levels was a very significant growth driver while our businesses in China and Eastern Asia also continued to grow nicely. The outlook for businesses in Asia, outside of Japan, appears healthy as we move into the second half of this year.", "In Japan, you will recall that we had a very successful first quarter sales result as government stimulus funds were spent ahead of the close of their fiscal year. We knew that last quarter sales were not indicative of long-term demand in Japan, and expected full-year currency-neutral revenue growth to be at the mid-single-digit level. In the second quarter we saw a modest decline in sales in Japan, bringing the first half constant-currency sales growth rate to a little less than 10%.", "Recently, much concern has been voiced about economic weakness in Europe. However, in the second quarter our European currency-neutral sales grew at about the same rate as the company\u2019s overall rate. Within Europe, sales growth in Eastern Europe was strong and for the region as a whole mass spectrometry shipments were robust.", "Moving forward, we share in what appears to be a prevailing concern that Western Europe may again experience a period of soft demand. However, we are not currently seeing this in our order trends and continue to believe that our overall European business will deliver at least moderate growth in the second half of 2010.", "Earlier today I mentioned that our recent new product launches positively contributed to our results in the most recently completed quarter. And now I would like to review with you the instrument systems that I was referring to and provide you with some perspective on the potential impact of these products on our future performance.", "If you\u2019ll look at the second quarter, Synapt mass spectrometry and ACUITY H-Class systems were the star performers. With our Synapt G-2 MS and Synapt G-2 HDMS instruments, we are continuing to strengthen our position in research-grade mass spectrometry. Since we began shipments in late 2009, our Synapt user base has been rapidly expanding. ", "More publications from leading researchers have described the instrument\u2019s unique performance attributes for a variety of applications and we have continued to enhance the system\u2019s performance with more ionization options, new advanced chromatography inlets, and application-tailored software packages. ", "At this year\u2019s ASMS conference in June, we introduced two new high-performance systems: the Xevo G2 QTof, and the Xevo TQ-S. These systems have been engineered to deliver industry-leading performance in compact and easy to use instrument configurations. ", "The Xevo G2 QTof incorporates our new QuanTof (inaudible) technology an innovation that facilitates high sensitivity compound identification and quantification in a single experimental step. In applications from environmental and food safety screening, to drug metabolite identification, the Xevo G2 can generate results in a single run that previously required running multiple experiments on a range of MS instruments. I\u2019m pleased to tell you that we began shipping the new Xevo G2 QTof late in the second quarter, and that we\u2019ll be ramping up production to address our order backlog in the third quarter. ", "The Xevo TQ-S is our new flagship research tandem, or as commonly referred to, triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. This new system targets the largest market opportunity in mass spectrometry-based instrumentation, and we are excited to have what we believe is the highest-performance offering. We feel that we have an opportunity to gain share in applications where high sensitivity, that is the ability to see trace amounts of organic or bio molecules, is of primary importance.", "Our ACUITY UPLC position, a leading market position in chromatography for high-performance MS applications, gives us easy access to our targeted customer set and the ability to offer complete UPLC MS systems for those customers requiring a turnkey high-performance solution. Order volume for the new Xevo TQ-S ramped nicely in the second quarter, and we plan to begin customer shipments this quarter.", "Earlier this year I had the opportunity to speak to you about our ACUITY strategy and our new ACUITY H-Class UPLC system. As you may recall, the H-Class instrument offers capabilities that allow for the running of legacy HPLC methodologies while providing an easy upgrade path to UPLC performance. It is, however, a true UPLC system with attributes that leverage the performance of our ACUITY column chemistries. ", "The ACUITY H-Class was developed based on feedback that we received from our largest ACUITY users, primarily customers that have already deployed UPLC instruments through their development organization. They told us that they are now more confident of transferring UPLC technology throughout their quality control laboratories for required instrument design features to facilitate that process. These design features and additional performance enhancements were incorporated into our ACUITY H-Class. ", "While we introduced and began shipments of the H-Class in the first quarter of 2010, early feedback that we received from the market was very positive, and that excitement level only grew throughout the second quarter. More important, in the second quarter, its first full quarter in the market, the H-Class has made significant inroads in opening the pharmaceutical QC market to UPLC technology, and we are confident that this trend will continue in the second half of 2010 and beyond.", "All of this is a very encouraging dynamic. Not only are we pleased to see the rapid adoption of our new LC systems, we are also pleased to see signs that our new ACUITY H-Class UPLC may be a key factor in initiating a long-awaited new instrument replacement cycle in pharmaceutical QC.", "From my recent comments you can likely sense that I\u2019m very excited about the strength of our new product offerings. However, our success is also dependent on funds being available globally to acquire new goods and services, and it is today\u2019s macroeconomic concerns that somewhat temper my near term enthusiasm. ", "John will review with you our financial outlook for the remainder of this year, but before passing you on to him, I want to say that we feel that we are emerging from the first half of this year with strong business momentum and reasonable visibility for the third quarter. Capital budgets for some of our largest accounts are still being released, and we enjoy order backlogs for our newly introduced products. ", "That said, we feel it is most prudent to be cautious in our full-year outlook and to adopt a reasonable but conservative spending budget for our business. Major product development projects will be fully funded and strategic initiatives such as our program to transfer instrument production to tax-have sites will proceed as planned. However, we continue to monitor customer demand and our internal spending in an effort to react appropriately to dynamic business conditions.", "In the second quarter, our pre-tax cash generation exceeded $100 million, and for the half-year period was more than $200 million. We feel that cash generation is an important internal and external measurement in evaluating the company\u2019s performance, and this year we believe we are well-positioned to generate about $0.25 of free cash for each dollar of sales we make.", "So in closing, I will reiterate that I am pleased with our performance for the first half of 2010. We remain cautiously optimistic that we can continue to grow our top and bottom lines through the remainder of 2010 and into 2011 at rates more in line with our pre-recessionary growth trends and we remain committed to a focused business strategy that has served us well for many years.", "So I\u2019d like to now turn it over to John for the financials.", "John Ornell", "Thank you Doug, and good morning. Second quarter sales increased by 8% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 19% at $0.93 this quarter, compared to earnings of $0.78 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.90 this quarter, compared to $0.72 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Reviewing Q2 sales results compared to Q2 last year, sales were up 9% this quarter before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 1% this quarter. Looking at our sales growth geographically, and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 11%, Europe\u2019s sales were up 9%, sales within Japan were down 3%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14%.", "Turning to the product front, within the Waters division instrument systems sales increased by 8% and recurring revenues grew by 7% this quarter before foreign exchange effects. Within our TA instruments division, sales were strong and increased by 28% versus prior year as customers returned to more traditional levels of purchasing activity.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q2 non-GAAP reported financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance continued to be strong this quarter and came in about as expected at 60.3%, comparable to prior year end last quarter. ", "SG&A expenses increased 2% this quarter compared to prior year. Salaries increased modestly and marketing costs were up related to food safety programs, but these increases were largely mitigated by lower currency translation costs, lower than anticipated incentive plan expenses from finalization of 2009 accrual balances, and a continued restraint on adding additional headcount at this time. For the remainder of the year we expect SG&A to grow at a mid-single-digit rate. ", "R&D expenses increased by 6% this quarter from continued new product development programs, partially offset by favorable currency translations related to our mass-spec operations in the U.K. We expect R&D to grow at a similar rate during the second half of the year.", "Our effective income tax rate came in a little better than projected at about 18%. A modest shift in estimated production levels in favor of our tax-advantaged geographies reduced our anticipated full-year 2010 tax rate by about a half a point. This provided about a penny of benefit to our Q2 EPS.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $754 million and debt totaled $757 million, bringing us to a net debt position of about $3 million. ", "On the stock buyback front, we continued to purchase our shares on the open market, and during the second quarter we purchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for $75 million.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, less any non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual and nonrecurring items. For Q2 free cash flow remains strong. It came it at $102 million after funding $11 million of cap backs and adding back about $1 million of non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. ", "This strong start to the year allowed us to accelerate our buyback program and keeps us on a firm path towards $400 million of free cash flow this year. Comparable free cash flow in Q2 last year was $63 million, which included funding $18 million for a new TA facility. ", "Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 73 days this quarter, down one day versus Q2 last year, and inventories were up $13 million from year end, as is typical at this point in the year. Overall, our Q2 results were somewhat stronger than we had anticipated at the start of the quarter. Our new products have been well-received and continue to gain traction and customer demand continues to recover from depressed levels we saw last year. I", "In April, we said that we expected our currency neutral sales to grow between 5% and 7% for the full year 2010. Through the first half we grew 8%, slightly over our expectations, primarily due to a strong rebound in our TA instrument business. For the second half, we now project our sales growth to average about 7%, with Q3 growing a little faster than this and Q4 a little slower, given differing bases of comparison (easier in Q3, tougher in Q4). ", "New product introductions at ASMS, a strong ramp of sales of our new H-Class products, and a building backlog of orders altogether give us confidence that the organic growth of the business is on more stable footing as we enter the second half of the year.", "On the other hand, general economic uncertainties remain and cause us to be a bit cautious as we consider growth expectations in the fourth quarter. For the full year then, we expect organic sales growth between 7% and 8%. Currency translation at today\u2019s levels is expected to reduce sales growth by about 1%. ", "Moving down to P&L, gross margins continue to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and by foreign currency translation in the second half given the continuation of relative weakness of the British Pound and strength of the Japanese Yen. Additionally, product mix is favorable to margins and our new products are performing well early in their production ramp up. ", "Given these factors, we expect full year gross margins to be up about 50 basis points versus 2009. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate. Net interest expense is expected to be about $13.5 million, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect our operating tax rate to be approximately 18%. Our fully diluted average outstanding share count for the full year 2010 is currently estimated to be around 93.5 million shares.", "Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.92 to $4.02 per share. For Q3 we expect our currency neutral sales to grow around 8%. At current exchange rates currency translation should decrease sales growth by about 2%, bringing reported sales growth to 6%. At this sales level, non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share for the third quarter are expected to be between $0.93 and $0.97.", "Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you John, and operator I think at this point we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions.)", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Congratulations on a nice quarter. Could you remind us again, in previous cycles, when after a downturn and then a pickup in the industrial, you had a really strong TA quarter, how long does kind of a rebound like this usually occur Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Frankly Quintin, we haven\u2019t seen anything that was quite as sharp a dropoff as we saw late 2008 into 2009. So I\u2019m not sure that what we\u2019ve seen in the last 10 years is indicative of what we\u2019re likely to experience this time. We think that the second half is going to continue to be very robust in the TA business, and it probably has legs just from that bounce back in 2011. There\u2019s no signs of this tailing off at this point. The start to this quarter has been continuing very robust at TA and they\u2019re optimistic for the rest of this year. Realistically, I think it peters out as we get into the, further on in 2011, but I see no sign that we\u2019re going in for another dip. So I\u2019d say we look good into 2011.", "John Ornell", "And I\u2019d say the Q3 comparison, Quintin, is pretty comparable to Q2, and then Q4\u2019s basis a bit stronger, so I\u2019d say the Q2 results, while we\u2019re not in our guidance suggesting that it continues at that very high rate, the expectation would still be for some type of double-digit growth, perhaps in the third quarter before it begins to mitigate as we exit the year.", "Quintin Lai", "", "Thank you. And then, with respect to H-Class, have you seen an impact on your Alliance sales and the people that are taking it up, are they Waters legacy customers or are you seeing market share wins to new customers?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019d say the H-Class hasn\u2019t had much impact on Alliance. We have seen, if anything, an impact on higher-end ACUITY sales. So if you look at the mix I\u2019d say some of those H-Class sales would have previously been ACUITY sales, not so much Alliance. But our strongest Alliance customers today are still in India, and in those generic accounts. What\u2019s really encouraging about the H-Class is that it\u2019s beginning to penetrate into classical QC applications, and that works on several fronts. Number one, that\u2019s an area where we\u2019re seeing large pharma long out their replacement cycles and number two, they tend to the highest purchases of columns. Those applications are heavy column users. Now, the benefit of H-Class is they can use traditional columns, but as they move to more high-throughput applications and get truly into UPLC applications, they use more UPLC columns. So I think that works in our favor on a number of fronts. We think we\u2019re at the front end of that but the early signs are very encouraging.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Doug, in the earlier comments you talked about investing during the downturn and in particular with regard to the TA business can you comment on whether the results you\u2019re seeing here are market growth are you really starting to pull some share here? And can you also comment on competitive wins in mass spec overall and are you starting to pull some share in that business as well?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "You know we need to be very careful about talking about share changes on the basis of one or two quarters, Tycho, so I firmly believe that our most recent mass spec offerings are at the top of the class. And our customers tell us that they\u2019re very happy with the G2 kind of performance in our QTof grade instruments and it\u2019s early on in the triple quad business but boy we see side by side evaluations of our new triple and we haven\u2019t seen any side by sides where we have lost. And that business is growing at very good, solid, double digit rates and nobody reports quite as much detail on that business as we do, but we can\u2019t find too many competitors reporting that kind of growth in their mass spec business, particularly the high end mass spec business. So all of those are good signs that probably in the short term we\u2019re leading the pack here and if it continues over multiple quarters it would be hard not to suppose that we\u2019re gaining share there.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then in your comments you also talked about government sales softening and I think you made the comment austerity measures having an impact and then later you talked about you\u2019re holding up, so is it fair to assume that the government pressure was here in the U.S. and can you elaborate a little bit more on, is that just a lack of stimulus or are you seeing things actually . . .", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I apologize if that was the implication. I think the government business softness we\u2019re seeing generally. If you look at our non-profit business it was the university market that was stronger and government business, Japan in particular, we saw very strong end of their fiscal year growth in the first quarter and did not see a repeat of that in the first fiscal year of Japan. I think Japan was actually the most notable weakness in the government business but we also see signs of it in Europe and in the U.S.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then just lastly on the manufacturing over to Singapore can you comment on where you are with H-Class and transitioning that over, and then I think you\u2019ve also made the decision not to move ACUITY production over there. Can you talk about the rationale behind that?", "John Ornell", "I\u2019d say at this point Tycho, we\u2019re pretty much on track with the original plans at the start of the year and the H-Class product will make its way over there in the second half. In the interim we\u2019ve moved various UPLC detectors that have begun to ramp up production volumes there and ultimately as we transition from our existing high-end ACUITY to its next iteration, it\u2019s likely that that production in following years will make its way over to Singapore. So I would say we\u2019re on track. We\u2019re feeling really good about the all business that\u2019s being generated out of that geography and everything remains pretty positive as we look to the tail end of this year and 2011.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "", "Thank you, and congrats on a great quarter. Can we get a little more on the pharma commentary? As you think about some of the non-big-Pharma accounts, whether it\u2019s the CROs, some of the specialty guys, the Generex, can you compare and contrast what you\u2019re seeing in those various players and also is it geography based? The comments on India were pretty encouraging and so I think maybe that has part of it to do with it and then I have sort of a follow up.", "", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019d say a couple of things that are relatively positive and a couple of things that still flash some warning signs. The big drug accounts still are struggling with their acquisitions and their restructuring. So if you look at absolute comparisons of our largest pharmaceutical companies around the world, those results were negative quarter-on-quarter. That is, compared to the \u201909 quarter. What\u2019s interesting is that sequentially they improve from the first quarter to the second quarter, we\u2019re seeing order rates improve. We\u2019re also seeing a great deal of interest and quote rate activity is pretty strong there. I think you know, holding my breath and crossing my fingers, that sequentially we\u2019ll continue to see improvement in those accounts. It\u2019s hard to imagine that they could get worse. And particularly in the bio applications of those accounts we\u2019re seeing a huge amount of interest from our most recent offerings with our bio ACUITY and the results coming out of our new systems offerings. ", "So that\u2019s all encouraging. In terms of current business, generic accounts, that being particularly true in India, bouncing off poor results last year, but generic accounts in Europe and in the United States are all very strong, and that\u2019s across the board and that\u2019s where some of the interest that we\u2019re seeing in H-Clas and QC applications coming from. I think that\u2019s pretty broad based. And that\u2019s also true of CRO activity, pretty broad based geographically. So that\u2019s I think the result of our good performance in pharma. Again across the board we had double digit growth in pharma in the Waters division this quarter, so we\u2019re pretty enthusiastic about that.", "Ross Muken", "And can you talk a bit about the type of purchasing patterns we\u2019re seeing for the H-Class. You talked about the potential to spur a more significant replacement cycle. Are we seeing broad adoption across the bio-pharma base in terms of small and large type companies looking to add or replace the instrument? And with the larger ones are we seeing several box orders, are we seeing large scale box orders, or is it very sort of customer specific.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "It really is customer specific. We\u2019ve begun to see multiple unit orders in pharma accounts in QC, but I caution it\u2019s that the front end of that cycle and I need to see more evidence before I really take it to the bank. I\u2019d say it\u2019s an encouraging early sign. It\u2019s across the board. We\u2019re seeing that kind of activity show itself in big pharma, in specialty pharma, and in biotech. I\u2019d say the bio applications are probably the most near-term, where the traditional small molecule pharma is longer term, but of course all of these accounts are saying they\u2019re gearing up for the bio applications, so I think we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of things there. And those are the most near-term areas where they have the most money to spend I\u2019d say Ross.", "Ahmet Bala - Citigroup", "I just wanted to continue to follow up on that H-Class QA/QC question. Is there any way you can tease out in the second quarter what percentage of your H-Class is actually going to the QA/QC setting? Is it 5%, 10%? Any numbers you could put there? And can you also talk about the backlog? Did it actually grow quarter over quarter?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Yes, our backlog did grow in the quarter, so that\u2019s certainly an encouraging sign. In terms of the H-Class in QC, I don\u2019t know whether we could actually give you a specific number there. Art, do you have anything qualitative to say about H-Class in the QC market?", "Art Caputo", "Generally speaking, we don\u2019t go into that level of detail, but suffice it to say that the product was really targeted at the downstream development, method development, and quality control segments, so it\u2019s safe to say that easily half our sales are going into those two areas for that product. It\u2019s also being well-accepted in food testing and environmental testing, so it\u2019s broad based. But the product was designed to be, whereas the original ACUITY was leaning on the front end for the bulk of the sales the H-Class was designed for the pre-quality control development of methodologies and then carrying it down into the execution and being a system that can either conduct a legacy method of quality control or either go through the conversion to HPLC, or be a system down the road if they ever decided they did want to improve the productivity. There are separations that UPLC do that within H-Class. In rough numbers it\u2019s the bulk of the sales and it\u2019s roughly half the market for that business, for those two segments.", "Ahmet Bala", "", "And can I just ask you just one quick follow up on the gross margin? You\u2019re talking about 50% year over year, or 50 basis points year over year growth of the gross margin. Can you just tease out the pieces for a second? There\u2019s FX pressure but there\u2019s mixed manufacture lift, so you can just tease out the three pieces that are leading to the gross margin expansion for the year?", "John Ornell", "I\u2019d say that if you look at the gross margin performance it was relatively strong in the first half of last year. The gross margin in the third quarter came down a bit and we\u2019re suggesting that we\u2019re more likely to be somewhat consistent with gross margins as we move into the third quarter from the second this year as a result of product mix. And also the currency environment remains very favorable for us. We have a relatively strong Yen still as we speak, so our sales in that region are being translated favorably where there\u2019s no production in that part of the world so there\u2019s no offset to the cost of sales line. And the British Pound continues to be relatively weak, so our units coming out of our Manchester operation as they\u2019re sold around the world are favorable. So that environment continues as we look at the second half, so I would say that you\u2019re looking at probably two thirds of the overall improvement is currency and the remainder is associated with cost reductions and product mix and some of the newer products that our coming out pretty strong in margins. So that\u2019s, based on where we are today, that\u2019s how it works.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So, first one, I know you had some comment about some sort of conservatism built in to the back half outlook, so could you talk about where you feel like you\u2019re being conservative. Where could the upside, and I guess by the same token where could the downside come from?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Conservative. In our second half organic growth is just a smidge slower than we\u2019re experiencing now, and if we continue to see current run rates and things involved on the new product front, it\u2019s not impossible that we could see better results. But tempering our expectations is major questions about Western Europe, particularly the government-supported segments of the Western Europe business. Frankly, all in Europe has been pretty good, but we\u2019ve seen pockets of weakness in Western Europe and that government-supported piece is under a fair amount of strain. So that tempers our expectations. We certainly saw strong government spending in Japan in the first quarter, weaker in the second quarter, so that causes us some element of concern. We factored that into our results. If things evolve a little bit better then we could possibly do a little bit better. We frankly have not seen a lot of results from stimulus spending in the United States from government stimulus spending. That could be a little bit better, but frankly we\u2019re not banking too much of that in the second half either. I\u2019d say that\u2019s where most of our conservative comes in. We might be a little conservative on how long we think the TA bounce and how high it can get so that\u2019s another element that if we turned out a little bit better we wouldn\u2019t be totally surprised. Those are the key elements of when I say we\u2019re a little bit cautious in the second half. Those are areas that we think we\u2019ve injected some degree of conservatism.", "Marshall Urist", "", "Okay perfect. And then just one other one from me. I\u2019m just curious, on China, the kind of underlying dynamic there. Are things still strong, sort of business as usual, no major changes, or are you seeing any impact on the dynamics in that market?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019d say it remains strong. We\u2019ve continued to have good, strong double-digit growth in China. Some indications that it could even see elements of strengthening. So I think China and Asia, outside of Japan, in general are still showing very good opportunities. And across technologies.", "Paul Knight \u2013 CLSA", "Do you have any difficult comps still in the China market that you\u2019re still going through, like melamine?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "No, I\u2019d say you shouldn\u2019t expect us to say, for this year, maybe next year . . .", "John Ornell", "I think with China specifically that\u2019s true. Business in general, though, we have obviously a better comp in Q3 versus Q4 but not relating to anything to do with China really specifically.", "Paul Knight", "In Asia, are you order patterns different than the rest of the world? Are they large units orders or is it the same worldwide.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019d say typically it\u2019s the same worldwide. In China sometimes we\u2019ll get a concentrated order that\u2019s a little bit larger and certainly with some of the potential business that we\u2019re seeing in the second half that could be true, but typically it hasn\u2019t been the case. I\u2019d say in general, seeing the strength that we\u2019re seeing in high-end mass spectrometry, our average order has tended upwards, but that\u2019s more of a product mix issue, Paul, than it is a general statement of how tenders are being done.", "John Ornell", "Sometimes in China you get a somewhat larger governmental order and that might make its way to different places, but that\u2019s a one-off here or there. It\u2019s not the common way of doing business, at least historically.", "Paul Knight", "Are you seeing any impact from the Indian and Korean stimulus packages on research?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I\u2019d say we\u2019re seeing a little bit in Korea probably, but our India business is traditionally highly focused on that generic drug business. So it\u2019s not a key ingredient of what we\u2019re seeing in India.", "Operator", "And before we go to our next question we do ask that you limit your turn to just one question.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "I guess just one clarification question and then a question that I was asking at the same time but can you maybe, I think you talked about having a pretty good Synapt backlog through the first half of this year, and then depending on what happened with government that maybe that wasn\u2019t as clear, and from what I\u2019m hearing you\u2019re saying government really, some of that money hasn\u2019t really materialized. So could you maybe just talk about where you\u2019re at with Synapt, and then just, that was kind of a clarification, and then if you could just talk about your free cash flow strength and whether or not there\u2019s any, given your balance sheet, whether there\u2019s any desire or appetite to be a little bit more aggressive on the buyback front.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Second question first, Jon. Our cash flow is strong. I would say there\u2019s nothing unusual in that, it\u2019s not like we dramatically raised our payables balance or anything. We think it\u2019s sustainable and we continue to evaluate the aggressiveness of our buybacks. We continue to believe that our stock is a very good investment. So I think you could think of us continuing to be on the aggressive side of that equation rather than the less aggressive side. We\u2019ll continue to lean in that direction.", "In terms of our Synapt business and really talking about our high end mass spec business, we\u2019re very confident of our position. We had a great first half in that. That\u2019s particularly so on the orders front, but also true on the shipment front. It is true that we built some backlog, and what we\u2019re talking about in terms of concerns or potential issues in the second half is not related to the high end MS. If anything, I\u2019d be surprised if we saw a material softening of high end mass spec in the second half. We\u2019re continuing to see the university piece, which of course is an indirect level of government spending in most of our areas, be very strong as it looks to that high end mass spec product line. And we have a great list of opportunities coming out of the second half. So that\u2019s a very encouraging piece of our business.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies", "John, can you just comment on the buyback plan in the context of the current M&A environment. It\u2019s slowed down a bit in the second quarter but still heavily weighted obviously in the first half, but just are you seeing anything different on the M&A side, or any emergence of opportunities that might be responsible just for tempering the buyback pace a bit?", "John Ornell", "I guess I would say that we thought we would front-end-load the program, we have front-end-loaded the program. We were relatively aggressive in the second quarter I\u2019d say, at $75 million. We talked about the program at least early in the year being targeted at maybe $250 million for the full year, so we\u2019re well ahead of that clip certainly as we make our way through the first half. We\u2019ve principally spent what we\u2019ve generated, if you will, on the program, say, for $25 million. So I\u2019d say the message there is that we are bullish on being aggressive in buyers of the stock. We\u2019ve done that. ", "There really isn\u2019t anything on the front burner right now from an M&A perspective. We continue to look at the small bolt-on acquisitions that we\u2019re typically trying to close, but I would say at least in the near term there doesn\u2019t appear to be one that would consume cash, so it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll continue to get back in the market when the window opens and continue to buy our shares in the second half. It\u2019s not impossible that we\u2019ll go well beyond, perhaps, that $250 million limit to the extent that we don\u2019t buy something on the M&A front.", "Jon Wood", "Okay, great. And then can you just give us some sense of the contribution from the suite of new products in the second quarter, whether qualitatively or quantitatively. And then within that, I know Doug mentioned strong double digits in high end mass spec. Can you give us a bit more quantitation around how the high end mass spec business did in the second quarter?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I think in terms of mass spec our overall mass spec business was well into the double digits and our high end mass spec was beyond that. It was the strongest performer across the line. So that\u2019s probably as much detail as I want to go into. It was a very strong quarter in high end mass spec. ", "In terms of the new product contribution, in the mass spec area most of that performance were products that were introduced prior to this year\u2019s AFMS. So we didn\u2019t ship any of the products that were introduced at this year\u2019s AMSM. Well, maybe a few, but nothing of any significance. So that\u2019s still one of the (inaudible) and that\u2019s probably another area where we\u2019re being perhaps a little conservative as we look to the second half.", "John Ornell", "And while the H-Class did very well, as a percent of our LC business, it\u2019s still rather modest. The trajectory is very good, but that would have had less of an impact, perhaps, on LC and will have more as we make our way through the second half.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yeah, but still very, I mean the uptake in the H-Class is very strong. That\u2019s all. I don\u2019t want to break out unit data but boy, from a standing start in the first quarter, to where we are now, it\u2019s been as strong an introduction of a new product since probably is . . . ACUITY was very strong five years ago when we introduced it but H-Class is very comparable.", "John Ornell", "All right, great, appreciate the color. So it\u2019s safe to say that in the first half of this year, very limited contribution, in terms of incremental contribution from new products, and that should definitely build into the second half.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Those words are yours, John. I think yeah, particularly on the mass spec side, those new products should contribute in the second half.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "One question in five parts. No, just kidding. So when you look at your R&D and SG&A spending, you\u2019re still being a bit conservative as you look forward to the outlook. What type of costs do you need to add back into 2011 as you start looking forward there? Are there things, and I guess at what volumes do you really think you need to, organic (inaudible) growth volumes, do you think you need to start adding people and infrastructure for next year? And off on the SG&A question, historically going between Q2 and Q3 you tend to be a little bit lower in the Q3 number in SG&A. Same trend this year?", "John Ornell", "To answer that second one first, I would say expect a mid-single-digit growth from a year-over-year perspective, Q3 to Q3 in SG&A. So if that\u2019s down a little bit, then it is, but I\u2019d say they\u2019re relatively flat Q2 to Q3. But a mid-single-digit growth in SG&A for Q3 specifically year-over-year is what we\u2019re forecasting.", "As it relates to longer term needs for investment and the like, I believe currently that to the extent that the business continues to pick up and to the extent that the economy continues to do better, that we\u2019ll have the ability to live within the organic top line growth rate in being able to fund investments in SG&A and R&D that don\u2019t force those expenses to grow at the same rate as sales. ", "Now, whether they can grow a point, two points less than sales or more is obviously dependent on how high that top line is. But I don\u2019t foresee that we\u2019re going to be needing to grow SG&A and R&D faster certainly than sales based on what we currently see in the pipeline. ", "That does afford us to put some personnel in place, principally service-type people that come into the cost of sales line but other support people as well, and we\u2019ve been doing some of that, even as we\u2019ve made our way through the first half of the year, principally international folks. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re not in a dire need there. Yes, we\u2019ll make investments in headcount if the business grows and I\u2019m confident it will be contained within what you expect from us in being able to leverage our base of costs.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowan & Company", "Couple questions, real quick ones. You guys talked about concerns about austerity measures I think specifically in Europe. Could you just size up how you\u2019re thinking about your exposure as a percentage of sales to anything that would change in terms of European government spending specifically? And then my second question is, I believe you reduced your full year gross margin growth guidance by 25 basis points. If I\u2019m wrong, forget the question. If I\u2019m right, can you just break out how much of this change is attributable to FX versus, you know, I guess a couple of variables like production improvements, geographic mix, or product mix?", "John Ornell", "Within Europe the government piece of the business there is under 10%, it\u2019s probably even closer to 6% or 7%, perhaps. I don\u2019t have that right in front of me, but it\u2019s under 10. And to the extent that it slows down a bit it\u2019s not, we\u2019re not saying it\u2019s going to go to zero, but it\u2019s likely to have an impact. It might be a few percent of growth opportunity. The other, as it relates to the gross margins, full-year expectation. You\u2019re right, it is 25 basis points and that\u2019s all currency. That\u2019s just slight movement that we\u2019ve seen in currency from where we last gave guidance. The rest of the margin expectations from an organic perspective are comparable to what we said in April.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay, and John, just to clarify, just to make sure people don\u2019t get confused, that\u2019s 7% of Europe. That\u2019s 7% of Europe, not total sales. I mean, that\u2019s clear, but I just want to make sure everybody understand that I understand it correctly.", "John Ornell", "That\u2019s correct.", "Doug Schenkel", "So a much smaller percentage as a percentage of the total.", "John Sullivan \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Can you just speak for a second, as you talk about investing in your business on an ongoing basis, what kind of investment goes on in these emerging countries like China and India? How are you improving your capability and infrastructure in that part of the world?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yeah John, every budget cycle, you know you have competing plans we have positionally been investing in terms of headcount and with us it\u2019s in areas of growth, like India and China, it\u2019s sales and service and application support people. And that continues to be where we put our incremental headcount. In those higher-growth areas of the business it\u2019s been true for a number of years now, where we kind of hold the line in the more industrial lower-growth areas of our world and add headcount in China or in Latin America, etc. It\u2019s no different and it will continue.", "Steve Willoughby \u2013 Cleveland Research", "Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the consumable and service side of the business and the trends that you\u2019re seeing there. It sounds like you\u2019re seeing an uptick or you\u2019re starting to see an uptick in maybe some pharma spending. What are you seeing on the activity side, if you could give us some color?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The service and consumables piece of our business grew nicely in the quarter, particularly true in our traditional column business, and particularly true with the UPLC column consumables that tend to be very closely tied to our instruments, unlike the more open platforms of traditiona. HPLC. So we\u2019ve seen a return to very predictable growth in that high-profit consumables piece of our business.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions.)", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Operator we could probably take one more question and then bring it to a close.", "Operator", "", "Actually I\u2019m showing no other questions at this time.", "", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well very good.

Fourth Quarter 2010 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Doug Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corp. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corp. Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "And as is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the business highlights, and John will follow with details on our financial results and then provide you with our outlook for the first quarter and for the full year 2011. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for Q1 and full year 2011. We caution you that all such statements are only", "Predictions, and that the actual events or results may differ materially.", "For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, in part one under the caption Business Risk Factors. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2011.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results which excludes the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share included in this morning's press release.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well, for Waters, 2010 was a year where we saw a broad recovery from nearly all of our end markets and strong customer acceptance of key new instrument systems. Following a challenging business environment in 2009, we started the year confident in some improvement but remain somewhat cautious in our outlook as much uncertainty certainly remain regarding the strength of the recovery. However, early in the year, we did embark on significant new product initiatives designed to strengthen our market position and to establish a foundation for a multi-year total refresh of our product portfolio. This aggressive plan started with the introduction of our ACQUITY H-Class UPLC system last January and was soon followed by a significant mass spectrometry-based systems launched midyear at the ASMS conference. ", "I'm happy to tell you that business results in 2010 exceeded our expectations and that our new product strategies meaningfully contributed to our success as we returned to double-digit top line growth for the year, along with close to 20% growth in adjusted earnings per share.", "Potentially, even more significant as we begin 2011, we have seen a continuation of improved demand and are gaining greater traction from our new system introductions.", "Looking at the fourth quarter of 2010, our sales and earnings came in ahead of our expectations, with sales increasing by 13% over the 2009 quarter and adjusted earnings per share up by 23%. ", "Geographically, all major regions performed favorably and there was balanced strength across our major product technologies. ", "We move down to P&L. Our profitability remained strong due to the success of our product introduction, our strong recurring revenue growth and our continued focus on operational efficiency.", "On the product side, new technology platforms delivered the strongest sales growth highlighted by record shipment volumes of the ACQUITY UPLC and Xevo mass spectrometers. I'm happy to tell you that our Xevo TQ-S, a tandem quadruple technology instrument that we introduced this past June had an impressive quarterly sales performance. And that increasing customer interest in this ultrasensitive performance leaving systems has a positive influence on my outlook for overall instrumentation growth in 2011.", "On the Chromatography side, ACQUITY UPLC sales drove growth in the quarter due primarily to rapid adoption of our H-Class system and regulated testing applications such as pharmaceutical quality control.", "Looking at Customer segments in the fourth quarter. We saw a mid single-digit growth in university and government spending as stronger growth in the Americas and Europe was partially offset by weakness in Japan.", "Growth in the pharmaceutical and industrial sectors was robust in the quarter and it was driven by factors that should sustain growth in the upcoming quarters.", "In our pharmaceutical end markets. We continue to see customers upgrading their labs to UPLC, as well as new business associated with biological pharmaceutical research and development. Sales at our largest pharmaceutical accounts grew modestly in the quarter while specialty generic CRO and biotechnology firms all grew at a double-digit pace.", "For our industrial end markets and looking specifically at the Waters division, we generally enjoyed nice double-digit sales growth. And while the industrial chemical industry continued to recover from the depressed spending levels in 2009, a trend that we've seen throughout 2010, it was our applied markets where we saw the greatest strength, especially in the area of food safety testing.", "On the topic of food safety, many of you have read about new regulations for food testing that are to be implemented in the U.S. We are optimistic that these new regulations will present us with an opportunity for new sales in the coming years, and we've been working, along with the U.S. FDA, to assist in the future implementation of new testing protocols. The sales growth in food safety that we saw in the fourth quarter was primarily related to a strong demand in Asia. In the U.S., we have begun to see significant interest from food manufacturers related to future regulations, and expect the food applications will go from a relatively small base be a growth driver in the U.S. in 2011 and beyond.", "I'd now like to focus on new product initiatives that will impact our business in 2011.  As I mentioned earlier this morning, UPLC and advanced mass spectrometry systems have helped drive instrument systems growth for Waters in 2010. The introduction of the ACQUITY H-Class UPLC early in 2010 was potentially the most significant product launch in Waters' recent history. Had catalyzed the broad adoption of a new product technology into a large and receptive market segment. I'm referring to labs performing regulated testing in employing HPLC technology. While we are very pleased by the rapid uptick of H-Class in 2010, we are further encouraged in the belief that this trend where in UPLC is displacing HPLC technology is now firmly established and will offer a multiyear market growth opportunity.", "With the H-Class poised to help drive the replacement of HPLC instrumentation, we continue to see opportunities to further leverage UPLC technology into new and significant applications. To that end, this month, we introduced a new instrument system for the characterization of biologics. This system combines an ACQUITY front end engineered with biocompatible service materials and proprietary UPLC columns with a new Xevo G2 top mass spectrometer. This new mass spectrometer has unique capabilities designed to optimize comprehensive characterization of biologic pharmaceutical formulation.", "In addition, this new system includes a new operating system that more seamlessly integrates the software requirements of chromatography and mass spectrometry for labs running validated methods. We plan to begin shipment of this system early this year, and we're excited about its potential to define a workhorse solution for the development and testing of biological pharmaceuticals.", "The combination of our chemistry and service products, businesses that I often referred to as recurring revenues, grew organically at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter. These businesses represent a sustainable differentiating advantage for Waters, especially against competitors that lack the capability to offer the complete solution and the promise of total support to a customer base that increasingly desires that level of assurance. Along with being appointed sustainable differentiation, our Chemistry and Service businesses have the potential to offer higher growth moving forward than in years past as more and more customers convert HPLC methods to UPLC and Waters' proprietary columns and as customers become more reliant on Waters to support new and more technologically advanced system offerings.", "So as we move into 2011, please know that we continue to have a rich new product pipeline and plans for additional and significant new chemistry, service and instrument system launches throughout the year.", "I'd now like to say a few words about our TA Instruments division. TA finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, growing sales at a double-digit pace. The fourth quarter pretty much represented a continuation of the performance that the division enjoyed throughout 2010. While a portion of TA's success can be attributed to the recovery in spending for industrial end markets, a closer analysis of the business indicates that TA's growth in 2010 was driven by additional and more sustainable factors, including the geographical expansion of its user base and rapid uptake of its technologically advanced new products such as TA's Life Science focus, biocalorimetry systems. In the fourth quarter of 2010, TA introduced a new research differential scanning calorimetry system, or DSC. This new instrument, the Discovery DSC, represents the first embodiment of a new instrument platform that will migrate across the TA product line. We plan shipment of the Discovery DSC system early this year and expect orders and sales to ramp nicely in 2011 based on the very positive customer reception this system has received.", "Now before turning you over to John for a more detailed review of our financials, I'd like to speak a little about our capital deployment and some thoughts about the future. In 2010, we generated over $400 million in free cash flow, and this represents about $0.25 on each sales dollar. During the year, our principal use of cash was our share repurchase program. Throughout the year, we executed the program on a fairly steady course and feel that the resulting reduction in share count delivered significant value to our shareholders. Though we actively looked, we consummated no significant business acquisitions in 2010 and plan to continue our conservative and focused M&A strategy for 2011.", "In light of this focus on the long-term organic growth of our business, last week, we announced plans to build a new mass spectrometry facility near Manchester, England. This facility will both expand and consolidate our current footprint in the U.K. And when the new facility is completed in 2013, it will house our R&D, manufacturing and customer support functions that are currently spread across multiple buildings in Manchester. In addition, the new facility will offer state-of-the-art customer demonstration laboratories and training facilities. This investment in the U.K. is indicative of our long-term commitment to attract and retain the best technical talent and ensure technological leadership in mass spectrometry and associated technologies.", "In closing, I would like to reiterate some thoughts that I cited earlier. Looking back at 2010, we are all pleased that the economic conditions that surfaced in late 2008 and were existent throughout 2009 appear to be behind us. However, from the strength of our current product portfolio and in light of the profitable recovery of our business in 2010, it should be obvious that we never stopped investing in the future success of Waters and remained confident in our focused business strategy.", "At this time, I am optimistic that we can continue the positive momentum that we established in 2010. Early ordering patterns in 2011 and customers\u2019 positive perceptions to our new system offerings are very encouraging. In addition, we feel confident in our ability to grow our market share in the more developed markets while we benefit from rapid adoption of our technologies in developing countries.", "With that, I'd like to now turn it over to John for a closer look at our financials.", "John Ornell", "Okay. Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Fourth quarter sales increased by 13% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 23% at $1.38 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.12 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.36 this quarter compared to $1.08 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Review in Q4 sales results compared to Q4 last year. Sales were up 13% this quarter before currency translation, and currency translation was about neutral to sales growth this quarter. Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the United States were up 10%, Europe sales were up 5%, sales within Japan were up 4% and sales in Asia, outside of Japan, were up 32%. ", "Turning to the product front. Within the waters division, instrument system sales increased by 16% this quarter and recurring revenues grew by 10%. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 12% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q4 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in as expected at 60.9%. Product mix was favorably affected this quarter from Q3 by a ramp up in shipments of our new Xevo tandem quadruple systems. Additionally, we continue to see favorable manufacturing efficiencies and foreign currency translation, while less impactful to our top line than expected, remained favorable to our gross margin performance. ", "SG&A and R&D expenses increased somewhat more than expected this quarter as a result of much improved sales performance late in the year. The higher sales generated higher variable compensation expenses this quarter as many regions of the world exceeded their targets as we close the year. The 2009 basic comparison contained little incentive compensation as the vast majority of plans missed targets in 2009.", "Our full year effective income tax rate came in better than projected at about 15.5%. The restoration of the U.S. R&D tax credit and a continued shift in production levels in favor of our tax-advantaged geographies would boost our full-year 2010 tax rate versus forecast of the lower tax rate benefited the quarter by $0.06.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $946 million and debt totaled $766 million, bringing us to a net cash position of about $180 million.  On the stock buyback front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market. And during the fourth quarter, we purchased 665,000 shares of our common stock for $51 million. For the full year, we purchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock for $292 million.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. For Q4, free cash flow remained strong and came in at $127 million after funding $16 million of CapEx and adding back $6 million of non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation and $3 million related to the start of the building project of the U.K. Comparable free cash flow in Q4 last year was $112 million. For the full year, free cash flow came in a little better than expected at $409 million versus $372 million last year.", "Accounts receivable. Day sales outstanding stood at 67 days this quarter, down 10 days from the start of the quarter and comparable to Q4 last year. Inventories were up $26 million from the start of the year as a result of higher sales volume, increased demonstration inventory for new products and safety stock in the products being transferred to Singapore.", "Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance this year, and believe we are back on track to consistently deliver on our historical high single-digit top line and mid-teens growth in earnings per share. 2010 saw a return to more normal market conditions and large majority of our end markets. And our new product positions have been well received in all of our end markets. Gross margins have held up nicely this year in spite of large numbers of new products that generally negatively impact margins. Overall, SG&A and R&D increased about as expected this year as we made small investments in staff, largely in developing markets, and saw a variable pay programs kick back in from the depressed base in 2009. All of these led to an improvement in operating income performance this year. Operating income as a percent of sales grew by 70 basis points.", "Looking below the operating line. Our manufacturing strategy continue to benefit our tax rate and leverage from our share repurchase program in spite of higher interest costs all aided the full year and EPS growth of 19%.", "As we think about 2011, we see more stability in our end markets and continued momentum in the acceptance of our new products. We expect to see high single-digit sales growth for 2011, including about a point of growth from foreign currency translation. Currency fluctuations in the 2010 base periods will likely yield different growth rates by quarter in 2011 but net to about a point of growth for the full year.", "Moving down the P&L. Gross margins are expected to be up about 30 to 40 basis points this year as we continue to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and volume leverage, offsetting margin pressure from new product introductions. Currency at today's levels looks to be about neutral to gross margins for the full year. ", "Operating expenses are expected to grow at a slightly lesser rate than sales growth, interest expense is expected to be approximately $18 million and we expect our operating tax rate to be between 16% and 16.5%. This reflects a modest increase from 2010 resulting from an increase in our Irish tax rate from a contractual rate of 10% to a statutory rate of 12.5%. Our fully diluted average outstanding share count is expected to decrease by about 2 million shares in 2011. And rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70 for 2011.", "For Q1, we expect organic sales growth of about 8% to 9%, currency translation at today's levels is expected to add about 1% sales growth this quarter, bringing the quarterly growth to 9% to 10%.

Operator, at this time, I think we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Marshall Urist from Morgan Stanley.", "Neha Sahni - ", "Good morning. This is Neha Sahni, stepping in for Marshall. The first question we have is regarding your gross margin guidance in 2011 and whether you could give any more detail regarding your thoughts about the impact of product mix in mass spectrometry?", "John Ornell", "What we're expecting on the margin front is improvements associated, first off, with just manufacturing volume increases. The expectation is that we'll see higher levels of instrument production that generally supply leverage in our manufacturing facilities, and thus an improvement in gross margin from just volume. We're also expecting a higher mix of the tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry instruments in 2011 versus '10 that will favorably affect the mix from a product perspective on the mass spec side of the business. And we're also expecting a bit of favorability associated with the normalization on a number of products that have been transferred and ramped up in Singapore in the tail end of the second half of 2010 that we'll have a full year benefit in 2011. So all of those provide for a little bit more leverage in 2011 than we generally expect.", "Neha Sahni - ", "And just one more question regarding the Japanese stimulus benefit you've got in 1Q '10 and whether you'd be able to help quantify that or give us any more detail so we can help think about comps for 1Q '11?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?", "Neha Sahni - ", "We were just hoping to get more details regarding the Japanese stimulus benefit you saw in 1Q '10 and how that might have helped comps for 1Q '11?", "John Ornell", "Yes, we had a very, very strong finish to Japan's fiscal year in Q1 of 2010. You're right, there was some stimulus dollars there. We're expecting Japan to have a modest decline actually in the first quarter, and that's incorporated to the guidance that I provided you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Ross Muken of Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "We saw some really strong results out of some of the large chemicals houses this morning. And generally on a lot of the industrial end markets, we continue to see a bit of a pickup on CapEx spend. In terms of -- as we enter '11 from that customer base, what sort of the thought in terms of the continued momentum we've seen? And your belief that we can kind of sustain this sort of above average growth in the beginnings of an uptick in the economic cycle?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Ross, all indications are that we're going to see a continuation of good conditions in the industrial chemicals sector. We're certainly seeing strong indications of that through TA, both in terms of quotes and early ordering dynamics. That tends to be cyclical, as you know. But I think this cycle shows no signs of dropping in 2011.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "And maybe just quickly in terms of what you've seen in China specifically. Obviously, your x Japan growth in Asia was quite strong. If you sort of look at the various customer basis there, is there any specific area where you saw outsized growth there in India? Or was it really kind of broad based on the healthcare and industrial businesses?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, the answer is, it was kind of broad based. It was very strong continued in China. But I think every area in Asia continued strong. If there was a week point, it was in a small territory. I mean India, China, Taiwan, Korea, were all quite strong. And China continues to show sustainable strength across broad series of applications. It's not just pharma in China. A lot of food safety. A lot of environmental spending. It's probably our strongest quarter in China, and that was tough because the whole year was strong. So if anything, we built momentum in China as we went through the year.", "Operator", "Next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "In talking to you guys I'd say throughout at least for the second half, but now, a bit earlier in 2010. You guys made it very clear that if the demand trends remain as strong as they were developing throughout the year, then you would have to build up the sales and support infrastructure and debt. Your guidance suggests that this is indeed the plan for 2011. So would you be able to, I guess, first, confirm that and then maybe talk about geographic areas where you may be disproportionately directing higher in cuts or which maybe demonstrative of where demand is expected to be strongest in 2011?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure, Doug. I think clearly with the increase in the organic growth rate, we're seeing some pressure in terms of infrastructure spending or organizational spending. Will that affect us? Typically, the most is in the service organization where you uptick that level of instrument placements. And this is just only so many instruments one service guy can deal with. So while we came in to 2010 cautiously investing in that area, we definitely held back. And as we went through the year, we uptick in that area. And I'd say if you look at anyone departmental area of spending, it's going to be the service force that probably takes a bit of a disproportionate investment. Also through the sales force in these developing areas are expanding too. China, Korea, India are growing faster where areas of slower growth, particularly like Western Europe aren't getting much in the way of investment dollars. So that trends kind of baked into our guidance for 2011. We still think we'll -- our operating expenses will grow more slowly than the top line. We're probably a little bit cautious on that spend rate in terms of our estimates. Maybe it won't happen quite so fast as we currently anticipate. But we're providing for kind of a -- we don't want to be surprised on that front. So that's what our estimates anticipate.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Alliance still accounts for, I believe, the vast majority of your LC installed base. Almost a year into the H-Class launch, I guess, what percentage of the Alliance installed base do you think is realistic to be targeted for a conversion? And is there a goal that you targeted for conversion that's embedded into a guidance for 2011?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, currently, Alliance represents about half of the chromatography shipments. So ACQUITY has really come up in terms of the current level. And when you look at our worldwide business, India is certainly an important area for Alliance where those generic accounts have tended to stick with the traditional technology that was in the regulated methods that they adopted. Interestingly, we're even seeing in India what's the early phase of a move to the new technology in ACQUITY, and we think that's likely to pick up steam. Although, I still think that Alliance is going to be the predominant system of choice in India because of regulatory factors. I think what you're going to see over the next couple of years is that 50-50 split's going to move inexorably to something like 80-20 being ACQUITY. That certainly what we're seeing in the developed markets. We're seeing customers tell us things like they won't buy any more HPLC. They're only going to buy UPLC. And I think they mean it. I think the case for UPLC is so strong that we're seeing it move in that direction.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Peter Lawson from Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "I just wonder if you could talk to the [indiscernible] expected tax and what drove that benefit?", "John Ornell", "Sure. It was a re-enactment within the fourth quarter of the U.S. R&D tax credit. That's not quite half of the benefit that we saw, but it was meaningful to the quarter. That was re-enacted retroactively for 2010 and for 2011. So that's sort of going forward benefit as well. And then beyond that, we had significantly higher volumes of products that are coming both out of Singapore. And then, at the end of the quarter, out of Ireland as well as the TQ WEST new tandem triple quadrupole was transferred to Ireland and ramped up nicely at that facility. So both of those factors attributed to the benefit of the quarter.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "I wonder if I could get some further color on the large Pharma segment? It looks like it's growing. What's holding it back? And is that being helped by Asia as well?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, the large Pharma, the segment -- if you're talking about the 15 to 20 largest pharmaceutical accounts in our base grew in the fourth quarter, and that was the first time this year that they grew versus the same quarter in the previous year. It continues to be interesting where we have some accounts growing extraordinarily fast and others not investing very much at all. So it's really not a homogenous dynamic going on in those large accounts. And we also continue to see a number of those accounts using third parties, using CROs, investing in smaller biotech startups to do some of their early phase development. So as I've said time and again what the absolute measure here of large Pharma and whether we're scoring business in a large Pharma account or in a CRO can be somewhat misleading as to what their overall investment practice is. I think clearly the overall pharmaceutical marketplace, as maintained time and again, is pretty robust. The pharmaceutical customers grew at our corporate average in the fourth quarter. So we're pretty optimistic about that overall account and not specifically looking to whether it's one of the large ethical that is up or down this quarter.", "Operator", "Next question is from Jon Groberg of Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Doug, just one question for you. Your net cash -- your net debt position is now a net cash position and you had some dynamics in the industry with some competitors taken out. And I'm just curious I think you've kind of said steady as she goes with respect to capital deployment. I'm just curious as you look at '11, any desire to maybe be a bit more acquisitive? Or should we expect you to continue to be focused on buybacks primarily?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, John, we'd be delighted to be a bit more inquisitive if we could meet our standards. And, it's highly unlikely that we're going to make anything like a $1 billion acquisition whether return on capitals are negative. And of course, look, when current interest rates are LIBOR-plus pennies and then LIBOR is 1% or 2%, it's kind of easy to make many acquisitions accretive. But still if you put a real cost to long term cost to capital on those acquisitions, it's a head scratcher as to how you make it work over the long term. And any hiccup in doing that injects a whole hell lot of risk. So I look at doing that versus a business that's now growing solidly in the double digits, producing cash and a stock price that's abysmally low, of course. So I'd still rather, if the choice is to take high risk on a large acquisition or continue to do what we do well, it may sound boring but I think that's what you can look for.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Amit Bhalla from Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Question on Europe. I know you've, in the past, made comments a more cautious outlook on Europe. So I was hoping in the quarter you could just kind of parse out Western and Eastern Europe across your different end markets and just talk to us about the outlook there?", "John Ornell", "Sure. We look at Europe in sum total; it did overall better than we thought. Kind of as expected though, Eastern Europe continues to be the star overall though in that group. That being said though, we did see positive growth within some of the larger geographies, Germany and France were actually up in the quarter, as with Spain surprisingly. We still see pressure in U.K., Switzerland, the Netherlands had a difficult quarter. But we've seen generally an improvement certainly at some of the larger countries within Western Europe. Eastern Europe, on the other hand, continues to do extremely well, very good growth in places like Poland, Hungary, Russia. We're seeing a broad series of opportunities in Eastern Europe that don't appear at all to be slowing down. So our expectation going into next year is to continue to see Eastern Europe but drive the overall growth for that portion of the world. But we do expect also to see Western Europe improve as we make our way across the year.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "And then a follow up just in terms of pricing. Can you just comment on UPLC pricing? I believe ASP was probably down in the last quarter, but your volumes has been pretty strong. So can you comment on pricing on UPLC as well as just pricing on the high end mass spec market?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think your impression is wrong. The overall pricing of our ACQUITY product is held.", "John Ornell", "The H-Class is out there to premium to the Alliance. The initial UPLC ACQUITY is still at a premium to that. The thing that we're grappling with there is really a mix between the base Alliance of the H-Class that's selling at a premium to the Alliance and the research grade initial ACQUITY product. And we're not seeing a deterioration in the ASPs across that, but we are seeing a mix change with more sales obviously of H-Class and it's higher proportion of the mix. And Alliance becomes a lower portion of the mix overall, but it's not a pricing dynamic as much as just a product mix dynamic.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "And pricing on the high end mass spec, I believe there's some competitive pricing going on out there?", "John Ornell", "I'd say, on high end mass spec. The good news for us on that front is that we've recently come out with the TQ west. That's providing a very nice margin for the business. You saw the benefit on the gross margins overall in Q4 through shifting that product back into the mix in the quarter. The high end series of by competition that exists with our Q top offering, there's a bit more of a competitive scenario right now. We're very comfortable with our product position. We're holding the margin on those products. Some of the newer high-end top products have a bit more cost than the products that they replaced. So they have a little bit of margin issue perhaps versus some of the triple, quadruple products that come out of the gate with some very nice margins. But I would say that the pricing dynamic is pretty constant across the quarter. We're not seeing anything that's more intense or less intense than was there when we started the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tony Butler of Barclays Capital.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "With respect to the H-Class, could you characterize the rough estimate on a percentage basis of new non-Waters customers that may be adopting the H-Class? And second, could you also characterize the attachment rates of consumables to the H-Class? I think normally an HPLC may expect something around 30% to 40%, but are you seeing higher attachment rate on the H-Class?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure, Tony. Maybe Art can chime in on the H-Class.", "Arthur Caputo", "The H-Class sales, Tony, between a third and a half of our H-Class sales are in fact due to new customers that were not prior Waters customers. So we've been quite successful with that particular product of converting new business.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Just to be sure, Tony, that isn't a compex. That might be a laboratory that hasn't bought from us before. Within a customer that maybe has some Waters users, but a new laboratory.", "Arthur Caputo", "And the attachment rate as far as consumables is holding as about the same rate as our regional research ACQUITY offering, which appears to be running in the 80% to 90% range in terms of use of UPLC. Now qualify that, and that some of the per customer offering the H-Class does HPLC and UPLC. While a very high percentage in excess of 90% ultimate intent is to run UPLC on the system. They may spend an interim period doing HPLC while they prepare for the conversion. So in that case, they will use the chemistries that they were using for the prior HPLC application.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "And Doug, one follow-up, if I may. A number of competitors also speak about food safety in emerging markets. Could you provide some color around the competitive situation? And one would argue that it would be somewhat difficult to penetrate in the Chinese market with premium-price instruments and high margins. How do you think about that?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think it is a competitive marketplace, no question about it. I think we have some advantages, particularly in the emerging U.S. market but it's early there. And time will tell whether what we've done there prepares the past or the future. But we're optimistic about that. In terms of China, across the broad application space whether it's food safety, pharmaceutical or environmental applications or classic industrial. Our pricing in China holds up at the same level or at the same prices essentially that we're seeing in the rest of the world. We don't see end market pricing and in fact in market profitability, if anything, we see it on the plus side. So this notion that the Chinese are extraordinarily priced, they're value-conscious. They want the best product they can get. We find that they want the highest technology products at the same rate that the customers do everywhere else. So this notion that they might value price over and above other characteristics, frankly, we don't see it. And, boy, at the rate that our Chinese business is growing it would be hard to say that we're growing disproportionately slowly.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jon Wood of Jefferies.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "John, can you just go through the free cash flow outlook on 2011 and then talk about the elevated spending on CapEx around the micro mass facility? Is that expected to be significant this year and how will it kind of flow the next couple?", "John Ornell", "For 2011, I think that our free cash flow is likely to approach about $450 million, excluding anything that we might do on the U.K. facility. That would be about $510 million in cash from ops and somewhere around $60 million or so CapEx. As it relates to the U.K. building in sum total over the course of multiple years, that's at $85 million, $90 million below or so investment. We've done very little to date. And the expectation is we may see somewhere between maybe $20 million and up to $25 million depending on how far we get in CapEx in 2011 associated with that building. It would not be included in the numbers I just provided you.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then, Doug, given your cash position and kind of the cash flow outlook here, why not do repurchases more in line with free cash flow at this point? Are you seeing more M&A at current that you did in 2010 on average?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I'd say it's may be a little bit richer opportunity. But I think it's fair to say we re-evaluate the level of our share purchases at least annually. Last year, we used about three quarters of our free cash flow to do the buybacks. It's not inconceivable that we won't take that up a notch going forward. And the Board will take up the level of stock repurchases during the first half of this year. So I think it's a fair question. And I think you could look for us to update that as we go through 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Derik De Bruin of UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "On the H-Class, what's the exchange rate? That is -- are you getting a 1-for-1 swap for the HPLCs or were just given the higher throughput for the UPLC, is it more like a 2-for-1?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes it's early right now, Derik. It's a very fair question because the productivity of UPLC is clearly higher than traditional HPLC. We're early in the conversion cycle. So you're seeing, frankly, a lot of these systems go into methods development. And so at the early phase the methods development labs have to prove the transition of the method before they move aggressively into those QC applications. So right now, I'd say it's not a 2-for-1. It's probably more of a 1-for- -- just buying a one or two or these and not necessarily replacing too many HPLCs in their labs. But when we move into, full bore into QC it's probably something around the 2-for-1 mix.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "So I've always worked within a number that about 60% of your overall HPLC installed base is in the QC environment. Is that a fair number still?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Art, what would you say, is that still currently a fair or it's a little high?", "Arthur Caputo", "It probably is at 30% to 40%.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Given the growth of the applied markets, what's your general revenue exposure? I mean how much of your business would you say is dedicated to environmental? How much is it to food?", "John Ornell", "I'd say the environmental piece is probably maybe 7%, Doug, overall. Food safety is probably maybe 5% to 7%, somewhere in that range. So between the two, you're somewhere around 12%, 13% maybe.", "Operator", "Next question is from Quintin Lai of Robert Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "The success that you're seeing in the uptake of H-Class in the regulatory market, are you seeing any opportunities to cross-sell maybe like your new triple quad into those markets now that you've gained maybe some new account traction?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think it's a very fair question. The regulated drug metabolism in Pharmacokinetics segment of the market is a very large mass spectrometry marketplace. In a period of transition, so you've got many of these big pharmas looking to outsource some of those products. You've got CROs investing in new facilities. So it's a period of change in a lot of those environments. And we're coming to the market I think with both ACQUITY and TQ WEST that rival the best performance instruments in those applications. So I think a good opportunity for us that still awaits. We're seeing some good symptoms of penetration that could happen there. We're not declaring victory by any stretch of the imagination yet. But I think it's an opportunity to get additional growth that we're not ready to bank on yet, but I think is a real opportunity for us.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just wanted to dig up a little bit more into the mix use of the HPLC versus UPLC columns that you mentioned for H-Class. I'm wondering if you could maybe give us a sense of what that mix looks like today on a dollar basis and then how you think that's going to shift over the next one to two years?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I'm sorry a dollar base? You mean like come, Mike?", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I think you mentioned something like 80% to 90% of your new H-Class installations are using some UPLC columns. But I'm wondering if you could maybe quantify what the dollar mix is between the UPLC versus HPLC columns today and where that's going to go over the next couple?", "John Ornell", "They are actually quite close. The average price for the UPLC column was about -- I think about it's $500 whereas you're probably closer to the $300, $350 range for an HPLC column. So it's the premium to the UPLC column. But over time, we think UPLC columns will hold the premium. The fact is that we've seen lifetimes for UPLC columns that are at least equal, in some cases, even better than HPLC columns. And the performance, of course, is what's justifying the higher value of the UPLC column. And we're going to hold over time.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "If you're looking for an underlying growth rate, Isaac, the UPLC columns are, by far, the fastest growing segment of our Consumables business. And we've gone from nothing to almost $30 million of revenue there. And that's a base level of that grows, we think continues to grow 30% to 40% over the foreseeable future whereas the rest of our chemical product, as you know, as a group, grow more in the high single digits to 10% range.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then maybe just secondly on the mass spec position, you did mention SYNAPT. I'm wondering you have touched a little bit on your product introductions as you progresses. Could you maybe walk us through what to expect as we head into ASMS and maybe the rest of the year?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, the SYNAPT has an outstanding year. And if you look at the whole family of high end QToF SYNAPT products, it was an extraordinary year for revenue growth there. Now to be fair, that was more of a late 2009, 2010 dynamic as we move later in this year the TQ west took more predominance. But we think the high end was particularly strong in the fourth quarter continues to be very robust. We continue to expand that family of products. Our most recent introduction was a single stage ToF mass spec that we're very optimistic about for benchtop applications. So I think that's what's going to take most of the new product emphasis this year as we still think that SYNAPT product line is very young in the two.", "Operator", "Next question is from Dan Leonard of Leerink Swann.", "Daniel Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC", "In the past, you've talked about the ACQUITY H-Class tripling the penetration of historical ACQUITY classic into the regulated applications. Could you update us on that metric to that hold in the fourth quarter, to that increase decelerate?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I'm sorry could you repeat that, Dan?", "Daniel Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC", "I believe that maybe only 10% of your ACQUITY classic sales were into the regulated pharmaceutical quality control applications whereas the proportion of H-Class sales have been much higher. Can you I guess update us on that ratio please for the fourth quarter?", "John Ornell", "Basically what we've seen it holding. We find the H-Class is now dominated in what you've described as development applications through manufacturing QA. The traditional ACQUITY, it's still people using it for whatever reason in the developmental areas. And originally we had people putting that product into the quality control areas before we introduce the H-Class. But the bulk is still holding up 90% and the primary focus of the traditional ACQUITY is more in the Discovery front end research.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "And certainly, in high sensitivity mass spec applications, the traditional ACQUITY is the instrument of choice.", "Arthur Caputo", "I find most people will use it preferred the ACQUITY.", "Daniel Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC", "And then, just a housekeeping question for John. John, the $18 million interest expense forecast for 2011, is that a net number, net of any small interest you earned on your cash so that would compared to the 12?", "John Ornell", "That's a net number. It's up a bit year-over-year as we continue to move some of our debt portfolio into private placement fixed interest rate instruments.", "Operator", "Next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On TQS, you may talked about a pretty broad range of application areas when you launched the product. Can you just characterize where you're seeing the strong interest, whether it's in the applied markets or infectious disease or biomedical?", "Arthur Caputo", "The TQS is fairly broad in its area of applications. So any one particular area doesn't seem to stand out, very broadly used. We see it used in the food applications. Environmental applications, certainly in the biomedical. We're seeing a very strong response in the regulated bioanalysis areas. So it's not hard to really draw a specific segment. The performance of the product is such that it is quickly become taken on a leading position of what you described as high-performance triple quadrupole. We obviously are trying to target was mentioned a few minutes ago very heavily into the regulated bioanalysis area. We see that combined with our ACQUITY positions offering a substantial opportunity for us. But its performance has been broadly based across a wide range of applications. Hard to single out any one of them.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then, in the prepared comments. Doug, you called out the new biologic characterization instrument or solution, I guess. As we think about where you're going from an R&D perspective, you've kind of refreshed the whole mass spec portfolio in the past couple of years and obviously you've had some success with UPLC products. Is there more of a focus on kind of application-specific methods here going forward and kind of more focused approaches as you target a broader range of customers?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think it's fair to say that we're doing a lot of work on applications such as biologicals in particular. I mean I think one of the reasons we focus there is because there's not a pharmaceutical institution around the world who isn't saying that their R&D and their future depends on large molecule versus their traditional small molecule world. And large molecules require different treatments, different systems, different kinds of separations to do them successfully. So we're clearly looking there and, boy, I think the fact that we introduced this new system is interesting but we've been having great success in the biopharmaceuticals piece of the pharma market over the last year or two, particularly in proteomics and in metabinomix. We're seeing a great deal of success there. I think it will be wrong, however, to think that we're not still continuing to invest substantial money in basic instrument systems, enhancements and more than enhancements but next generations of separations and detection. I think you'll be interested, we're not ready to open the komono [ph] too much on that. But throughout this year and into the next year, I wouldn't have you believe that we're just looking at application development. You're going to see a lot of core instrument development also come to the market.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then just last one last one on pharma, I appreciate the color you gave before. But as we think about the prospect of a replacement cycle, there's obviously a lot going on between these mergers and more outsourcing. I guess what's your confidence level that you will start to see the replacement cycle pick up over the next couple of years? Or are we in an environment where you just don't have that visibility right now?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I would say that I don't think we have seen a lot of evidence that we're in a major replacement cycle as we speak, maybe a little bit. But I think what we're seeing is the market respond to UPLC and the need to get facilitize on this technology, and I think we're at the front end of that. And to some extent, I think that caused us some delays within some customers as they say, \"How quickly am I prepared to invest down that road and how do I deal with my facilities and people issues.\" But UPLC has very strong ROIs. And as you know a lot of these, particularly big pharmas are extraordinarily focused on ROIs now rather than kind of blue sky new product promises. So we think that the market is poised to move into a replacement cycle. It's going to be somewhat masked by the move. It's not going to be a classic, \"Well I had my old system and I've been in the market for five years with it and people are going to just buy more of those\". Because they're going to be, at the same time, moving to a new technology called UPLC. But we're optimistic, but we're not probably going to formally incorporate that into our estimates until we can prove that we've seen the beginning of it happening. And that will take a while longer.", "Operator", "Next question is from Stephen Unger with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Stephen Unger - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "John, as far as recurring revenue growth is concerned for next year, do you expect that to grow faster than Instruments sales given the strong Instruments sales of 2010?", "John Ornell", "I think high single-digit expectation; you're going to see pretty comparable growth across recurring revenues in instrumentation. I mean certainly to the extent that we continue to maybe see a little upside from what we're describing is most likely to be with instrument placements and not the recurring revenue side.", "Stephen Unger - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "And then given the strong sales in the quarter, was there a meaningful carryover of orders into the first quarter? And then, how is manufacturing keeping up with demand?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I'd say the strength we saw across the fourth quarter was encouraging in that it was relatively consistent, and we've seen that strength continue principally right through the first few weeks of this quarter. So that trend continues, it's encouraging. And we do think we're kind of back to a bit more normalcy as we look across the various markets, and are pretty comfortable that our product positions will allow us to capture some meaningful share here. What was the second part of your question?", "Stephen Unger - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Just house manufacturing?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Manufacturing is doing well in keeping up. The good news there is that we've got some pretty robust products that are making their way through the R&D process, through new product introduction and ramping up nicely in manufacturing. We had a little bit of a delay in ramping up the TQS. That has gone extremely well. That product has no further delays and there aren't any other products that as we speak have any manufacturing issues. So we're comfortable from a product supply position that we're not looking at issues today.", "Operator", "Next question is from Paul Knight, CLSA.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "What's your view on Asia, Doug, in terms of -- is it a secular growth story? Or how much of it is cyclical? How much is the customer base there industrial users?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Some segments of the market are more industrial. Historically, Korea has been more industrial. But I'd say that is changing, and the mix of business that we're seeing in Korea is moving more to a more of a traditional pharmaceutical Life Science focus. China is a pretty balanced marketplace, with probably a higher percentage of food and food safety and agricultural applications and environmental than we're seeing in other areas of the world. And I think that's going to continue, Paul. If you look at the amount of requests we get in China to look at specific environmental projects, say, testing of river waters, looking at affluent. Not all of them get funded at the pace that we'd like. But a lot of them happen. And boy, we continue to see a lot of new things coming on the plate that weren't there last quarter. So I think, the Asia development -- and by the way, I think Latin America is, in particularly places like Brazil, are just a smidge behind, very rapid growth, very clear signals of continuing investment in agriculture, food safety and pharmaceuticals. I don't see any significant cyclicality in these high-growth markets.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then lastly on the interest expense line, is because the cash in bonds is rolling in to lower yielding instruments, is that what's going on?", "John Ornell", "Actually on that front, the issue is that we have a bank agreement that expires at the end of this year. So we've been going through a process of diversifying into private placement debt instruments that have between a five- and 10-year tenure and fixed interest rates between about 3.5% and 5%. So we've been slowly moving a portion of our debt portfolio into these fixed-rate instruments that have raised the debt cost a bit in the short-term, and that's causing the $18 million.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "That dynamics there, Paul, is that, of course, you pay a penalty. Because under our current agreements here, you're paying LIBOR plus pennies, and that's very, very cute, but it's not going to last forever. So if you stay linked to that until the bitter end, then you're at the subject of long-term interest rates that could be much higher. So John has let us, done in the past, is diversifying our debt into more permanent instruments, and we think that was the most prudent thing to do even though we paid the short-term penalty on the interest costs.", "Operator", "The last question is from Sung Ji Nam of Gleacher.", "Sung Ji Nam - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "I was wondering if you could give us some more color on your Academic segment, understanding that's not your obviously your largest segment. But given pretty solid demand touched nearly in U.S. and Europe, just wondering if there was any trailing benefit that is from the stimulus? Or what you're seeing there?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Trailing benefit from what? Stimulus? We clearly saw some stimulus benefit last year in Japan. I'd say it was hard to see much stimulus benefit anywhere else in our Worldwide business. If it was there, it was indirect. And nothing much we could directly point to. Overall, our Academic business in the fourth quarter grew in the mid-single digits. And it was softest in Japan. That can be pretty cyclical in how the Japanese budgets work. We're a little careful about the Academic Government Business in Europe because we know that budgets are under pressure and we know that make itself else in lower government support for academic research. Frankly, we haven't seen that dynamic yet, but it's kind of what we're being careful about.", "Operator", "And there are no other questions at this time.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you very much for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters division; and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "As is our normal practice, I'll start with an overview of the quarter's highlights and John will follow with details on our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for Q2 and full year 2011. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that the actual events or results may differ materially.", "For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, under the caption Business Risk Factors. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled earnings release conference call and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for July 2011.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to our company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operation, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share included in this morning's press release.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well, we're very pleased with our first quarter results and encouraged by the broad strength that we saw across our product lines, geographies and markets. The trend of improving end markets and strong acceptance of our new systems that we've now seen over multiple quarters is very encouraging. ", "During this quarter, our organic sales growth was 14%, and we delivered 28% adjusted earnings per share growth due primarily to strong shipment volume and effective expense leverage. Instrument sales, that is the hardware sales, grew organically at more than 20%, led by continued rapid uptake of our ACQUITY H-Class UPLC and Xevo UPLC/MS Systems. ", "As you may recall, we began shipping our H-Class UPLC system in the first quarter of 2010. And during the past year, H-Class has been a remarkable success for us, as we've seen consistent and growing demand for this innovative system across our customer segments and especially among our pharmaceutical users, as they've upgraded their laboratories.", "Bringing in our business geographically, I'd like to start off by speaking about our situation in Japan. Most important, we are grateful that our employees are safe, and we are not aware of casualties among our many loyal customers. The resiliency of our staff and their dedication to ensuring the continued operation of instrumentation in our customers' labs has been very impressive. For weeks, they've endured disruptions in electrical power and in the public transportation system while working long hours under extremely stressful conditions. We're thankful for these extraordinary efforts and certainly continue to keep all of the people in Japan in our thoughts and prayers through these trying times.", "During the first quarter, our sales in Japan were roughly flat against a very difficult basic comparison. You may recall, we benefited from significant government stimulus demand in Japan during the first quarter of 2010. In fact, for the quarter, our sales volume was in line with the expected demand included in our January guidance. ", "Moving forward, we remain concerned about the situation in Japan, but are hopeful that the most difficult conditions impacting our business may be behind us. Adjusting for currency, Japan has represented about 10% of our sales. And at this time, we have only marginally reduced our revenue outlook for the full year. However, a further deterioration of infrastructure in the country is a potential risk to our business that we will continue to monitor as the year goes by. ", "Our business in Asia, outside of Japan, performed very well in the quarter, especially in China and India. Our business in India benefited -- excuse me, our business in China benefited from significant governmental investment in instrumentation accompanied by strong broad underlying business growth. In India, sales of instruments for QC testing to support generic drug manufacturing were augmented by a nice pickup in demand for mass spectrometry, mass spectrometry-based systems for a variety of research and testing applications.", "Coming into this year, we have been somewhat concerned about demand in Europe for new instrument systems as general economic conditions there appear to be somewhat fragile. Having those expectations, we were pleased with our sales growth in the first quarter. ", "In Western Europe, pharmaceutical and applied chemical analysis sales, largely driven by our new mass spectrometry systems were particularly strong. University and governmental spending, a concern for us given publicized austerity measures showed reasonable growth in the quarter. In addition, our Eastern European markets delivered another strong quarterly performance with nice double digit year-over-year sales growth.", "Finally, looking at sales in the Americas, developing markets in South America continued to deliver a strong double-digit growth, while in the U.S., pharmaceutical and applied chemical analysis sales more than offset expected weaker [ph] combined government and university shipments.", "Continuing to review the Waters division business. As many of you know, the broadly defined pharmaceutical market has historically accounted for more than half of Waters sales and accordingly it has been a significant factor in our success and a consistent focus of our product development and marketing efforts. ", "Over the last few quarters, I've spoken to you about early trends signaling a recovery in pharmaceutical spending for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry technologies. In addition, we have over the past year introduced significant new instrument systems well suited for applications that span the drug discovery development and quality control processes.", "While in the first quarter, our level of confidence in a meaningful recovery of pharmaceutical spending improved further, as sales to this segment grew even faster than our overall revenue. Looking more closely at our breakdown of pharma sales, the strength was very broad as generics, CROs and our larger ethical [ph] accounts all delivered strong double-digit growth.", "As I mentioned earlier, our newer system offerings, including the ACQUITY H-Class and our Xevo MS Systems helped accelerate our business in the quarter. And I'll now mention that a significant proportion of that growth was for pharmaceutical applications. Our outlook for the remainder of this year assumes that we will continue to benefit from a healthy level of demand from our pharmaceutical customers, as we feel capital budgets are in place and that our current and upcoming new products will generate healthy order flow. ", "On the new product front, we have planned significant new instrument system introductions during the first half of this year. At this year's Pittsburgh conference, in early March, significant launches included a new supercritical fluid chromatography platform for analytical SSC applications that leverages design and performance features of our ACQUITY UPLC system. This system was introduced with a suite of new SSC columns based on our small particle UFC technology -- UPLC, excuse me. ", "At the conference, we also showcased a new analytical systems specifically targeted at biopharmaceutical applications. This new system brings together our ACQUITY UPLC separations technology with a new high performance Xevo time-of-flight mass spectrometer, all running under a new software offering that we have called UNIFI.", "UNIFI is a key new operating system that uniquely brings together key workflow functionality from our successful Empower, MassLynx and the Genesis software platforms. In this first commercial embodiment of UNIFI, it enables an easy-to-use system solution that is designed to help UPLC/MS migrate more easily from research to quality control applications or bio synthesized pharmaceuticals. ", "Our plan is to gradually expand the range of tailored systems utilizing UNIFI and at this year's upcoming ASMS Conference in Denver, we plan to speak about future systems offerings that leverage this unique and leading software capability. ", "I'll also tell you that this year's ASMS is likely to be a very exciting event for Waters as significant product launches are planned and many technical presentation highlighting new applications will be presented by our scientific staff.", "Return to our TA Instruments division. Sales grew at 12% organically for the quarter. Its performance was highlighted by strong growth in developing markets, new applications for thermal systems, particularly in the energy area and for biocalorimetry instruments. ", "During the quarter, TA saw a strong demand for its new discovery DSC [Differential Scanning Calorimeters ] system. The strong demand in combination with new product launches planned for this year suggests that 2011 can again be a strong year for our TA division. ", "On the financial front, our confidence of the top line growth for 2011 has resulted in plans to selectively increase our internal spending. To support higher shipment levels of new instrument systems, we have begun to modestly increase our field staffing levels, especially in developing markets.", "Generally, we have and will continue to plan for overall annual organic expense growth but are slower than our top line growth and in this way create meaningful leverage to ensure that our operating income will grow faster than our revenues. ", "As a management team, we have always focused on strong cash generation as we feel it is a metric that best measures the strength and efficiency of any business. Now I'm happy to tell you that our free cash flow in the quarter was an impressive $112 million. A rate of about $0.25 for each sales dollar.", "So in closing, I'd like to say that we're encouraged by our start to 2011. We feel that the factors that drove growth in the first quarter are largely sustainable, that our new product pipeline will enhance our competitive position, and our strategy of focusing on select technology and faster growing end markets will allow us to continue to deliver superior top line and bottom line performance. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to John for a look at our financial analysis.", "John Ornell", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. First quarter sales increased by 16% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 28% at $1.04 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.81 last year. ", "On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.01 this quarter versus $0.79 last year and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning. ", "Reviewing Q1 sales results in comparison to Q1 last year, sales were up 16% with currency translation contributing 2 points to the sales growth. This result is much better than we expected as our customers capital spending started of the year stronger than forecast, especially in our pharmaceutical end markets. ", "Looking out our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 8%, Europe sales were up 12%, Japan was down 1% and sales in Asia, outside of Japan, were up 29%. ", "Turning to the product front, within the Waters Instruments -- within the Waters division. Instrument system sales increased by 23% and recurring revenues grew 7% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 12% versus prior year. ", "Now I would like to comment on our Q1 non-GAAP reported financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in at 60.3%, the same as Q1 last year. The positive effects of manufacturing cost reductions and volume leverage were offset by unfavorable currency comparisons this quarter. ", "SG&A and R&D expenses increased about as expected, and this quarter's double-digit growth percentages were affected by difficult base of comparison where in early 2010 discretionary spending was constrained exiting the recession of 2009. ", "Our full year effective income tax rate came in at expected at about 16.5%. On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.04 billion and debt totaled $790 million, bringing us to a net cash position of about $250 million. ", "During the quarter, we closed on an additional $200 million of term debt refinancing in the private placement market, taking advantage of market conditions that allowed us to layer 5, 7 and 10-year financing at fixed rates that averaged 3.2%. ", "As for share repurchases, the board of directors approved a new $500 million 2-year repurchase program. And in the first quarter, we bought 847,000 shares of our common stock for $67 million. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. For Q1, free cash flow remained strong and came in at $112 million, after funding $17 million of CapEx and adding back $6 million of noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. ", "Comparable free cash flow in Q1 last year was $95 million. Accounts receivable, days sales outstanding stood at 74 days this quarter, down 4 days from Q1 last year. Inventories typically rise in the first quarter from year-end levels and were up $20 million this quarter. Currency translation accounts for about $6 million of this increase.", "Overall, we are pleased with our financial performance as we start this year, consistent with the improving trend, we saw our developing across 2010. Our first quarter's result indicate more normal market conditions in the majority of our end markets and our new product positions have been well received in key application areas.  Operating margin improved by 170 basis points this quarter as we saw a continued strength in our gross margins and significant leverage about our operating expenses. ", "Continued execution in our share repurchase program and a lower tax rate added to the operational results of the business and together resulted in a 28% growth in our fully diluted earnings per share this quarter. As we think about the remainder of 2011, we continue to see stability in our end markets and continued momentum in the acceptance of our new products. We expect to see around a 10% growth in sales for full year 2011 before currency translation. And at today's rates, currency is likely to add about 2 points to reported sales growth for the full year.", "Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the full year are expected to be between 60.5% and 61%, as we continue to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and volume leverage, offsetting margin pressures from new product introductions. Currency at today's levels, looks to be a modest to present to gross margins in the first half of the year and favorable later in the year. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a lesser rate than sales growth. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $18 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to be about 16.5%. ", "Our fully diluted average outstanding share count is likely to decrease by about 1.5 million shares in 2011. Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 per share. ", "For Q2, we expect organic sales growth of about 10%. Currency translation at today's level is expected to add about 5% to sales growth this quarter, bringing reported revenue growth to about 15%. We expect to see continued operating income expansion this quarter and plan to proceed in our share repurchase under our newly authorized $500 million program. All of this is expected to result in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of between $1.10 and $1.15 per fully diluted share.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. At this point, I think we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Quintin Lai of Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "So very encouraging to hear that pharma, CapEx is continuing its trend. Through the quarter, I think clients were concerned about the headline news of some of the big pharma companies laying people off. Could you talk a little bit about where that demand -- You kind of say that was very broad base, but is this a return to a more normalized growth Or are we just coming off of tough comps? In your opinion, Doug.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, Quintin, depending on how you cut the term pharma. For large, the top 15 to 20 accounts, it's been a continuing story of tough conditions over at least a 5-year period. So I don't think we're going to say that -- maybe one quarter we would had a peak or something. But generally, it's been a tough time, particularly as they have outsourced some of the R&D or manufacturing analysis to CROs. Some of its gone generic. So you've seen our Indian business pickup. But I think, we have at times said the large research-based pharmaceutical companies have continued to kind of go down a track that sooner or later ought to kind of add methodically, flatten out and perhaps begin to pick up. We think that, that's probably happening. We think that, that install base has -- we have got a lot of old equipment in it that needs to be upgraded. There's a limit to which some of these laboratories can go where they cannot utilize some of those older systems. And we think we're seeing some symptoms of that in those large research-based pharma accounts. To look more broadly, I think as we've said for many years now, the overall broad pharma industry, pretty healthy. And again, it's kind of hard to tell sometimes when you're growing substantially your CRO business whether their clients are Pfizer or Glaxo [GlaxoSmithKline] or Bristol-Myers. So I think it's a little bit more diffused now. But where the benefit lies is probably still with some of those big pharma accounts. So we continue to see very good strong business from those CROs, as well as during a time when we're seeing good conditions from our research-based pharmaceuticals.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Doug Schenkel, Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Thanks for taking my question. I guess a question on H-Class. Is there any way to describe how H-Class is varying and say expanding biopharma markets? So I guess what I'm thinking about kind of generics and CROs and India and China versus traditional pharma accounts where you're actually replacing instruments. I guess I'm just trying to get at how much of the growth is driven by an actual replacement cycle versus market expansion in certain parts of the world?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Art, do you want to give some color on that?", "Arthur Caputo", "Yes, Doug. It turns out it's fairly balanced with H-Class. The primary position of H-Class was to bring UPLC downstream into the more routine developmental areas. And that's been the case. Additionally, we introduced a inert [ph] H-Class for the biopharmaceutical segment. So one of the things we've been doing with UPLC is to -- after having spend several years in the developmental side of building the confidence of the technology with our Class ACQUITY was to be ready when they said, 'Okay, we're going to push this into border utilization.' So with H-Class, what we're experiencing is a lot of generic adoption, a lot of adoption in large pharma, quality control, CROs are starting to look at the technology. And in particular, the mass spectrometry driven application, where you see a lot of use in regulated bioanalysis, it turns out over the past several years that UPLC has essentially been adopted as a de facto front end to a mass spectrometer because of the characteristics of extremely small sample volumes, the flows are very amenable to how a mass spectrometry develops its operational capabilities. So I have to say that the most exciting part of our H-Class success has been its broad-based adoption. And it went beyond utilization just in the manufacturing segment we're seeing it used much broadly. And we see no end in sight -- with the order sizes are increasing. Where large multiples, which for us, as is a combination of replacement going on as well as people looking at the developmental areas, using it for new applications. So we have to claim it to be a broader penetration in this particular segment.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. That's interesting and helpful. And then maybe if I can sneak in one more. Maybe just turning to Japan, which is obviously been an area of focus for many. Any chance you would provide some detail on how business trended over the last few weeks of the quarter and what's been going on in the first few weeks of April? And I guess more broadly, has there been any communication from the government there that would suggest there is a business opportunity for you, as Japan presumably invest more in enhanced water and food testing?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think what we're willing to say is that, the tsunami and the earthquake effects did not -- maybe showed -- we were frankly running a little bit stronger than we expected in Japan through the middle part of the quarter. We were expecting probably a little bit of upside over our core forecast. And with the tsunami and the earthquake, that probably came back to our original expectation. It wasn't a big dynamic, but it was a little bit slower than it probably otherwise would have been. We're seeing so far, as we go into the second quarter, no real significant influence or downside from the tsunami and all of its various side effects. As it relates to what the ultimate effects will be, I think we're expecting that there was damage to laboratories and upset to laboratory instruments in the quake area that will have to be rectified. We've already received some notification of that from our laboratories. We expect that there will be some additional testing. But I think it's way too early to see how the government shakes out on that. It's also probably important to notice that most of our business is not conducted in the tsunami and main quake areas. As you think about Japan, you have the East of Japan, which includes Tokyo. In the West, generally considered Osaka. More of our business is in the West, very little of our business is in the Fukushima area where the tsunami and the quake was centered. So we're not expecting to see long significant effects in our business given the current state of affairs in Japan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amit Bhalla, Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "I wanted you to just expand on your comments about the U.S. market specifically in the government and academic sectors. I think you mentioned that it was a little bit weaker than the other end markets.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "John, I think you've made the comment about the academics.", "John Ornell", "Yes. I mean, government and academic really in the quarter, the dynamic there was just more outside Japan in its orientation with a large amount of shipments that went out in Q1 last year when we really pushed our new G2 product into that market space. You know we had a low to mid-single digit expectation for government and academic. That was principally what we got. As you know, we don't have a large exposure to any particular government organization, NIH, as an example, is maybe $10 million to $15 million for full year business that we do. There might have been a little bit of U.S. stimulus business in the base. So I'd say overall, I think the result was pretty much on plan and while our expectations going forward is kind of low to mid single-digit growth of this, given the products that we're offering and just given the fact that these businesses have to be constrained with all of the things that we read about budget woes around the world.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, John, and then just one additional question on Europe. Last quarter, the chemical and applied markets were growing a little slower than your other end markets. And this quarter, it looked like that turned around. Could you just expand a little bit more about the chemical and applied markets in Europe?", "John Ornell", "Yes, I would say -- particularly as you look at Europe, the real strength that came through there is comparable to what Doug had said regarding pharma, and that is the large [ph] pharma accounts did very well. That really did drive the growth in Europe. The applied markets did well in Europe. And I'd say, the chemical, industrial space was slower. So that type of performance, overall, that we saw in Europe that led to overall a surprisingly good result, I'll say it's 12% for the overall geography.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jon Wood, Jefferies.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Thanks. Doug or John, is it possible, you mentioned the Instrument business up 23%, obviously, pretty elevated there. Can you tease out LC versus MS just qualitatively which major category grew faster?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes. Basically, Jon, they both grew north of 20% very similar growth rate. And we think they're largely, that's indicative of the strength of both product lines. It's not one dragging the other. They're both showing independent strength. And it is kind of indicative of our system strategy. Although not all LCs are sold with mass specs or vice versa. But it is, I think, a very clear sign of the strength of our systems offerings.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "All right. Great. Thanks for that. And last one, on the buyback, so it looks like a little bit slower in the first quarter than is traditional. Are you guys still expected to do about 100% of free cash flow towards that buyback for all of 2011? And then as kind of an adjunct to that, any update to that free cash flow guidance at this point?", "John Ornell", "We had indicated the original guidance had assumed somewhere around $250 million of buyback. We look to retain some amount of cash should an acquisition come up, particularly early in the year where we don't know what we might find. So I would characterize the Q1 level of buyback as being at least on that plan, actually ahead of that plan on a dollar basis. We're looking to generate somewhere close to $450 million of free cash flow. If we don't find M&A targets as the year goes on, we'll look to perhaps deploy that cash more incrementally into the buyback effort. But early on, like I said, we put it in there at a rate of about $250 million on a full year basis and then ratchet it up as the year goes on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson, JPMC.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Thanks for taking the question. Just first one on H-Class, can you talk to utilization whether you've seen the consumable use really pick up as you've seen broader adoption in pharma. I think you mentioned CROs a little bit earlier. And then just talk to your overall attached rate with columns for H-Class, assuming it's closer to ACQUITY than it would be for Alliance, but if you could just give color that would be helpful.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Do you want to give some color that, Art?", "Arthur Caputo", "Sure. Yes, Tycho. The attached rate -- understand that the H-Class, unlike the original ACQUITY, was marketed to those remaining customers who are still committed or were having more difficult time to convert from LC to UPLC largely due to regulatory context and having to be revalidate and so forth. So the marketing of H-Class with that it was anticipated that we would sell UPLC capability to an HPLC user. That could use it for the 6 to 12 months in either a LC or a UPLC mode. And therefore, have that capability for the future, most HPLCs are purchased with the idea of running them from 5 to 7 years. And once you buy them, you're kind of stuck. So I'll say that the people who buy H-Class with the intention of utilizing it right out of the shoots [ph] for UPLC, the column utilization rates have maintained their consistency at plus 80%, meaning that we see that 80% of the time customer contingency is our own chemistry, which is radically up from our standard HPLC position of about 10%. For those who are starting off with the system to run LC, what we find is, once they do begin to use a system for UPLC, they do utilize our column chemistry at the same rate as one who had decided to do that initially. The columns they use on an HPLC side, that is the method that they were using. About half of our sales appeared to be going in and taking competitive positions. So it's not likely you would have our column in those situations. The other half are old users or people familiar with us and they have a higher majority where originally on our HPLC column consumables in the first place. So that's a rough idea of what's occurring with that product. It doesn't have the purity of use that the original UPLC had. Almost 100% of them were used right out of the shoot as a UPLC system. A little different than with H-Class because we wanted to continue to penetrate the market with that strategy.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then to the comment that you made before, Doug, about pharma and I appreciate additional color there. But we've heard over the years this concept of standardization as well to some degree standardizing QA/QC labs around ACQUITY. Are you seeing more of that from pharma as well essentially sole sourcing instruments from one vendor as they look to basically upgrade their facilities?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We've seen more standardization go into H-Class, Tycho, but you are still talking about some laboratories that have many instruments in there. And so we're not claiming that you're having a universal change out. But that momentum has certainly picked up in that direction.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay, and then just a last quick one on Japan, and appreciate your additional color there. Can you just comment on the supply chain side given that's a focus for people as well.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, we've seen no current significant issues on the supply side. We have completed an evaluation of our principal vendors and one level down to our most principal subcontractors in their supply chain. And I'd say, we don't see any current problems. I think that carries us probably out a quarter, maybe 2. And I think once you get out a couple of quarters, then the likelihood that the supply chain won't be able to deal with those issues gets reduced. So you can't say with absolutely certainty but it doesn't look like a real issue for us at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Lawson, Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Doug, just regarding the pharma CapEx spend. Could you perhaps tease that spend down versus CROs, generics, top 15? Any way you can read that?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "You mean in terms of how our growth occurred, Peter?", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Regarding your comment about the return of pharma CapEx. I just wondered where that was coming from whether it's CROs, whether it's the strength in generics or top 15 pharma?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We saw it across the board. Actually, a little bit surprising because -- a big pharma, the research pharmas are releasing their capital budgets later and later in the year it seems. And I think it's important to recognize, it wasn't really -- it's not like every research pharmaceutical had a banner quarter for us. But on balance, it was a very good quarter amongst those research pharmaceuticals. But it was certainly not limited to them. I mean, their results were very strong across the board of those broad-based pharmaceutical segments, CROs, generics and bio. So I think the encouraging sign is that maybe we saw research pharma will begin to spend their budgets a little earlier in the year than maybe we have seen in the past.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Thank you. And then just on the current balance between industrial and pharma end markets. Is there any way you can quantify the strength between those 2 end markets in the quarter?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, pharma grew faster than our average revenue growth in the quarter. So certainly pharma broadly described was the stronger part. The industrial markets, of course, a mix of industrial, chemical, environmental. In general, most of those subsegments were pretty good. So while not every single segment of our business performed at double-digit, it was pretty good across the board.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Marshall Urist, Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "I was wondering maybe if you could talk about Alliance versus UPLC mix in the quarter and kind of what you're seeing year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter and maybe the pockets of demand on both sides and kind of what residual you're seeing for Alliance? And then also, John, if you can just give us a little bit tease out gross margin in terms of the positives, negatives and just quantify that a little bit would be helpful.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure. Maybe I'll start and let the others chime in subsequently. I think the strongest Alliance markets for us are in Asia right now. That's still principally true in India, where the methods that they follow are largely the methods that were established elsewhere and they buy to ramp up their lab. We are seeing some switch to ACQUITY in those markets. But it's still predominantly an Alliance marketplace. I'd say that's still very true in certain segments in the China market where alliance is a very strong performer. In certain segments of the China market, ACQUITY is also penetrated. But those 2 markets are probably our strongest Alliance markets. And Art do you want to add anything to that?", "Arthur Caputo", "Yes. Well, probably the only thing when we first introduced the H-Class, we thought for sure, we're going to see a rapid drop off in conversion to H-Class over Alliance. And to our surprise, even with the high growth of H-Class because of the emerging markets as in Latin America -- into that equation. We find the emerging markets are -- they are beginning to convert now. But they're behind the Western markets in terms of converting from LC to UPLC. But for all intents and purposes, we have essentially maintained our Alliance growth rate at the rate quite comparable to our UPLC rates.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "And was that a margin...", "John Ornell", "Margin question?", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Yes.", "John Ornell", "Marshall, on the margins, the gross margin came in maybe a tick, less than what we might have expected originally and it is due to currency. We picked up about, \"a half a point or so\" improvement in the quarter associated with manufacturing cost reductions, volume leverage, which was offset by some currency, unfavorability from a year-over-year comparison perspective. The strengthening yen that we saw was less impactful this quarter as the Japanese sales were lower proportion of our overall mix of business. And then the U.K., the pound advanced about 3% across the quarter and that currency hit margins a tad too. But I'd say, generally, not that far off, but those are the components of the margin issue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just wanted to dig a little bit more into the HPLC business this quarter. I think you said the recurring revenue growth was about 7%. So is it fair to say that underlying market growth for the HPLC market is in that sort of high single-digit range? And then maybe if you could layer on top of that the components in your business this quarter that really drove the outperformance beyond just sort of H-Class adoption, and what I mean by that specifically is was there any real change in your view around market share and dynamics within some of the significant markets that were perhaps above long-term trend line for HPLC?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, we hesitate to and I think everybody should hesitate to take too much on market share dynamics based on one quarter's results. It's just very difficult to do that. And frankly, not all that meaningful. Clearly, when you're growing your instruments at 20%, anybody else who's doing that has to be having a good time also. So we don't think that this market would never contented that it's got secular growth rates of north of 20%. So we think we're doing pretty well. Clearly, our chemistry business and our service parts and spare parts, not, and never will grow north of high single digits or something around 10%. But with our hardware and systems business growing as fast as it is, we feel pretty good about pacing the industry right now. I also say, though, I think it's -- the laboratory and the analytical market feels pretty good. So wouldn't surprise me if others servicing this marketplace are also producing pretty good results.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. If I can just ask a quick follow-up on that dynamic. I mean, as we look to the middle part of the year, how do you feel about your visibility on that continued hardware growth being in that -- it seems the 20% growth rate. Do you see any reason to expect the change aside from the end markets dynamics in Japan that you mentioned?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I think it's fair to say if you look closely the numbers that John described for the second quarter and the rest of the year that we're not going to count on that level of year-over-year strength going out. It was a stronger quarter than we had originally budgeted for or originally forecast. I can't tell you that right now, we're seeing market conditions that have deteriorated from that. But I think it would be dangerous for us to take that kind of performance to the bank for the rest of the year. So while we've increased our expectations, we think that it would be prudent to keep them within a range that offers us -- clearly offer some opportunity that the market could perform better. But we think it's well within our range of opportunity to perform against.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jon Groberg, Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Just a couple of clarification questions, I guess. Appreciate, Doug, the color on the Asia and Japan growth. Can you maybe just remind us that business growing close to 30% organically kind of the mix, the margin mix impact that Asia has on the business? And my second, just kind of clarification question, John, if you could again just kind of rundown kind of what you're balance sheet currently stands at from a debt perspective. I think you had some debt that moved into from long term to short term, and I think you said, you raised some debt. So just maybe give us kind of the latest -- current up-to-date view of the balance sheet.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, John, if I get your question properly, the Asia business margin dynamic certainly the operating margin dynamics are at or above the average for the company. So it's a very profitable business. The gross margins may be a tick below average margins, but not tremendously different. But on balance, I'd say, if you model Asia for a little bit slower gross margins and a little bit higher operating margins, you'd have the right picture for Asia. Does that answer that question?", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Yes. Perfect. Thanks.", "John Ornell", "And then on the balance sheet, Jon, what we've done is we have a revolving credit agreement with a consortium of banks that expires at the start of 2012. So what you've seen is you've seen a movement on the balance sheet from long-term into short-term debt associated with that debt. So we have efforts in place to begin the process of re-upping that credit agreement. We're looking to create another 5-year agreement that will be in place second half of this year. In the interim, to be able to diversify away from having just a bank debt, we've moved into the private placement market. Last year, we made our first foray into that market with a couple hundred million dollars of refinancings and we added to that in the first quarter with another $200 million of debt refinancing as well. And we decided to do fixed debt for this $400 million portion of the portfolio. And we'll likely, re-do the credit agreement with the banks as we make our way through this year on a variable rate basis. So that's the current thinking on the balance sheet and the debt structure.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Thanks a lot, that was helpful. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Paul Knight, CLSA.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "When you look at emerging markets, do you have any concerns that year-over-year comps on large contracts are out there or is it a right number of contracts that, that's not going to be an issue now or in the foreseeable future?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think it's fair to say that in recent years, we have seen an increased volume of somewhat larger tenders in the emerging markets, emerging markets being the BRIC side [ph] -- would be specifically what we're talking about. But our forecasts take into account the kind of flow that we've seen in those large tender areas. And we think that despite the fact that last year was a very successfully year with some large contracts, we don't anticipate a great deal of difficulty in those territories achieving the kind of result that we've outlined for you. So the markets continued to be strong. And the opportunities that we are working continue to be very encouraging.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Dan Leonard, Leerink Swann.", "Daniel Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC", "Any indications from your customers that the recent 2 legislations that you won might spur additional demand?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, could you repeat that? We got cut off here.", "Daniel Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC", "Sure. Any indication from your customers on the food safety front that recent legislation could spur an increase in demand?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "We think, long term, there's no question that it's going to spur demand. What the pace of that will be I think remains to be seen. I think people are still kind of figuring out what their strategic reaction will be in terms of inside the U.S. A large agri-producers and importers probably have somewhat better position. Lots of questions as to how it's going to affect the mid-sized and the smaller affected organization. So I would say, we haven't seen a lot of business coming out of that yet. Our belief is that, it will impact our business outside the U.S. probably faster as exporters gear up a little bit more to meet the expected requirements. And probably as we move into 2012, you'll see more investment in the United States. We think we're in excellent strategic position, given our position with the FDA, the USDA, our standardized laboratory support in Maryland and emerging activities in China, in particular, position us very well to be at the forefront of these activities.", "Daniel Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin, UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "So if the replacement cycle that you're seeing in the pharma continues, I guess, can you just remind us what your split is between your research installed base at pharma and in the UPLC/HPLC market and the manufacturing install base. I guess what I'm trying to get after is -- I mean, assume that most of the research market has already kind of moved to ACQUITY. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much juice is left in kind of moving over the manufacturing QA/QC base? Like how many more years would you think it would take to fully share on that base?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure. I will let Art give you the actual numbers. But in any one quarter, clearly, we could have a much stronger research segment of our business versus QA, QC. So it can switch around. Clearly, the install base doesn't switch around that -- I mean that is a much more standard. Art, you want to answer it however you please?", "Arthur Caputo", "I mean, it's safe to say that we have run roughly half researched to development, half development to the QC segment. So our business tends to settle in those types of ratios. I would also say that probably the biggest change that we're seeing particularly in big pharma is that, HPLC utilization and replacement can be a tricky thing. Some will see a new instrument, and will replace it couple of years earlier than the typical 7, some will stretch it out. The dynamic that we're seeing with UPLC is that we're going in and showing these customers irrespective of where that product is in its depreciation cycle. How they can improve the productivity in their operation. That goes beyond the instrument that personnel ", "[Technical Difficulty] ", "A slight difference from the traditional replacement where we deal with. I'm sorry, you had a comment?", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "I'm sorry. You faded out on some of the question, on some of your answer there. I guess as a follow-up on that, do you plan to basically obsolete the Alliance at some point in time to basically force everybody to the H-Class? I mean, at some point in time, are you telling your customers, you better switchover now because you're not going to support Alliance? I guess, what's your plan?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "No, we haven't. And we have no active plan to obsolete the Alliance. Of course, a lot depends on how the market evolves. Right now, there's certain segments of the market that are saying they really value the Alliance configuration and want to stick with it. Certainly, it is possible that over the next 5 years or so, it will move in that direction.", "Arthur Caputo", "There is a critical component to this industry and with a large portion of our product line being sold and has been sold into the pharmaceutical regulated environment. There's a lot of assays. Every patent for every drug has HPLC data on it. It is used extensively from one end of the spectrum to the other once it comes off patent it moves into generics. Keep in mind that the cost of converting in many cases for very basic analysis of a drug is way too high for a company to implement that. So if they're using an Alliance system with a standard separation. And it's not a critical analysis that could have huge benefits from moving to UPLC. Those stay with Alliance and that life cycle could be quite long. We are the first product of the 70s, that would be [indiscernible]. Those sales are still going strong. There are a lot better columns out there but they're just not going to change those methods. So unlike some industries where you see conversion of products, it is likely HPLC will be around for a lot of these older methods for a long time to come. And to be frank, with the momentum coming out of India, China, and Latin America with a lot of the generics, there's simply adopting the original methods. And it's cost-effective for them to do that. They're not complex separations. HPLC works fine for those applications.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "It's still likely that the Alliance mix will continue to go down. I think that's very clear. But it's still both strong product lines. I noticed it's 9:30. We're willing to stay on for a little bit longer. I realized that some of you probably have to get off. But we'll try to answer the people who are in the queue if there is still there, operator.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sung Ji Nam, Gleacher & Company.", "Sung Ji Nam - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Thanks for taking the questions. Going back to Derik's product replacement cycle. With H-Class, do you anticipate the product lifecycle to be shorter than for the legacy UPLC, given heavier utilization?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, for several people it's getting harder to hear. I think you may be on speakerphones and it's a -- could you repeat that question?", "Sung Ji Nam - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "I just wanted to ask about -- going back to the product replacement cycles for H-Class. Do you anticipate the product life cycle to be shorter compared to UPLC, given heavier utilization for H-Class?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "No, I don't think we anticipate life cycles to be materially shorter.", "Arthur Caputo", "No. We find most of the pharmaceutical companies are running their instruments, as I said, 5 to 7 years, sometimes a little longer. The methods that are being developed are going to be subjected to the same life cycles for their products as it's always been the case. So we have no indication that there will be any shift in those life cycles and people anticipate that they'll maintain the same type of use and depreciation.", "Sung Ji Nam - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks and just a quick question, what's the size of your emerging market or developing market business today?", "Arthur Caputo", "Yes, We'd say that Asia, Eastern Europe, some of the Latin American countries, all in sum total probably about a quarter of our business.", "Sung Ji Nam - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Tony Butler, Barclays Capital.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Just a brief housekeeping question and then one follow-up. You've commented that the growth of expenses would be below the organic revenue growth and you've given guidance for 10% organic revenue growth. So the question comes, can you provide some relative scenarios to what would happen for the incremental margin opportunity, if revenues are, say, a little bit better than expected or in fact a little bit worst. Appreciate the color there.", "Arthur Caputo", "Yes, I'd say, if we think about what's changing here year-over-year, I mean, we're certainly putting some incremental headcounts in place in the developing parts of the business. We are beginning to spend a bit more on the discretionary side for promotional activities in the like as we have a number of new products making their way to market. The expectation would be that we would have a point, maybe a couple of points of differential on a full year basis and the growth rate of our expenses versus the top line [indiscernible] on and organic basis. In the second quarter, where we have 5 points of currency on the top line, we're going to have a similar dynamic of growth on the SG&A line. So foreign exchange is going to make a difference in the reported growth. It will give keep up with the top line but the differential will still be there. So I would say, we have flexibility certainly to the extent that the organic growth is greater than what we say. We're not likely to instantly react to that with incremental headcount adds. There will be commissions and variable pay plans that will take a little bit of a bite perhaps out of that but not anything all that meaningful. And then certainly on the downside to the extent that there is an action there we need to deal with, I mean, go back on the discretionary spending. The variable pay programs have come down comparably to the top line. So there's a little bit of flexibility I'd say on the downside as well. But based on what we see right now, I'd say, we're pretty comfortable with the top line number that we have.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Thanks, John. And last question, the biopharma targeted ACQUITY plus the Xevo TOF [time-of-flight] system having the UNIFI software was interesting. I assume that LC/MS system collectively is for QC applications. But I'm also curious if in fact, this has been developed based on customer demand. And if so, we just had had the impression that the MS detector today might actually be too expensive for QC, is that incorrect or would costs come down? Or any color there would be helpful.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "If you think about traditional pharma, the research ethical type companies, you are probably right, unless the application clearly demanded the use of mass spectrometry. You would not likely find that in the quality control lab [ph]. That biopharmaceutical system would be ACQUITY and the mass spectrometer attached is really targeted at the biopharmaceutical segment where you have a lot of high-value added processes taking place. And therefore, you are more likely, not in all cases, but you're more likely to see test systems that do in fact incorporate mass spectrometry that it's fairly sophisticated separations largely because of the nature of the more complicated biopharmaceutical samples, peptides and so forth. So that's a very focused segment we are going after. And so far, the acceptance is quite well. And it was for probably the last 5 years we have spent incredible amount of time bringing focus groups together specifically from the biopharmaceutical industry and trying to find out, what is it that you need to help your process. And it's a very different discussion than you're going to find in the small molecule research-grade ethical houses. So that's a very targeted system, and we think over time, that represents an increasing share of the activity in the analytical space in certain markets.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Thank you, all.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Bill Bonello, RBC.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Hey, thanks a lot for hanging in for my question. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, just some exciting things happening at ASMS later this summer. I'm just curious if you can give any more of a preview beyond that and what kinds of things we might be looking for?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Art, will come across at the desk at me if I do that, Bill. So I'm going to turn it to him, so then he can only blame himself for letting the cat out of the bag.", "Arthur Caputo", "So I won't get really specific largely because, as usual, these things are unveiled. But what you can expect to see from us from ASMS this year, we're very focused on continuing enhancement of speed, sensitivity and resolution. Those are the three elements that the people who go to ASMS, show up for one reason and one reason only. The kind of compounds they're working with. They\u2019re looking for the vendors to give them a major improvement in speed, sensitivity and the resolution for the types of compounds that they're working on. So as we look at ASMS this year, both for mass spectrometry as well as UPLC, we're going to be bringing out major improvements in both of those technologies, not only individual capabilities in those specific technologies, but you'll see us beginning to focus on targeted applications using our system strategy. So we'll look at some areas of what we believe will be high activity where we can offer a new system solution that can really offer these customers orders of magnitude in terms of the kind of results that we're getting. So that's the type of direction that we're taking at this year's ASMS. You will see about 2 to 3 major systems offerings targeted in that area.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "You're welcome, Bill. And thank you all for sticking with us this long. It's been a good start to the year. And we hope to talk to you with similar results as we go through the year.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call as usual is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. And as our normal practice, I'll start with an overview of the quarter's highlights, and then John will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the third quarter and for the full year. Before we get going, however, I'd like John to cover the usual cautionary language.", "John Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for Q3 and full year 2011. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.", "For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, in Part I under the caption Business Risk Factors. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.", "The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2011. ", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share included in this morning's press release.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well, our sales in the quarter grew 14%, and our adjusted earnings were up about 16%. This growth in revenue and earnings, although a little lighter than we had anticipated, was driven by an order volume that was higher than reported sales. Highlights of the quarter include significant new product launches at the ASMS Conference, strong recurring revenue growth and continued double-digit Asian sales growth. The stronger orders that I referred to and the accompanying backlog build were significantly associated with bookings for newly introduced products with third quarter shipping terms. ", "In the United States, sales to combined government and academic institutions were soft in the second quarter, and orders from pharmaceutical customers slowed as we approached the quarter's close. On the other hand, our chemical analysis business continued with good momentum. ", "Globally, Waters Division sales to the pharmaceutical end market were in line with the division's overall growth rate, with particular strength observed in Western Europe, Latin America and India. Applications within pharma that are driving growth include Regulated Bioanalysis, biological pharmaceutical development and QC testing. Here, I'm referring to protein and peptide-based therapeutics. ACQUITY H-Class uptake remained strong in QC application. Sales in our largest accounts grew sequentially from a strong first quarter performance and also in comparison to the prior year's quarterly result. ", "Global government and university spending was soft for the Waters Division and moderately impacted overall sales growth. The major exceptions to this trend were China and Latin America where we saw double-digit sales increases. Though we are not overly optimistic about worldwide governmental support for research for the foreseeable future, we do feel that our innovative new systems, especially in high-end mass spectrometry, will allow us to compete favorably within this more challenging funding environment. ", "Sales to industrial chemical accounts varied somewhat by geography with stronger growth in developing countries than what we saw in Western Europe and the U.S. Our TA Instruments Division's strong performance corroborates continued underlying strength in industrial spending. ", "If you look at TA, the division delivered yet another double-digit sales growth quarter. Sales growth for TA was geographically balanced and included revenues associated with shipment of the new discovery DSC instrument. This new -- this system is the launch of a new instrument platform configuration that will embody the majority of TA's future performance-leading thermal offerings. Also interesting to note is that earlier this month, we closed a smaller-sized acquisition that secures technology, which will allow TA to pursue higher-temperature thermal analysis measurements critical to the characterization of materials such as ceramics and metals. ", "Sales for our applied markets dominated by food and environmental applications grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. In Japan, our business has rebounded nicely in light of the circumstances endured there during the first part of the year. The drivers of growth in Japan were a pickup in our service business and strong sales of LC/MS systems for chemical analysis applications. ", "Constant currency sales growth in Europe for the Waters Division was consistent with the company's overall performance, with stronger pharmaceutical results driving Western European growth and chemical analysis segments performing well in Eastern Europe. In the second half of 2011, we anticipate that pharmaceutical spending, primarily in larger Western European countries, and continued strength in Eastern Europe will continue to drive growth. In light of all the concerns around macroeconomic issues in Europe, we are pleased that our business has maintained positive momentum and that we in fact built backlog associated with new product introductions that we plan to ship in the third quarter. ", "In Asia x Japan, sales were in line with our expectations with China continuing as the growth engine with significant year-over-year acceleration in university spending and very robust chemical analysis growth. Our second half outlook for Asia x Japan is for a continuation of the strong performance delivered year-to-date. ", "Now I'll discuss some product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. And afterwards, I'll briefly review our ASMS new system launches. ", "Our recurring revenue, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, posted strong results in the quarter, growing close to 10% in constant currency. The growth in chromatography consumables was primarily driven by ACQUITY column sales in our more mature markets and by overall strong column sales in developing markets, most notably China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Similarly, our service business benefited from faster growth in the same developing markets. ", "Looking at our Waters Division instrument system sales, growth was comparable for LC and LC/MS instruments. On the chromatography front, UPLC systems grew at a double-digit rate with H-Class now dominating ACQUITY sales. And our new ACQUITY I-Class will start shipping in the third quarter. ", "LC/MS system growth was primarily driven by tandem quadrupole placements in the quarter with our high-sensitivity Xevo TQ-S, capturing more bioanalytical opportunities, and our workhorse TQD base systems more heavily devoted to food, environmental and clinical new instrument sales. ", "SYNAPT MS demand slowed in the quarter, especially in comparison to strong academic shipments in the 2010 quarter and in anticipation of the new SYNAPT G2-S that we introduced at ASMS in early June. At ASMS, we showcased 3 significant new instrument system launches: the aforementioned SYNAPT G2-S in both MS and HDMS configurations; a system for Regulated Bioanalysis, incorporating a new ACQUITY I-Class front end; and a replacement for our successful TQD workhorse tandem quadrupole that we have named the XEVO TQD. I encourage you all to go to our website for more detailed information about each of these new systems, and I'm pleased to tell you that we plan customer shipments for all of these systems in the third quarter. ", "A significant launch for us at ASMS was a new application-focused instrument system for Regulated Bioanalysis. Our Regulated Bioanalysis System integrates a new ACQUITY I-Class UPLC with our Xevo TQ-S mass spectrometer, all operating with a tailored version of our new unified operating system. This system is the result of an exhaustive effort to thoroughly understand the workflow of scientists working in drug development and to layer on to this workflow the most advanced technologies to prepare samples, effect superior separation and detection and to finally amass all this critical information in a secure and easy-to-navigate information management system. ", "We believe that our new Regulated Bioanalysis System does this and more by not only addressing the current needs of the market but anticipating future requirements, especially in the areas of data integrity and advanced separation chemistries for biologically sensitized drugs. Combining these new systems with the business momentum that we are enjoying with our ACQUITY H-Class sales, I think Waters is in an advantageous position. ", "However, that is not stopping us from pursuing an aggressive new product introduction plan that you will see us execute over the next several quarters. We have a strong new product pipeline and remain committed to maintaining our position as an industry leader. ", "So how are we to look at the remainder of 2011 and beyond? Well, I remain positive on our outlook for the second half of 2011. After a somewhat muted finish to the second quarter, especially in the U.S., and ahead of the July 4 holiday, the third quarter has started off well, and I'm encouraged by the customer reception to our newly introduced systems. I also feel that the major business benefits of our new system launches will be most apparent as the year progresses and should allow us to continue to show nice top line growth despite a more challenging base of comparison. In all I feel that the full year growth outlook that I shared with you in April remains intact and that 2011 should prove to be another year of market-leading growth and profitability for Waters. So at this time, I'd like to turn it over to John for a more detailed financial review.", "John Ornell", "Thank you, Doug. And good morning. Second quarter sales increased by 14%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 16% at $1.08 this quarter compared to $0.93 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.07 this quarter versus $0.90 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning. ", "Reviewing Q2 sales results in comparison to Q2 last year. Sales were up 14%. This growth includes 6 points of growth from foreign currency translation. ", "Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects. Sales in the U.S. were up 2%, Europe sales were up 6%, Japan was up 11% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14%. ", "On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters Division, instrument system sales increased by 6%, and recurring revenues grew by 9% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 10% versus prior year. ", "Now I would like to comment on our Q2 non-GAAP reported financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in at 60.7%, up 40 basis points from Q2 last year. This quarter, we saw positive effects on margins from manufacturing cost reductions, volume leverage and favorable currency comparison. SG&A expenses increased by 17% this quarter, with currency translation responsible for about 6.5 points of this increase. We had expected SG&A to grow more quickly earlier in the year due to difficult comparisons, and this quarter's growth was additionally impacted by stronger foreign exchange effects than projected and higher costs associated with new product launches. Looking forward, we expect SG&A to grow about -- with sales in the third quarter and slower than sales in the fourth quarter. ", "R&D expenses increased by 11% this quarter with currency translation responsible for 3 points of this growth. Our full year effective operating income tax rate came in a little better than expected at 16.2%. ", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.1 billion, and debt totaled $836 million, bringing us to a net cash position of about $285 million. As for share repurchases, we bought 845,000 shares of our common stock for $81 million. This leaves $403 million to go on the current authorized share repurchase program. ", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. ", "For Q2, free cash flow came in on target at $88 million after funding $19 million of CapEx, netting back $9 million of noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Through the half, free cash flow is $199 million versus $197 million last year. ", "Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 74 days this quarter, up one day from Q2 last year. Currency effects increased DSO 2 days this quarter versus prior year. ", "Inventories were up $18 million this quarter. Currency translation accounts for about $3 million of this increase. We expect inventories to decline as we approach the end of the year as product build associated with new products is relieved. ", "Overall, our second quarter's performance was slightly less than we anticipated on both the top line and bottom line as we experienced a slowing of business in the U.S. late in the quarter. Since then, demand in the U.S. has rebounded, and we now believe that these events were largely temporary and related to ordering delays associated with new product introductions at ASMS and the 4th of July holiday. ", "As we begin third quarter with a larger than anticipated backlog providing additional confidence early in the quarter. The softness we saw in the government academic markets, we believe, will be tempered by growing interest in our new mass spec products, and that even in a more difficult funding environment, we will see some improvement here in the second half versus our Q2 results. ", "As we think about the remainder of 2011, we continue to see relevant stability in our end markets and continued momentum in the acceptance of our new products. We continue to expect to see around a 10% growth in sales for full year 2011 before currency translation. And at today's rates, currency is likely to add 3 points to reported sales growth. ", "Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the full year are expected to be between 60.5% and 61% as we continue to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and volume leverage, offsetting margin pressure from new product introductions. Currency at today's levels looks to be slightly favorable to margins in the second half of the year. Operating expenses are expected to grow about equal to sales in the third quarter and at a slower rate than sales in the fourth quarter. ", "Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $17 million, and we now expect an operating tax rate to be about 16%. Our fully diluted average outstanding share count is likely to decrease by 1.5 million shares in 2011. Rolling all of this together, we currently -- we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90. ", "For Q3, we expect organic sales growth of about 9%. Currency translation at today's levels is expected to add about 4% to sales growth this quarter, bringing reported revenue growth to about 13%. Gross margins percentage is expected to be comparable to Q2, and operating expenses are expected to grow about equal to sales. And we plan to proceed on our share repurchase program under the authorized $500 million program. All of this is expected to result in a third quarter non-GAAP EPS of between $1.10 and $1.15 per fully diluted share. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Operator, at this point, I think we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Daniel Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC", "Just one quick one and a follow-up. The delta versus expectations in the quarter. I understand the weakness in U.S. academia, but I guess why would July 4 have played a particular surprising role versus expectations?", "John Ornell", "Yes, we saw in the U.S. much less of a hockey stick in the last week of the quarter. The business was off pretty significantly as we advanced in week 13, and we saw a lot of that business actually come back early in Q3. So we were a little surprised to see the softening as that week went on. I think for a lot of people, maybe Wednesday, the 30th, was the end of their fiscal quarter, and we saw much less business than is normal in the closing of the week, Thursday and Friday. As we look at the first few weeks in the U.S., again Q3, we saw a lot of that business come right through and so a lot of the orders that we were chasing at the end of the second quarter have been booked and shipped as we speak. So it appears that the strength in the U.S. is kind of back to what we would have expected early in the quarter, and it appears to us to be merely a delay and not anything more than that at this stage.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "But Dan, just to be sure, that's kind of one factor. We were expecting to be able to close more business. ASMS was more significant on the high-end mass spec side. We think that kind of delayed some existing product orders. That also seems to be a hypothesis that's playing out in what we're seeing early on in the third quarter. So yes, we did see that weakness. We're doing our best to understand it. And of course, when you hear the sales management and the sales force say, \"Gee, I expected to get that order,\" \"I expected to be able to ship it, but it didn't,\" well, the fact that it did come in the first week in July and then shipped first week in August, excuse me...", "John Ornell", "In July.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "No, first week of July. Yes, I'll get there. It adds credibility to that. That's all I think John is saying.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "So it seems like, to Dan's point, the bigger delta was on sort of the Waters instrument line. If you had to sort of tease out kind of timing effect based on new product launches, some of the weakness you saw specifically in the U.S., kind of mass spec versus LC, I'm just trying to get a bit more color in terms of the components of how you would attribute the delta between whatever the internal forecast was and sort of what was reported on an instrument basis since that's where it seems to be kind of the major focus point.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think that as we look at the areas where we saw the softness develop, I would say that as we look at the government academic piece, that appears to be much more heavily weighted towards the timing of the new product launches. There's a fair amount of interest in that segment, in the new, as you talked, G2-S. We believe that as that product begins to make its way to demo labs and then ramps up production across the quarter, that we're likely to see some relief with the shipments to that customer base. There\u2019s some words booked already for that instrument and a lot of interest, and it is no doubt that it had slowed, the order ramp post-ASMS, as we began to promote that instrument. Now we knew some of that was going to happen, and we did anticipate that a backlog build would develop from that. But the backlog build was much larger associated with that instrument than we had estimated. On the LC side, I would say that there were just a significant number of pharma accounts in the U.S. that just tailed off business in -- late in the quarter. And that's the business that's already come in and shipped early in the third quarter. So we've seen -- we saw a decline in our pharma business in the U.S. from about 8% or thereabouts in the first quarter to about 4% growth in the second quarter, and that seems to have turned right back around and come back to us early in Q3. So that's a little bit more color on what we've seen in those couple of markets.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "And maybe just to sort of dig in a bit more, I mean, obviously, from a macro basis, there was kind of a deterioration in confidence sort of in the time period. You highlighted where you started to see some weakness at the beginning part of July, end of June just based on all that was going on in Europe and in the U.S. on the debt side. If you start to think about the trends you've seen so far in 3Q, obviously you said it's improved. How well do you think -- if you think about the typical pacing of your -- of a normal Q3, how well do you think that sort of characterizes kind of the rest of the trend for the quarter in the context that: Are the first few weeks of Q3 important? Are the last 3 weeks -- I'm just trying to get a sense for how Q3 differs versus other quarters in terms of typical pacing, and how much confidence we should take in sort of the early trend to read through the whole quarter.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I think your question's a good one because 3 weeks do not a quarter make. We're encouraged because it specifically points to the issues that we saw kind of in the latter part of the second quarter in the U.S. And so we're specifically seeing unusual early strength in that segment of our business coming as we speak. So it's not like a surge in Chinese Waters is offsetting weakness in the U.S. It kind of adds a clear level of confidence that what the field was telling us was happening in the latter part of the second quarter seems to be playing out as they were confident that those orders were coming in. And they're coming in at a growth level that's over and above what you'd expect out of a normal beginning to the quarter. So that is clearly encouraging to us. We're still -- we're not taking that current run rate of our business and straight lining it for the quarter. Frankly, if we did, our growth rate would be much higher. But what it certainly does is give us a level of confidence that our outlook has a degree of credibility to us that's warranted given the current start to the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "So you guys maintained full year guidance. You talked about some of the Q2 business shifting into Q3. However, it looks like your expectations for the second half were actually more backloaded than what the Street was expecting. Specifically, it looks like you guided Q3 maybe below where the Street was on an organic basis. Or certainly, it doesn't look like it was any better than where the Street was, again in spite of the fact that some of those Q2 sales seem to move into Q3. Were we just too aggressive with our Q3 expectations? Or is there some reason now that you're now thinking that sales are going to be more backloaded than certainly what we were expecting previously?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I would say that as we look at the ramp-up of the new products, we expect to begin to ship the new G2-S starting in early September. We'll be ramping that up across the third month of the quarter and certainly ramping it through all of Q4 to meet the demand that we expect for that product. So the fact that we're early on in preproduction, moving to production in these products gives us a level of confidence that a 9% growth this quarter, certainly coming into the quarter with a meaningful backlog, makes sense to us. But we think that really, the real benefit of these new products is really going to be seen in the fourth quarter. So there is a little bit of a shift, if you will, associated with these products into the fourth quarter. Additionally, we've got a little bit better currency environment. So that plays a little bit of a factor in the fourth quarter as well as the third quarter, and it's currency that's kind of offsetting the delta in the second quarter to keep that full year guidance intact.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. And one quick follow-up. Any chance you would provide a little bit more detail on how much higher book-to-bill was this quarter than the last few quarters given that you did call that out as a sign that the business was still strong and improving net against...", "Douglas Berthiaume", "One level of flavor is that our backlog builds -- with significant lag terms, and it was substantially higher than it is traditionally in the second quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Maybe just to follow up a little bit on the last one, Doug or John. Given the shortfall in the second quarter and the outlook for the third quarter, why maintain guidance here? I guess it looks pretty aggressive at this point. And just given the fact that, as you just witnessed in the second quarter, you don't always have the best visibility in terms of what's going to happen. I mean, do you have any thoughts as to maybe tempering guidance a little bit and then seeing if things play out better than you expect?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, Jon, we\u2019ve gone through many, many years of this, we've tried through all of our inputs to draw a pretty mid-line between a conservative outlook, a liberal outlook and a mainline outlook of what we see. We certainly saw a slower close to the second quarter than we anticipated, and that would have tempered our outlook somewhat for the coming year. But when we roll up all the factors, we look at the new product launches, we look at the backlog position, we look at our current run rate of our business, we look at the field inputs and we draw that middle line, we say, \"We don't want to yo-yo people, we don't want to yo-yo our own organization into allowing spending to creep up a little bit and then to haul it back.\" So we think we're -- we've got a forecast for the rest of the year and guidance here at the same level of credibility that we would normally have. It doesn't make it a dead solid cinch, but neither does it make it an extraordinary amount of risk that goes into it. We think we're drawing that same middle line with an opportunity. You've seen us in previous quarters exceed our guidance. And somebody might have said, \"Well, you're seeing that.\" Well, we don't think we're seeing that. We think we kind of have the opportunity to exceed these numbers. And there's some risk, as we saw this last quarter, that we might underachieve them, but we haven't changed our practice. I guess that's my -- and yes, you could say arbitrarily take it down by some arbitrary number, but we know that's not our policy and it's not our practice. So we haven't done it.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay, fair enough. If I could just follow up then. You mentioned pharma got weak, I think, in the U.S. in the second quarter, but it seems that, that was one that seems to have rebounded. I guess where do you currently sit in terms of your comfort level with replacement market brewing in the QA/QC market for pharma and kind of the timing of that?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I just, as John said -- the specific area where we saw the most softness was in the U.S. And that's the specific area where we've seen the most rebound coming in our current results in the third quarter. So I think that's an encouraging dynamic. We had a pretty good first quarter in the U.S. We anticipated that to continue. It was less robust than we thought.", "John Ornell", "And the H-Class actually did pretty well in the quarter in spite of the overall results. The original ACQUITY saw some meaningful softness and some shift to the I-Class. We did obviously see some reduction in the growth in both H-Class and Alliance, but those 2 have come right back around, as Doug said, as we get to the third quarter. The I-Class will begin shipping late August, and we expect to see growth in the research grade side of the LC market once we put that I-Class into position in the second half of the quarter.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "And Doug, I wonder if you could just parse out the slowing growth you saw in pharma, how -- whether it's large, small, generic, CROs? And kind of which businesses bounced back?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, Pete, I missed half of that question. Can you repeat that?", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "It's just regarding the slowing growth in Pharma and could you parse that out? I know you have large, small, generic CROs kind of parsed into the same group. I wonder if you could break that out.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, I think we saw, particularly in the U.S., that slowing would be most dominated by the large accounts. So that's where -- and that's typically where we have pretty good visibility. And that's also where we've seen a number of those orders come in early in the third quarter. So I would say it's mainly a large account dynamic. That doesn't necessarily mean ethical. We now have some very large bio and generic accounts. But I'd say the weakness that we saw was in the large accounts.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "And then the strength in the TA business. What's the outlook there? And is that predominantly driven by Asia?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Probably our highest growth within the developing world, including Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. But TA's remarkably consistent across geographies. And I would say it'll be interesting as the new DSC really gets rolling, and we've really just started rolling that out. You'd expect that to get the most play in your most sophisticated accounts, and that would have an impact in the U.S. and in Western Europe. So I'm optimistic that TA could even surprise us a little, although Terry Kelly would deny that to me. But I think they've got a good roll on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla of Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "I want to know if you could just expand a little bit about on the industrial end markets. You talked about some softness in U.S. and Europe. So could you get into a little more detail there?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, John, you want to start with that?", "John Ornell", "Sure, yes. I would say the traditional chemical industry accounts, were the area where the softness -- or the large producers that we all know had a somewhat softer quarter in Q2 versus prior year. Where we saw strength continued to be in the applied markets, so we -- the food safety, the environmental, beverage, we continued to see an uptake of our instrument systems there. Our triple quadrupole placements were actually pretty good in those areas. So that's somewhat a continuation of a trend that we saw coming into the quarter and not really too much of a surprise. It's really the applied markets that have been driving growth, and that's continuing as we speak.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "And how much of the food safety component is coming from new legislation versus just traditional growth in that market?", "John Ornell", "I don't think we're seeing a lot of dynamic from new legislation. But most of it's coming from applications and accounts that we've identified in our traditional line. And the impact of that legislation is still yet to be seen.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And just quickly on the academic government side in the U.S. Your outlook is for that to be just continued weakness, but you have new products coming in to help your business growth. But overall outlook will be weak for the market. Is that fair?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, I think we're expecting that the market dynamic is going to be flattish. We think that we have the opportunity to do better with the new products because we saw weakness in kind of the cutting edge proteomics and life science research. Those applications tend to be higher on the priority list for spending. And with -- and we know we saw some delays in the -- as a result of the G2-S introduction that go into those applications. But we're still reluctant to bank too much on that whole market because the uncertainty of funding. So that doesn\u2019t factor significantly into our expectations for growth for the second half.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Sorry to dial in on the pharma dynamic again. But just to be clear, was the slowdown -- and obviously, things have picked up this quarter, but was the slowdown there a function of pharma evaluating some of the new product cycles? Or was there something more to it? And can you just talk along those lines about how you're thinking about I-Class going into pharma discovery when you launch in the third quarter?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, I wish I could be very definitive about it, Tycho. We saw good performance there in the first quarter, and then it slowed a bit in the second quarter. H-Class continues to do well, although it grew at a slower rate than in the first quarter. We clearly saw on some of the higher-end research applications customers wanting to wait because the I-Class that we introduced clearly has kind of eye-popping performance. And so in those front-end research applications where performance is kind of controlled, I think we clearly saw a delay in ACQUITY orders because of the introduction of the I-Class, and we won't be shipping that until the third quarter. So that's something we can specifically point to. And other than that, traditionally I'd say we see the big pharma accounts delaying their capital spend at the front end of the year. And sometimes, they delay it right up until the fourth quarter. That doesn't mean they don\u2019t spend anything, but they hold back significant pieces of those capital budgets. We thought, with the first quarter performance, that we saw a difference there. And yet in the second quarter, we saw some reluctance to spend in those large accounts. Now I'll tell you, we have looked exhaustively at competitive dynamics. And in an account -- do we lose share in specific accounts? I can tell you unequivocally that we don't think that, that dynamic is occurring. Clearly, we don't have 100% of the market. And clearly, we lose some bids and win others. But as a broad characterization, this was not a competitive dynamic that we saw in the second quarter. And we -- again we see some signs that it could well have been temporary. Now whether that was because these accounts worried about macroeconomics or they worried about regulation, it's hard to tell. But we do see some signs that it's not continuing into the third quarter.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And how are you thinking about your own level of spending? I mean, you've always talked about that's going to be somewhat dependent on top line growth. And understanding you're not changing guidance for the year, but are you holding back a little bit on spending in the near term? Or how are you thinking about that having an impact.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think we're being careful. I think -- again, it's important to recognize that in 2010, we were pretty conservative with our spending plan through the first half of the year. And then you can see that as our volume increased, we increased our SG&A spending as the year went along. So we had tough compares in the first half of 2011 versus that tighter spending situation in the first half of 2010. As we go through this year, those comparisons clearly get easier. But in the second quarter, we did spend more given the robustness of that new product position, particularly on the G2-S and the new I-Class. So we're not going to have to repeat that as we go through the year. I think the second quarter was a little bit of an anomaly as you look at our SG&A spend. John, would you agree with that?", "John Ornell", "No, I would agree. And I would say certainly, by the time you get to the fourth quarter, we're going to have a very favorable comparison. And you're going to see the SG&A growth come down dramatically. In the third quarter, there\u2019s still a little bit of a difficult comparison and SG&A is likely to be a little less than sales. In the second quarter, we had the ASMS rollout, we had a number of costs associated with that, including the large number of people that we sent to the show given the -- a large user meeting, and the lag that was there. So there's no doubt that the spend will decline on those types of activities as we make our way through the back half of the year, and you'll see SG&A become more rational as we exit the year.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then geographically, I mean, it looks like Europe was okay, up about 6%. We've seen some other data points in the space that suggest that Europe has gotten a little bit softer. Have you seen anything thus far in the third quarter that indicates a change in sentiment in Europe?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "No. I'd say particularly, the area of Europe that I've been -- had a higher level of concern with is Western Europe. The traditional -- and historically, where I've been more worried is the large countries. But in general, particularly the U.K., has been very good. Germany has been good. France may be a little bit lighter. And in many of the areas where you see macro government issues, we're not seeing the issues in our accounts. So Western Europe has been remarkably resilient through this, and the eastern areas have been very strong. So we clearly continue to see some investment of those traditional Western European companies being put into the areas in Eastern Europe. But even despite that, we're seeing good performance in our traditional Western European geographies.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then one last quick one. You guys had more of an emphasis, it seemed like, on software earlier this year, Pittcon. Are you seeing software as a vehicle to kind of drive instrument sales? And can you just talk about UNIFI and how you're viewing the software?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, Tycho, to be fair, software has always been an important part of our systems approach. And I would think certainly in the sophisticated user community, going back to our -- going back even before Millennium, but Millennium and Empower have -- had overwhelming market shares in those applications. But of course, when mass spec became a more significant part of our product line and the various software products proliferated between HPLC and mass spec, that's when we saw the need to really manage this within one platform, and that was the birth of UNIFI. I think it's been a long haul. It's been a massive project. And you're beginning to see us move into the market with the early iterations of it, particularly with our introduction of the bioproduct earlier this year. But the real significant launches of that come over the next year and a half as UNIFI really kind of replaces our existing software platforms. We think that's going to be a major significant market-moving dynamic, but it's not going to come this year. And so it's a very important strategic position for us. You may see the results kind of embodied within a system sale as opposed to an individual software sale. But you're absolutely right that it's an important part of our R&D spending, and it's an important strategic part of our future system sales.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "On the SG&A line, so you talked about the new product launches. You also talked about FX. Were there some FX volatility in the quarter that you didn't expect that caused the number to be higher? And then as you look out in the back half of the year, could you repeat again what you said in the prepared remarks about your FX expectations which affect margins?", "John Ornell", "Yes. As it relates to the second quarter, we had a expectation that currency would lift expenses by 5%. And instead of that, the expenses were lifted about 6.5% associated with currency. So the -- versus original expectations, we had a somewhat stronger euro than I had originally forecast, and that lifted the expenses in the European area that lifted up our percent and higher the overall translated costs versus the original plan. So that was about 1/2 of the overage in SG&A that -- versus what I had expected. And then secondly, we had about another 1.5% growth in SG&A organically associated with the activities around the new products that we felt was warranted given the impact that those products would have later in the year. And then in the second half guidance on currency, we said that currency in the third quarter would be 4 points of pleasure on the top line. That will be modestly accretive to the gross margin performance. Gross margins as a percent of sales, I think will be very comparable to what we saw in the second quarter. And in the fourth quarter, it looks like currency is going to be about 2% positive based on where rates are today.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then as a follow-up, Doug, you -- I appreciate the color on what you see as in terms of the competitive environment and market share. What are you seeing in ASPs? I mean, are your products, especially the new products, are the customers comfortable with that? Or are they expecting maybe more discounting given their budgetary pressures?", "John Ornell", "Well, I think you can see from our margins that we're not seeing extraordinary discounting, Quintin. And I would say that we're not facing anything unusual. We still see that customer -- frankly, you can just look at the product, look at the G2-S. It is the how -- the mass spec product line. And it's premium price, not discount price. You always in individual competitive situations have customers who might be trying to get an extra point or 2 of discount. That's kind of noise level in our business. I wouldn't say that there's any overall dynamic that suggests that prices are going downstream. I think they're holding. And the product mix may actually be suggesting it leans more. The I-Class is a more premium priced product than the ACQUITY that it will ultimately replace. The G2-S is a higher-end product. So -- and the DSC in TA's world has very good prices and very good margin. So I just don't see any overall dynamic that would lead me in that direction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I just want to ask a first one on pharma spending. Could you maybe speak to any customer concentration that might have impacted the late second quarter dynamic that you mentioned? And then could you also comment on any progress you had that was measurable regarding attach rates for H-Class on this quarter?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, Isaac. The concentration question, could you repeat that?", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Yes, was there any handful of large pharma customers that really drove the dynamic late in the quarter that you mentioned around the 4th of July? Or was it more broad based among a wide range of large pharmas?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, I -- there were a couple absolutely notable ones that we're working and we thought we'd close in the second quarter that ultimately closed in the first 2 weeks of July. So I'd say we can point to specific issues. But I\u2019d say the overall dynamic of the large pharma accounts being softer in the second quarter than the first quarter wasn\u2019t a 1 or 2. That was a broader dynamic. It's never 100%. I mean, we had some good performing accounts, but it was more broad based than we expected, particularly coming out of the first quarter.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got you. And then a follow-up was on the attach rates for the H-Class. Any noticeable uptick in the attach rates? And I had another question on expenses.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I wouldn't say noticeable uptick. It still continues to be good.", "John Ornell", "The chemistry growth was double digit actually this quarter, and it was the ACQUITY columns that really drove that increase, attaching it specifically to H-Class versus traditional ACQUITY card. But certainly, the ACQUITY columns continue to be the driver of growth in the chemistry business and pushing it to double digit.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. And then just one last one from me on expenses. Gross margins there looked a little better. And I'm wondering how we should think about the impact of the continued volume ramp in H-Class for the back half of the year and what that impact would be on gross margins. And then along with that, I think you mentioned the SG&A run rate having had a bit of a blip in the second quarter related to ASMS. Is that the right run rate to look at in the back half exclusive of sort of your revenue ramp?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "As it relates to margins, in the third quarter, I said that you'd see the gross margin percentage being comparable to what you saw in the second. Could the H-Class placements drive that a little bit higher? I mean, that's possible. But my model right now would suggest that you think about the third quarter having a gross margin percentage comparable to the second quarter. That will actually be a fairly good relative comparison to Q3 last year where the margins were under 60%. And then in the fourth quarter, the volume leverage typically pushes the gross margins even beyond the high end of the range that I\u2019ve supplied, the 61%, pushing the full year then somewhere between 60.5% and 61%. So I'd say the new products are likely to somewhat favorably affect margins, but that's kind of built in to some extent to the model that I'm describing to you. On SG&A, we're looking at still a little bit more of a difficult comparison in the third quarter. So I'm going to model SG&A growing about with sales there. And that does include 4 points of currency translation. And then by the fourth quarter, you're going to see the SG&A growth rate be maybe half the growth rate thereabouts of what you see on the sales line as a result of a rather easy base of comparison as we had a growth in the expenses in the fourth quarter and we had an overage in the fourth quarter's performance where there was a bit more variable compensation cost included in the fourth quarter that we've spread across the quarters this year.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it, got it.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "I just wanted to round out the comments on geography, comment on India and India alone. And then the second question is -- and again, apologies for increasing questions on the pharmaceutical side end market, but could you focus some thoughts or some questions around just the generic manufacturers? What are you seeing there? Has that been a change as well? And had that been part of the delay in Q2? Or has that been a steady run rate?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "India continues to do well. It is true that India did a little slower growth in the quarter than they had in the past couple of quarters. But I don't think it's anything extraordinary. They had always planned that this quarter, it was up against a good comparison last year. And I don't think it's anything to particularly worry about. We're still anticipating good, double-digit growth coming out of India in the second half. So I think India continues to be a situation that's consistent with what we've seen for the past year or so. Generics were I'd say consistent with the experience that we had across the pharma. We had some very good performance, some not-so-good performance. And overall, we saw a slower growth rate in generics in the second quarter than we did in the first. Again, we don't think that's related to any consistent dynamic. We think that's the -- just almost serendipity. We don't hear a consistent story coming out of those. We fully expect that we're going to continue to see good growth coming out of generics as we go along. So...", "John Ornell", "It was a rather tough comp on the generics.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Those were tough comps in the second quarter of last year, and we see nothing out of those accounts other than good, long-term expectations of higher investments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Gleacher.", "Sung Ji Nam - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "So you guys launched a lot of products in the last 12, 18 months. And could you maybe prioritize or rank for us kind of the biggest growth drivers going forward from these product launches? And also maybe talk about how much growth going forward is coming from market expansion versus product replacement cycles?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure. I think in the very near past, last year we launched the TQ-S tandem quadrupole that was specifically aimed at taking some share in the regulated bioanalysis marketplace. And this year, we combined that with the new I-Class for our Regulated Bioanalysis System. So that I-Class was just launched at ASMS, so you didn't see any result of that in our second quarter results. But the TQ-S has had excellent response in the marketplace. It has led to good, strong, double-digit triple quad performance consistently since its introduction. And we anticipate that continuing to happen. The new TQD that we launched at ASMS, again we'll start to see results from that in the second half of this year. We're doing well in the applied markets. That's principally where we'll focus the TQD, the Xevo TQD as we're terming it. And I think that will continue the momentum there. The second half results will probably most be affected by the SYNAPT G2-S where we launched that at ASMS. We're already seeing response in our order rate. We're expecting significant shipments of that in the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So I would say that on the high-end side, the I-Class introduction on the UPLC front, I think, marks a further pushing of the envelope in the UPLC sphere. It by far will be the best performing UPLC. We expect it will dominate the front end of mass spectrometers and should take a good position in classic UPLC applications and those high-end research applications. So I guess that's the order that I suggest. Good possibility in Regulated Bioanalysis from the TQ-S and the I-Class, and we expect strong results from the SYNAPT G2-S. I think, operator, in the interest of time, we can probably take one more question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Knight [ph] with CLSA.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Doug, did academic get better as the quarter concluded?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "No. I'd say it was pretty consistent. I mean, we really saw that -- it became more and more reinforced, I'd say, as the quarter went along. But it wasn't...", "John Ornell", "And it was really, I'd say, post-ASMS that we really began to see more interest than we originally anticipated in some of the -- specifically the G2-S. And the business there tailed off meaningfully after that and has created some order backlog since then. But it was really -- that one was more pronounced associated with the new product offerings.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Okay, I think I appreciate everybody staying on even a little past our normal time. And hopefully, we covered all those questions. If you have any more, I'm sure Gene and John will be standing by to answer the more detailed financial questions. And we\u2019ll look forward to updating you next quarter. Thank you all for sticking with us.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded.  [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you. Well and good morning, and welcome to this, the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call as usual is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations. And as it's our normal practice, I'm going to start with an overview of the quarter's highlight, and then John will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with an outlook for the first quarter of 2012 and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John A. Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will be making various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q1 and full year 2012. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.", "For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, under Part I, captioned Business Risk Factors. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2012.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share included in this morning's press release.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well, 2011 was a second consecutive year of double-digit sales growth and even faster earnings growth for Waters. Successful new product launches and healthy demand from our pharmaceutical customer base have been key factors in driving our growth. In addition, we continue to benefit from faster growth in developing countries and opportunities associated with our applied markets such as food testing and clinical diagnostics.", "In short, we have offered industry-leading products and enjoy superior access to faster growing market segments, positions our organizations have worked high to achieve over a multiyear period.", "I think it's also important to note that 2011 was a year of investment for Waters. During the year, we continued to bring new systems to market across all our major product lines and expanded field personnel to support rapidly expanding customer bases in these developing regions. We're confident that we have an adequate foundation to grow top and bottom line results in 2012, while maintaining our reputation for industry-leading customer service and support.", "If you'll look at the fourth quarter, our sales grew organically 8%, and our adjusted earnings per share were up 13%. And all these results were a bit ahead of our expectations and represent the impact of continued strong business momentum.", "For the Waters division, we saw strongest growth in our pharmaceutical and industrial chemical end markets. The pharmaceutical growth was particularly strong in Western Europe and in the U.S., indicative of a continuation of an instrument upgrade cycle that I cited earlier this year.", "The combination of government and university shipments held up reasonably well during the quarter, most notably for the SYNAPT G2 system shipments that were delivered to academic institutions throughout the quarter. Going forward, as a result of continuing austerity measures, we expect less robust global sales to government agencies in Europe, Japan and the U.S. That's a segment that has recently accounted for about 5% of our worldwide sales.", "A tough base of comparison limited the growth rate of our food analysis business in the quarter. You may recall, we benefited from food safety-related business in late 2010, especially from sales resulting from dairy product testing in China. As a result of these strong results in the prior year quarter, our Chemical Analysis business, which includes food and environmental testing, grew more slowly in this quarter.", "Within the Waters division, constant currency sales to the pharmaceutical industry grew faster than the overall business. Applications within pharma that are driving growth include biopharmaceutical development and QC testing. Similarly to what we saw in the third quarter, business to CROs was robust, while sales to generic manufacturers were adversely impacted by slower growth in India.", "Instrument sales to industrial chemical customers, a business that represents less than 10% of our sales, held up fairly well in the quarter with strength in developing markets in Asia and South America offsetting slower growth in Europe and the United States.", "Our TA Division finished 2011 with a strong fourth quarter performance that completed a year of profitable growth with yet another double-digit sales growth quarter. During the quarter, the division benefited from sales of its new Discovery DSC and Discovery Hybrid Rheometer, these instruments that saw a balanced sales growth across major geographical regions.", "In 2012 and beyond, TA will expand its system offerings with more Discovery-branded instruments, while continuing to expand its applications footprint into biological and high temperature material testing opportunities.", "If you look at our sales geographically, constant currency sales growth in Europe, as we saw in the third quarter, exceeded our overall sales performance. Expected weakness in European government and academic labs was more than offset by strength in our pharmaceutical and chemical analysis segments. European pharmaceutical strength was largely outside of large multinational accounts and more focused on CRO and biopharmaceutical businesses.", "Within chemical analysis applications, our European strength was most pronounced for food and environmental testing. In Asia, outside of Japan, our sales growth in China reflects the impact of large regulatory related pharmaceutical and food analysis shipments in the prior year quarter, and with these factors backed out of the prior year result, business trends in China continued to be strong and in line with our expectations.", "Sales in India were somewhat lighter than we had expected, as a significant evaluation of the rupee within the quarter resulted in some ordering delays. Underlying demand for new instruments, primarily for generic drug makers in India, remains strong, and we anticipating seeing stronger ordering trends during the first half of 2012.", "Waters division constant currency sales in Japan were about flat for the quarter, as relatively strong pharmaceutical sales were offset by declines in government and university sales. Though the general economic conditions in Japan are challenging, we feel that our competitive position is strong and that there could be an opportunity to grow our business there, as we anniversary the terrible earthquake and tsunami that hit last March.", "In the United States, we benefited from strong chromatography instrument shipments to pharmaceutical accounts, continuing the trend of the H-Class adoption that we saw earlier in the year. Sales to combined university and government labs grew in the quarter, and we fulfilled orders for newly introduced instrument systems. As we saw in Europe, our strongest growth in the U.S. was for instrumentation for our applied markets, including food and environmental testing.", "Now I'd like to talk about some of the product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables grew, at a high-single-digit rate in the quarter. The growth in chromatography consumables was driven by column sales in developing countries including China and India, while the growth of our service business was geographically balanced.", "Looking at our Waters division instrument system sales, growth was comparable for LC/MS instruments and LC instruments in the quarter. Key new systems introduced at ASMS, including our SYNAPT G2-S and ACQUITY I-Class UPLC, shipped throughout the quarter. Our tandem quadrupole growth was highest for the ultrasensitive Xevo TQ-S system. And during the quarter we introduced a new single quadrupole mass detector, the SQD 2. This new component has been designed to offer greater versatility, ease of use and reliability for routine mass detection. In addition, it provides users with Waters' universal source design to facilitate methods transferred from our Xevo and SYNAPT platforms.", "On the chromatography front, UPLC instrument unit shipments again grew at a double-digit rate, with H-Class dominating ACQUITY sales. Throughout the quarter, we manufactured and delivered ACQUITY I-Class instruments, primarily its front-end technology for our new research mass spec platforms.", "If you look back at full year 2011, the big story for us in LC has been the H-Class. Growth in shipments and revenues has consistently exceeded 20% through 2011 off of a strong 2010 performance. We feel we are entering 2012 with excellent momentum for our entire ACQUITY line and feel that there remains for us a very attractive opportunity to displace HPLC and routine testing and expand the application reach of liquid chromatography by promoting the performance, ease of use and reliability of UPLC.", "In 2012, look for us to continue to introduce new application-tailored systems that offer more complete workflow benefits to customers. Generally, these systems will combine advanced mass spectrometry, ACQUITY UPLC and our new UNIFI platform, with application-specific chemistries and software applications.", "Examples of this approach can be found in the well-received systems we commercialized in 2011, including our systems for regulated bioanalysis and biopharmaceutical characterization.", "Financially, we are very pleased with our 2011 performance. As I mentioned earlier, 2011 was a year of significant investment for Waters, as we continued to introduce advanced instrument systems, to invest in the development and commercialization of our new UNIFI software platform and to bolster our field operations in the developing world. While doing all of the above, we managed to expand our operating margins and generate record free cash flow, about $0.25 of free cash flow for every sales dollar.", "Looking at capital allocation, we primarily used our free cash to fund the continuation of our share repurchase program, a program that over the years has reduced our share count by 1/3 and meaningfully grown our earnings per share without adding risks to future earnings growth.", "In 2011, we continued on our targeted and relatively conservative acquisition plan. Our most recent acquisition enhanced the capability of our TA group to more quickly access business opportunities in high temperature materials testing.", "This type of smaller acquisition is emblematic of our strategy and is a template for what we are likely to pursue in the upcoming years. But we can never rule out a more transformational M&A plan. It continues to be difficult for us to identify larger targets that in the long run will be accretive to our long-term sales growth and profitability.", "Looking at 2012, we currently see fundamental consistency to the underlying drivers of our recent growth. Early in the year, we will be comparing our business to performance in 2011, where in a strong top line accompanied by conservative spending combined to create a tough base of comparison for operating income growth. However, as we ramp SG&A spending during 2011, the comparisons will likely become more favorable in the second half of 2012, allowing us to achieve higher operating leverage.", "Macroeconomic uncertainties that have dominated recent headlines, including concerns about the health of European markets and global governmental austerity programs, are the primary factors in tempering our 2012 growth expectations relative to the results that we have delivered during the past 2 years. We feel that our strong product positions and our access to growing markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe position us well to weather through the uncertainties I've already cited.", "Globally, we will remain confident that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to require our products for research and regulatory compliance applications, and we are also confident that our application-tailored system strategy will allow us to both secure a competitive advantage and expand our business into new application areas.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to John for a more detailed review of our financials and the outlook.", "John A. Ornell", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Fourth quarter sales increased by 8%, and non-GAAP earnings per share per diluted share were up 13% at $1.56 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.38 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.51 this quarter versus $1.36 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.", "Reviewing Q4 sales results in comparison to Q4 last year, sales were up 8% with foreign currency translation about neutral to sales growth within the quarter. Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 8%. Europe's sales were up 14%. Japan was flat and sales in Asia, outside of Japan, were down 1% against a strong base of comparison of more than 30% growth in the 2010 quarter.", "On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 7% and recurring revenues grew by 7% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 17% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q4 and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in as expected at 60.8% comparable to Q4 last year. SG&A expenses increased by 2% this quarter, slightly less than expected as a result of less FX translation impact. R&D expenses increased as expected at about 4% within the quarter, and our full year effective operating income tax rate came in a little lower than anticipated at 16%. This is due to a modest shift in profits among our legal entities favoring our lower tax rate jurisdictions. Applying this tax rate to our full year pretax income increased EPS by $0.03 this quarter versus our October expectation.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion and debt totaled $991 million, bringing us to a net cash position of about $290 million. As for share repurchases, we bought 940,000 shares of our common stock for $73 million. This leaves $186 million remaining on the current authorized share repurchase program.", "We defined free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.", "For Q4, free cash flow came in at $150 million after funding $17 million of CapEx and adding back $3 million of noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation. This result excludes $16 million of capital spending associated with a land purchase this quarter for our new site in Manchester, U.K.", "Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 64 days this quarter, down 3 days from Q4 last year. And inventories declined by $35 million this quarter, as new products shipped in expected volumes and the traditional heavier Q4 volume consumed inventories built up earlier in the year.", "Overall, we are pleased with our full year 2011 financial performance, as we grew sales 10% in constant currency. This performance was geographically balanced and on the back of a 10% organic growth year in 2010. Gross margins expanded by 30 basis points in 2011, and operating margin expanded by 1%, as we leveraged our cost base around the world. And our non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share for the full year were up 18% over 2010.", "Cash flow was very strong this year, too, with free cash flow of $461 million after funding $68 million of capital spending and adding back $18 million of noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. This result again excludes $16 million of capital spending on the new Manchester, U.K. facility. Of this free cash flow, $11 million was used on M&A, and $314 million was used to purchase $4.5 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program.", "As we now think about 2012, we continue to see stability in the majority of our markets and continued momentum in the acceptance of our new products. However, we may see pockets of weakness in our government and academic segment as the year plays out given the budgetary pressures many countries are facing, particularly in Western Europe and the U.S. So we believe that it makes sense to begin 2012 with a more cautious growth outlook than what we have recently experienced, and we currently expect sales to grow by 6% to 8% for 2012 before currency effects.", "Currency at today's levels is expected to reduce full year sales growth by 2%. Reported sales growth, then, would be between 4% and 6%.", "Moving down the P&L, gross margins are expected to be about flat with 2011 at about 16.5%. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate that is slightly less than sales, as we continue to manage our operating expenses judiciously. Our net interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to be about 16%.", "Our fully diluted average outstanding share count is likely to be just under 90 million shares outstanding, and rolling all of this together, we currently expect 2012 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in a range of $5.15 to $5.30 per share.", "As we think about our expectations for the first quarter of 2012, please remember that 2011 started off extremely strong with 16% sales growth and 28% earnings growth. Against this challenging base of comparison, we expect organic sales growth of about 5% in the first quarter of 2012.", "Currency translation at today's rates would reduce sales by 2%, resulting in reported sales growth of about 3%. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.10 for the first quarter. Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Operator, I think at this point, we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "You again highlighted resilience in the pharmaceutical end market, both in the U.S. and Europe. You attributed this to an ongoing replacement cycle. Could you just provide any color that's available on how balanced this replacement cycle is across LC and mass spec and also how balanced this replacement cycle is across the different subsegments within pharma, meaning CROs, generics and big pharma?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Okay, sure, Doug. I can give you a little bit of flavor on that. The quarter was remarkably balanced, I'd say, between LC and mass spec, very similar results. If you look within pharma, CROs were the strongest players, and our big pharmaceutical customers were flattish. So that's probably, I think, been a continuing dynamic. Although, we did see an absolute level of growth from our big pharma customers as you move quarter-to-quarter through 2011. I'd say the applications that were notable for their growth -- first of all, H-Class is -- continues to be the strongest performer in the chromatography area, and we see some clear signs that, that's penetrating into the pharmaceutical QC applications and that's penetration. So that's, I think, good news for us. At the same time, some of our new systems offerings that are aimed at the bio area, biopharmaceutical QC in particular, which is a different animal of course versus the small molecule world, are doing very well. So I think those are probably the notable dynamics.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And in H-Class specifically, I mean, you've done quite well there. There's a big install base to go after in -- of the alliance instruments within big pharma. How would you characterize what inning you're in, in terms of replacing those instruments with H-Class?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Oh, I think we're still early in the game there. We're really only in the second -- 2011 was the second year of the H-Class introduction, and I'd say we really only started penetrating those applications this past year. So I think we're early on, and we're very optimistic about the long-term opportunity there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "I just had 2 quick questions. The first, Doug, is I guess maybe if you could provide a little more color geographically around how you expect things to play out in 2012. Obviously, you ended the quarter where Asia x Japan is down a little bit, and you were up like 32% last year. But maybe just talk geographically about how you see things playing out. And then, John, I was just wondering if you could -- you mentioned kind of flattish gross margins. I know currency probably is a little bit of an issue there. Can you maybe just talk about kind of organically what's happening on the gross margin line?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure. I think -- in term -- the way to think about our outlook geographically is you think about the -- what we call the emerging areas. I mean, we continue to use that terminology. Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, we strongly believe that those areas are going to grow above our corporate average in 2012. That's been true in the past, it's likely to be very true in 2012. We've got the applications, the organization and the momentum going there, and I think that's very credible. We think the areas of slower growth is still likely to be Western Europe. There's enough uncertainty around elements in Western Europe. Even though we're coming off a very good quarter, we're still a little cautious about Western Europe going forward. And Japan, we are hopeful that we see some relief, just structural relief in Japan, but we're going to wait to see that. The U.S., I think, is probably going to be around the corporate average. So that breaks that. John, you want to cover the...", "John A. Ornell", "Sure. On the gross margin, the thinking there is that we've got a little bit less volume leverage at a top line growth that's 6% to 8% instead of the 10% we just came off of. We plan on having a higher mix of Tof-based products in the mix, which tends to pull the margin down a little bit. And as you said before, Jon, FX is a little bit of a headwind. So there's small amounts of tenths of a point movement, plus or minus to kind of net to a rather flat position versus 2011.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Can you hear me okay?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Quintin, are you there?", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Hello?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. We're ready.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So again looking into the 2012 guidance, you talked a little bit about maybe a cautious look on the academic side. What are you seeing on the pharma side, Doug? Continued uptick? Is it new products? Or is it also just replacement of some of the changing out the aging instruments as well?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, Quintin, we have some natural benefit from products that were introduced in the second half of 2011, getting full bore in 2012, as well as focused application systems, like the regulated bioanalysis system, which combines the I-Class with the TQ-S and the system for biopharmaceutical QC. All of which were introduced kind of during 2011 and should provide us incremental growth in 2012. I think if you look at applications or broad areas of our business for next year, we think the broadscale pharma business is likely to grow at about our corporate average. We think the application-specific areas like food safety, food testing, clinical are likely to grow a little bit above average, and the government and academic business is going to grow below average. That's kind of the mix of our plan for 2012.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then with respect to kind of new product introductions, you launched the TQ-S, I guess, 2 now. And last year, you introduced I-Class early on in the year. Is it now that new products will just get launched when they're ready or off the cycle of waiting for big conferences like ASMS?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think generally you'll find that major LC introductions are still made around Pittcon and major -- particularly higher-end mass specs are introduced around ASMS. So that's first quarter for Pittcon, late second quarter kind of for ASMS. That's still traditionally -- now you may introduce a system and not be shipping it for a couple of months. I mean, you typically don't want to wait much more than 2 or 3 months before you're ready to ship it because you're getting expectations and you're maybe cannibalizing your existing product line. So I think that, that's pretty much par for the course in the industry, and it's just the introductions don't necessarily closely follow for shipments.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess my first question would be on the competitive dynamics. This is an issue that we get asked about a whole lot, and I was wondering if you could talk about any market shares, dynamics in your key technology and markets about LC/MS, please.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, it's always dangerous to talk about change in market share dynamics based on one quarter. So I think there's nothing that I would feel comfortable about saying as a result of the fourth quarter. If you look at the full year and you look at our organic instruments growth, it was north of 10%. I think it's pretty -- I'm pretty secure in saying I think overall, we picked up market share in 2011. I think H-Class continues to penetrate into new labs and new applications that we didn't serve before. So I'm pretty comfortable with that. I think the introduction of our new mass spec systems has clearly garnered us new business. But I think in general, I think, that mass spec business continues to be very competitive. Nobody's getting out of the business, and so I think it continues to be a pretty vibrant, competitive area for all of us suppliers.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess, I was wondering with the consolidation that we've seen in the industry and more sort of LC/MS full suite of offerings coming from competitors, sort of wondering if that has changed anything.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Oh, I'd say certainly coming from consolidate -- I don't see any major dynamic going on as a result of consolidation. Certainly, not at this point. I'd say the competition that we're looking at, particularly in the mass spec arena, come from the same places we have seen it for the last 5 years, using the same competitive tools. And I don't see very much in the way of shifts resulting from consolidation there.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I really appreciate the commentary. And maybe one quick one for John on the gross margins. I know you mentioned the Tofs in the mix. But John, could you talk a little bit more around just the instrumentation system that we see some amount of slowdown on the instrumentation side and mix shifts towards the recurring revenues? What sort of benefit can we see from maybe include detach rates on consumables or a revenue pickup from your service investments last year?", "John A. Ornell", "I guess I'd say generally, Nandita, that we're looking at growth rates for 2012 that are relatively comparable for instruments and recurring revenue. So if there's going to be a mix shift in the year, it's going to be rather small. So I wouldn't think it would result in more than a 10 basis point change from flat. So I would say it's possible but not likely to be that significant.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "On the Asia x Japan business, obviously tough comp in the quarter. As we sort of move into Q1 with the Chinese New Year a little bit earlier this year, do you have sort of comfort in sort of stabilization acceleration in that business based on sort of the order patterns we sort of ended the quarter with x some of those onetime headwinds from last year? And are we seeing that -- any confirmation of that in Q1 so far?", "John A. Ornell", "I'd say as we look at the base of comparison and the pace of business in Asia, we're pretty comfortable that we're back to our more traditional growth rate in that region of the world. We've got a year-end spend in India that we expect to see come through and the base of comparison in China's easier. So the expectation is for meaningful growth coming out of that region of the world pretty early in the year.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Were you at all surprised by the magnitude of sort of the strength in late December? I mean, I know the world was sort of an odd place from the summer through the early fall to winter just from a uncertainty perspective. But it seemed like we've seen some decent follow-through in the month of December in terms of re-acceleration. Were you kind of surprised by that on the capital equipment side at all?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I wouldn't say we were terribly surprised. I think the fourth quarter, always when completing the year you're -- you want to finish strong, but there was nothing remarkable, I don't think, that went on in the fourth quarter. I know there was some cautiousness on the part of observers of the industry, but we didn't -- the quarter was well balanced, interestingly. It wasn't like we saw late strength in any particular area that pulled out the quarter, so I think the balance is kind of what's notable in the results.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just lastly, John, what are the rates you're using for the FX cal? Because we're getting Q1, as well as the year, even on current rate, something, I think, a bit less of a headwind than sort of what you provided.", "John A. Ornell", "I'm using the euro at somewhere around 128, 129; the yen, somewhere around 77; and the pound around 153. There are a basket of other currencies throughout the world that we do consider. These are the major currencies, but there are Canadian dollar, the Aussie dollar. There's other places that need to be considered. And I'm coming up with kind of a weak 2% effect in the first quarter, pretty full to a 2% effect for the full year, Ross.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "What scenarios for government funding are in your forecast? Do you assume something like an 8% cut to the NIH budget? Or are you assuming something less than that? If you could just walk me through that.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "The NAIH -- the NIH budget isn't all of that important to our run rates, Dan. It's -- Oh, Christ, John, what's the amount that's directly...", "John A. Ornell", "$15 million or so direct. As a percent of our business, 2 at the very most. You try to roll in as best we can.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. And government spending overall, yes, is not that -- but it's clearly an area of cautiousness. I mean it's -- particularly it's an area of not only in the U.S. but in Japan and in Western Europe. So we are anticipating that, that is going to be slower next year than we saw this year, and it's probably going to be more flattish than anything else.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. What are your expectations from your generic customer base given that we're in peak year of the cliff here? Do you expect they're going to continue buying as usual? Or did you see anything like a big bump in orders in advance of the genericization cliff that maybe will present a tough comp?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think you're really going to -- we think about the generic business kind of in 2 parts. A big part being in India and another big part being almost everywhere else. Some of it within big pharma companies. Some is independent, stand-alone generics. Clearly in India, we saw a slowdown in the fourth quarter that our accounts tell us is solely due to the weakness in the rupee and the need to recalculate their budgets and redo their capital. They're highly optimistic about returning to a significant growth phase as we go into 2012. We've seen that kind of behavior before, and we believe that, that's going to happen. If you look at the rest of our generic business, it was a good year in 2011. I see no indication on the part of those accounts that they've stopped investing for the future. And I think we're pretty confident as these accounts look at the productivity capabilities in UPLC that this is another area where the move to UPLC is likely to continue and offer us growth opportunities going forward. So overall, I'd say generics look good for 2012.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to get a little bit more color on the industrial chemical business segment. You talked about Europe and U.S. having slower growth. Can you put some numbers around that and give us some detail about how you're thinking about that segment in 2012?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, I think we're a little bit cautious as we think about Western Europe and maybe a little bit of impact associated with a lower GDP in that region of the world. So we've seen, across this year, relatively strong growth in our industrial business including reasonable growth in that geography. We think we might see that business in Western Europe slow down. I think offsetting that to some extent is we have some pretty good confidence that with the TA division, there's a number of products that are recently introduced and others that are coming that will continue to drive growth at least in their portion of that industrial segment. So seeing it move to a mid-single-digit growth from a double-digit growth or a high-single-digit growth is probably a reasonable way to think about that business as we think about a 6% to 8% business overall. I'm not including in that food safety and other applications that I think will grow faster, but the segments that go to the Dows, DuPonts the 3Ms and their equivalent counterparts overseas are likely to be under a bit more pressure, we feel, in '12 as we move forward.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think the good news is that those accounts generally are in good financial condition. They have improved their balance sheets, improved their earnings. So that might be an area where the results exceed our expectations coming up. Certainly, TA, you might consider is a little bit of a canary in a mineshaft, the kind of a high preponderance of business in those industrial accounts, particularly polymer application. And there's no real signs of slowing there. So that might be an area where we prove to be a little more conservative than the actuals.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And just a quick follow-up, John, on the SG&A, can you just talk a little bit about the cadence for the year? Should it be flat throughout given the investments you've already made? Or are there any particular quarters where we should expect any bump ups in the absolute SG&A expense for 2012?", "John A. Ornell", "No, I don't think there's anything from a base of comparison that's, that difficult. I think you'll see SG&A track the sales growth minus 0.5 point to maybe 1.5 points difference in growth rate, if you will, across the year. So I would not expect to see major deltas by quarter as we think about the 4 quarters of '12 versus '11.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We did ramp up SG&A a little bit across 2011, so the comparisons are a little bit tougher in the first quarter and easier in later in the year.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, but not dramatically so.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just following up on some of the pharma questions earlier. Obviously, you saw some nice momentum here in that business. You talked about it growing faster than the overall business. Given where we are in the QA/QC adoption cycle for ACQUITY, why couldn't that continue to outgrow the overall business? I think your comment before was that could be closer to flattish for the year for large pharma.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "No, I said large pharma -- let me repeat myself. Large pharma overall in the fourth quarter was flat growth, but it -- we did show incremental revenue from those large pharma, that we're talking the top 15 to 20 account sequentially during the year. So fourth quarter was the biggest quarter of the year, but it often is. So -- and pharma all in for the fourth quarter grew at the corporate average. So those are the facts. H-Class, for both the quarter and the year was the fastest-growing LC in our business, and the fastest-growing applications for H-Class were in small molecule QC, so just so we understand our factual situation. Now we think H-Class is going to continue to grow faster in those applications. It's really a question in pharma as to where the balance of that business comes in next year, R&D spending across the base of big accounts, generics and other biotech accounts. So right now, we're saying that, that's likely to be at the corporate average next year. If we see stronger penetration in the H-Class across the small molecule world, that's likely to be a benefit. But that's what we've got modeled in our expectation for 2012.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And are you seeing interest from customers for standardizing on H-Class? I know you had some customers previously standardize on ACQUITY before you launched H-Class, so just wondering if you're seeing that as well.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'd say we're seeing customers standardize on ACQUITY UPLC technology. We have some very clear examples of that. That may mean that they're using I-Class in research applications with mass spec, and they're using H-Class. We're still seeing a kind of powerful story for these accounts who have traditionally used HPLC in their quality control who like the idea of buying H-Class, being able to use it for their traditional methods with their traditional chemistries, as they take a longer time to upgrade to true UPLC applications. What's interesting is we really are seeing them migrate to UPLC applications. It's all a question of the pace and the momentum that, that builds. But I think the evidence is pretty strong that, that's the direction they're going in.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then you guys recently announced the partnership with Tecan for clinical assay platforms, obviously using your existing technology. But just talk a little bit how you're thinking about the clinical opportunity going forward that you've obviously touched on in various parts of the mass spec business previously.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, I think the clinical applications are an interesting area. I'd say in the last several years, we have devoted more time and attention to clinical applications than we have historically. We've been particularly successful, I'd say, in providing systems for clinical monitoring in the anti-rejection, immunosuppressant marketplace. We're seeing good success in vitamin D analysis. And as we've gotten more intense in those areas and we've built our organization up, we've looked at more opportunities to utilize particularly the power and the broad-spectrum capabilities of mass spectrometry to penetrate into areas that more traditionally used other diagnostic tests. So I would say, we're investing pro-rata more in that area. We think there are many opportunities. It's a very broad category, monitoring of pain medications, forensic analysis. It's -- when we talk about clinical, it's a broad area. And I'd say overall, you'd see that area of our business grow faster than average over the next 5 years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "John, can you walk us through the cash assumptions in your modeling for '12, so specifically operating cash flow, CapEx, both the base level and whatever you're going to do on the micro mass facility and then your base assumptions for share repurchase, please?", "John A. Ornell", "Sure. Well, we think our net cash flow is going to be somewhere in the $500 million of free cash flow, if you will, after CapEx. CapEx is probably going to be somewhere around $75 million. Now that does not include capital that we'll deploy on the Manchester facility, which is likely to be somewhere between maybe $30 million and $35 million, depending on how quickly construction begins. As it relates to the share repurchase program, the guidance that I've provided contemplates share repurchases at about $70 million or so a quarter across the year in equivalent, but it's across the year. So about $280 million, $300 million or so in free cash flow procured evenly across the quarters for the year.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then the little acquisition you guys did in the third quarter, the contribution there, it basically rounds to 0, correct, on kind of the growth rate for '12?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, yes.", "John A. Ornell", "It's de minimis.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then, Doug, any comments just on the acquisition pipeline as it stands today? Are there more Anter-type acquisitions in the pipe? Or is there a midsized deal you see 6 to 12 months out? Just any commentary you can give us on...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, I would say more on the Anter, slightly larger sized, but not medium sized. The ones we're talking about range on the revenue line from $5 million in revenue to maybe $15 million to $20 million in annual revenue, and we're tending to be more successful on the smaller ones and they've done very well over time for us. So we like to continue it, and we like the risk profile. And we'd love to do a $50 million one that was just as good, but those are harder to find.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Doug, the slightly less than expected EPS guidance for 2012, is that mostly driven by the top line uncertainty or of -- in those difficult comps in one -- in the first half or the negative effects from FX on the P&L?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'm sorry. I didn't get the full gist. The slightly lower guidance for 2012, is that -- I'm sorry, I didn't get the implication.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Oh, and what are the moving parts there? Is it the top line uncertainty, the difficult comps in the first half or negative effects from FX on the P&L?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "The biggest change -- we see 2 dynamics, I'd say. We're a little more cautious about the university and government piece of the business,", " worldwide and the significant change in foreign currency year-over-year. And the foreign exchange, a 2% change. While we're relatively well hedged compared to a number of companies worldwide, there's no question that a stronger dollar does negatively affect our results. An estimate of how much that affects us next year's probably in the $0.10 range versus 2011. Is that's right, John?", "John A. Ornell", "$0.10 versus a flat currency scenario. So it's about $0.05 per point roughly. I mean, that can vary depending on which currency. But I would tell you that if we were talking about 6% to 8% growth with no currency impact, our earnings would be $0.10 or so higher than what we've described.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Got you. That's really helpful. And then the CRO strength, was that U.S. strength or emerging market?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "That's worldwide. I'd say we saw a real strength in Western Europe, but generally, it's a common dynamic in our business that the CROs were strong.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then just use of capital, is there a high likelihood of expanding that buyback program and the potential pacing at the existing buyback?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, it's been true for about 9 years now. So I see no reason why it's not likely to be true. It would be unusual in the extreme for us to do significantly less than that. If there were a large meaningful acquisition on the horizon, which we don't see, that would change things. But absent an unusual transaction, we would continue to deploy cash to buy back our stock.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I just want to dig in a little bit on the academic stuff. So John, you said or, Doug, you basically said that you had strong G2 sales to your academic customers in Q4. Were the orders placed -- everything's off the map on September it sounds like for a lot of the companies. Were the orders placed for the G2s that you shipped in Q4, were those placed prior September? Or were they after September? I'm just trying to see if we're seeing -- whether we're seeing order growth in the academic markets late in the year.", "John A. Ornell", "There's some of each, Derik. There's no doubt though that we ended -- we went into Q4 with a very meaningful backlog on the G2. We booked orders in the fourth quarter as well that we were able to satisfy, and we booked orders in the fourth quarter that are now in backlog leading into Q1. So just the fact that the product was slow coming out of manufacturing that we did build up a meaningful backlog both in the second and third quarter for that product though in particular.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", ", ", "For the last 2 years, you've grown R&D over 9%. How should we think about R&D growth for 2012? It sounds like -- I mean, you've done some major product introductions. I would expect to see some moderation.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, I'd say we're going to continue to spend on R&D as we need to. I would say that it's likely be closer to growth in sales than SG&A. It's possible in a quarter or 2 that you'll see as growing a bit faster than sales. Overall, we're not looking at changing in a meaningful way the percent of R&D, for some sales that R&D represents. But there will be some new products that will require some project expense. That's a little bit lumpy that you'll see across the quarters, but you're not talking about millions of dollars. You're talking $1 million perhaps in one quarter that's a little bit out of place versus prior year growth rate in one particular quarter that approaches 10%, for example, would be a pretty high expense in that quarter. So I don't think, in some total there's a lot of variability you'll see in our R&D spending as you think about this year versus history.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then just one final question. So I thought one of your more interesting product introductions in 2011 was the UNIFI system and just trying to integrate your CDS with your mass spec system. And how has that been received by the market? And I would assume that the bioanalytical was kind of the first launch with that. I assume that there's other ones coming with that. I guess, can you just talk a little bit about your -- what you're kind of seeing for uptick?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, I think, what you've seen us do first with UNIFI is launch it on specific application systems. So regulated bioanalysis and bio pharm. When the UNIFI platform kicks in as a major dynamic is when it's launched as the full-service upgrade to our Empower, both single system and network system applications. That won't happen in 2012. So you're going to continue to see it operate as a powerful software platform on a specific niche product this year. The reaction has been very good, but I wouldn't have you believe that it has a major impact on our software business in 2012.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Jeff Ares - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is actually Jeff, in for Isaac. Looking at the academic, government piece, you guys seem to be a little bit more cautious heading in 2012 than you were in 2011. I think one of the things you highlighted this quarter that was weak was Japan. Is the addition of Japan being another weak geographic area the source of the incremental concern? Or are you guys just kind of taking a more cautious approach?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'd say it's just generally a more cautious worldwide approach given the fact that we're almost certain to see government budgets be more conservative going forward, not only in the United States but certainly in Western Europe and in Asia. So it's a broader dynamic rather than specifically Japan. In Japan, we've had tough conditions, particularly in our segments where government spending, if anything, was tilted more towards the effects of the tsunami and the earthquake rather than into more classical broad-based R&D applications. So we might actually see a little bit of benefit in Japan, but that remains to be seen.", "Jeff Ares - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then kind of looking at it from the first half of this year and the second half versus what your outlook is for 2012, is it fair to say that your outlook is more cautious than what you experienced in the back half of this past year? Or is it kind of continuing the third quarter, fourth quarter run rate for the academic demand throughout '12?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I'd say our outlook for the first half is influenced more by the strength that we saw in the first half of our business last year, particularly the first quarter. Our fourth quarter, again, a bunch of dynamics going on there, but our absolute growth rate in the fourth quarter was a little bit lower than our full year growth rate and so that we're not expecting our run rates to change significantly as we go into 2012, but we are a little bit more cautious. particularly on the university and government side of our business. Combined with tough comparisons in the first half, I'd say that's the most notable structural difference in our outlook.", "Jeff Ares - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess what I'm asking is from the fourth quarter what you saw in U.S. -- or global academic government to what you're expecting for the full year for 2012. Are you expecting a sequential deceleration?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. We're thinking that government and academic could be flattish perhaps for 2012, and that's versus being up low- to mid-single-digit in 2011. So yes, we are thinking that it's possible that government agencies and the spend promoted by governments will be a little bit more pressured in '12 versus '11.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Arias with UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just wondering if this year we should expect some new products on the chemistry side for I-Class, and if so, what that might do for pricing or for margins on columns.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I wouldn't say anything unusual, but we will -- we're always introducing new flavors. But I wouldn't have you believe that a new platform introduction is imminent to affect that growth rate significantly, in really application-specific columns that are aimed as much as stimulating system sales as they are consumable sales.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then, Doug, I know you've commented on pharma quite a bit, but I guess just briefly, a lot of what we're hearing on biopharma in '12 is related to sort of the prioritization of late-stage projects towards trials maybe at the expense of some early-stage stuff. So -- but presumably this is not a new phenomenon. So I guess from your perspective, is there anything different about what you're hearing in the way that you're -- or the way that you're viewing to '12 versus '11 relative to project preferences?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think, certainly what one of the strongest application areas that we've seen in the second half of '11 is in biopharmaceutical QC. And that's, as you know, a much different animal than the typical QC applications for small molecular weight drugs. It's in some ways, more art than science there, but it's getting more refined and clearly demanding more advanced technologies like higher-end LC/MS. So we've been very gratified to see that our offerings in that biopharmaceutical world has been very well received. I think that is highly likely to continue through 2012. But I also think that particularly with monoclonal antibodies, a lot of research going on, a lot of that research pound for pound takes more higher-end analytical instrumentation than small molecule drugs. So I think that general dynamic works in our favor.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I just have 2 very quick ones. John, going back to growth margins, longer term, is there further headroom for growth aside from volume leverage? Or is it largely driven by product mix at this point?", "John A. Ornell", "Well, we've ended up over time with a manufacturing strategy that has moved products into Ireland, has moved products into Singapore, and across many years, we've been able to take advantage of that, both from a product cost perspective as well as a tax rate perspective. And I would tell you that right now, that program is pretty much complete. The businesses are growing with volume, but there aren't large numbers of products that continue to be ramped up to move into those lower-cost jurisdictions. All of that being said, when the business grows in the high-single digits, you're right. There's still volume leverage to be had, and thinking about the business, having 10, 20 basis points of gross margin expansion through the leverage of a fixed base of manufacturing cost is still true. We're a little cautious in stating that to flatly this year just given the fact that the lower end of our range perhaps doesn't provide all of that, and FX is a bit of a headwind this time. So I wouldn't say that the gross margin expansion party is over. Certainly, large leaps in the expansion are as a result of product transfers but small incremental movements with volume, which we continue to see as time goes forward.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And Doug, you mentioned in terms of the I-Class platform, primarily going as a front end to your research-based mass spectrometers. What component of that -- is it coming from product replacements of your legacy UPLC platform? And overtime, I would -- my question is what percentage of your overall legacy UPLC platform do you anticipate to be replaced with this I-Class platform?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think that's a very fair question. I think, currently, we'd say that I-Class is probably replacing classic ACQUITYs. And over time, you're probably going to see most of that research-grade ACQUITY translate from classic ACQUITY more to the I-Class. I think that will take a while. Certainly, we're pricing the I-Class at a premium to the classic UPLC, and we think that makes the most sense right now. But over time, those systems are likely to come together.", "Well, thank you all for being with us, and we appreciate high quality of questions and the interest.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call.  [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded.  [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you. Well, good  morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call, as usual, is John Ornell, the Waters Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "As our normal practice, I'll start with an overview of the quarter's results, and John will follow with details of our financials and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John A. Ornell", "On this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including statements regarding customer acceptance of our new products, international expansion of our business, spending by certain end markets that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For this purpose, any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. ", "The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements on this call for a variety of reasons, including and without limitation the impact of demand among the company's various market sectors from economic, sovereign and political uncertainties; increased regulatory burdens from the company's business as the company's business evolves, especially with respect to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others; shifts in taxable income in jurisdictions with different tax rates; the outcome of tax examinations or changes in respective country legislations affecting the company's effective tax rate; the ability to access capital and maintain liquidity in volatile financial market conditions; the timing of fluctuations in capital expenditures by the company's customers spanning multiple quarters or years, in particular pharmaceutical companies, governments and universities; the ability to sustain and enhance service and consumable demand by the company's installed base of instruments; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from competitors and customers; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles from product introductions; and other changes in demand from the effect of mergers and acquisitions by the company's customers; environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of products; risks associated with lawsuits and other legal options, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and intellectual property; foreign exchange fluctuations potentially affecting translation of the company's future non-U.S. operating results.", "Such factors and others are discussed more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors on the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which Risk Factors discussion is incorporated by reference on this call. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's estimates or views as of the date of this release and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimates or views as of any date subsequent to the date of this call. ", "Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well obviously, our sales in the first quarter fell short of our expectations as we encountered weaknesses in some developing markets and delays in capital releases from many of our larger pharmaceutical customers. However, as we look at the various pushes and pulls that resulted in the quarter's sales performance, I believe that the underlying demand for our product and services remains intact and that we will see improvements as we go through the rest of the year. ", "When you look at the first quarter, our sales were flat organically and our adjusted earnings per share declined 4%. For the Waters division, a geographical situation of the business is useful in understanding the quarter's sales trend. In the quarter, sales growth from the approximately 1/3 of the business that we derived from the developing regions, including non-Japan Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, did not provide the growth that we've seen in recent quarters. ", "Our instrument sales in India declined rather sharply due to the residual budgetary effects of a weaker rupee and deferments in capital spending at both generic drug makers and CROs. At the start of a new fiscal year, as we enter the second quarter and more favorable quarterly comparisons, we're anticipating a return to growth in India and are encouraged by an improving trend that we've begun to see earlier in the second quarter.", "In China, sales in the first quarter were up double digits based on strong industrial and governmental spending. Sales growth rates in the Middle East and Eastern Europe were weak in this quarter, and this weakness can be attributed to a tough base of comparison as well as the great amount of political instability in the region.", "For Western Europe and North America, delays in the release of capital budgets by larger multinational drug firms resulted in slower sales growth rate. The effect of these delays was most meaningful to our business in the U.S. Spending by smaller specialty and biopharma firms in the U.S. was more in line with our expectations and helped to at least partially offset the weakness in large pharma. ", "The combination of government and university shipments declined at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, with moderate academic growth offset by significant reductions in global governmental spending. Direct governmental spending was particularly weak in Europe and Japan. Our expectations for government and university spending were not very high for the first quarter, and we remain conservative on our outlook for the full year.", "When you look at a few positive trends in the quarter, our applied markets including food, environment and clinical diagnostics, all grew nicely and in line with our expectations. This growth was based considerably on strong shipments of UPLC, MS/MS tailored systems and was fairly balanced geographically and indicative of a continuation of an established growth trend in these applications. Sales growth to the more economically sensitive industrial chemicals segment held up well in the quarter for both our Waters and TA instruments division.", "Looking more closely at TA instruments, the division started the year off on a positive note with about 10% sales growth. TA has continued to benefit from sales of its new Discovery DSC, TGA and hybrid rheometer instruments and in addition, began to generate new business in high-temperature applications. Geographically, TA saw stronger sales growth in the U.S., Japan and China, all growing at strong double-digit rates.", "For instrument sales in the Waters division, highlights in the quarter included continued double-digit sales growth for H-Class ACQUITY UPLC and for our Xevo family of tandem quadrupole based systems, especially our ultrasensitive Xevo TQ-S. As I mentioned earlier today, the strength in tandem quadrupole MS based systems was primarily for applied market opportunities.", "Looking at LC instrument systems, the H-Class continues to drive lab upgrade business and a broad array of pharmaceutical opportunities, especially in drug development and quality control. It's notable that H-Class and Xevo TQ-S performed so well given the earlier cited general weakness in large-cap pharmaceutical spending. The decline in instrument sales we saw for the Waters division included the adverse impact of lower Alliance HPLC sales primarily related to the generic drug weakness in India. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew organically at a 7% rate in the quarter.", "Looking at new systems offerings in 2012, we are pleased with the positive reception we received from customers at this year's Pittsburgh Conference and more recently in Analytica in Germany. In fact, Waters was recognized with the Editors' Gold Award at Pittcon for our new UPC2 analytical technology platform. UPC2 affords us the opportunity to define a new chromatography business that effectively bridges applications that today are less effectively performed with either gas chromatography or liquid chromatography. We have demonstrated how, for certain analyses, UPC2 can work better, faster and in an environmentally friendlier manner. At Pittcon and at Analytica, we also showcased the family of ACQUITY columns to expand the application range of our UPC2 system.", "Other notable introductions at Pittcon included a new version of our NuGenesis informatics platform and a new line of chromatography reagents and standards. These new launches are in response to clearly expressed customer needs to streamline data workflow management and to simplify LC and LC/MS system calibration and validation.", "Before turning you over to John, I want to view our first quarter's performance on a broader context. We currently see factors that will result in better top line growth in the upcoming quarters and feel that the issues that resulted in slower growth at the start of the year are largely temporary. We expect our business momentum in China to continue, while other developing markets exhibit improved growth.", "Already, we have begun to see capital budget releases at some of our large accounts and our key product positions remain strong, with new product launch plans in place for later this year. In the meantime, we'll continue to carefully manage our expenses and deploy our strong free cash flow in a conservative manner that you've come to expect from us, share repurchases and smaller acquisitions. ", "In all, I'd like to reiterate my belief in our proven business strategy, and we're confident in our ability to accelerate our top and bottom line growth as we move through 2012.", "Now here's John with some further details on our financials.", "John A. Ornell", "Okay. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone. First quarter sales decreased by 2%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were down 4% at $1 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.04 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.98 this quarter versus $1.01 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning. Reviewing Q1 sales results in comparison to Q1 last year, before foreign currency translation, sales were flat with prior year's first quarter. Translation reduced sales by 2%. Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 2%, Europe sales were flat, Japan was down 3% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 5%.", "On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales decreased by 9%, and recurring revenues grew by 7% this quarter. Within our TA instruments division, sales increased by 10% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q1 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in as expected at 60.2% comparable to Q1 last year. SG&A expenses were flat this quarter, and R&D expenses increased by 5%.", "Our effective operating income tax rate came in as anticipated at about 16%. Net interest expense was $5.7 million, and share count came in at 90.3 million shares, 3 million shares lower than Q1 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1,353,000,000, and debt totaled $1,024,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of $329 million. As for share repurchases, we bought 695,000 shares of our common stock or $62 million this quarter. This leaves $124 million remaining on the current authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less the capital expenditures plus any non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting, excluding unusual non-recurring items. For Q1, free cash flow came in at $100 million after funding $16 million of CapEx and adding back $6 million of non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation. ", "Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 76 days this quarter, up 2 days from Q1 last year. And inventories increased by $20 million this quarter, as is typical for the first quarter of the year.", "Overall, we had a slow start for 2012, but we do not see Q1 as being indicative of our full year performance. As we now think about the remainder of 2012, we expect to see improvements in the majority of our markets around the world and better momentum in large pharma accounts as capital budgets continue to be released. Just to the prior guidance, we do expect to see continued pockets of weakness in our government and academic segment as the year plays out given the budgetary pressures many countries are facing, particularly in Western Europe. ", "For the remaining quarters of the year then, we continue to believe that the improvements that I just mentioned, coupled with a more favorable quarterly base and comparison, will provide for 5% to 7% quarterly growth before currency effects for these next 3 quarters. For the full year, this could result in sales growth, pre-currency, of 4% to 6%. Currency at today's levels is expected to reduce full year sales growth by 2%. Full year reported sales growth would then be between 2% and 4%.", "Moving down the P&L. Gross margins are expected to be flat with 2011 at about 60.5%. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate less than sales growth as we continue to manage our operating expenses judiciously. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to be about 16%.", "Our fully diluted average share count is likely to be around 89.5 million shares outstanding. And when rolling all of this together, we currently expect 2012 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in a range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share.", "As we think about our expectations for the second quarter of 2012, we expect organic sales growth of about 5% to 7%. Currency translation at today's rates will reduce sales by 2%, resulting in reported sales growth of about 3% to 5%. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. ", "Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. I think at this point, we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Doug, I guess I'll start with a question around the pharma spending, because that seems to be the biggest surprise this quarter. I think India was somewhat expected. But what was the reason behind the pullback by these large pharma customers? And did it come as a surprise to you pretty much late in the quarter? Or were there leading indicators that you sort of looked at that pointed to some kind of weakness in the quarter? And then what are you looking at on a forward-looking basis?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think it's fair to say it was somewhat surprising to us in the same way maybe that the fourth quarter was a little stronger than we originally expected. The out of the chute momentum that we thought would improve as we went through the quarter didn't materialize in the first quarter. Now we've clearly, at this point, autopsied a lot of the particular regions, a lot of the large accounts. We believe we've got good reason to believe that this is a delay and not a permanent delay, and we've got some pretty good evidence of orders moving through the pipeline earlier on in the second quarter. So we've -- it's fair to say that in prior years, at times we've seen delays in capital at big pharma. This was a more significant delay than we've typically seen in the year. But I should say that it's probably split kind of evenly from the big pharma dynamic and the developing market. It's true that we didn't expect India to go gangbusters out of the chute as we weighted the beginning of the fiscal year, but it was a much steeper slowdown in India than we expected.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just a quick follow-up on the reasons behind the pharma weakness. Could there be a competitive dynamic going on there? I just wanted to clarify that.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think it's always dangerous to look at significant share dynamics on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Clearly we've done that. You could have said, \"Well, gee, they gained share in the fourth quarter, and something happened in the first quarter.\" We don't think that's happening. You always have some competitive losses and some competitive wins. We think that this is a market dynamic and not a competitive dynamic. We'll continue to monitor that, but we haven't seen any product introductions or customer losses that work against us. So it's fair to keep our eyes open on that, Nandita, but I can't say that we're seen much evidence of it at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Just 2 quick ones for me, Doug. I guess first, I know you typically don't talk in terms of orders, but one of your peers, actually just the other day, mentioned very similar dynamics to what you talked about in terms of end markets on the mass spec side. And then just -- but they mentioned that throughout the quarter, orders kind of continually improved. So can you maybe just talk about your order growth rates, in particular in maybe countries like India and some of the weaker areas? And the second is kind of a follow-up maybe for John. If you think about your guidance, can you maybe split your consumable outlook versus your instrument outlook? It seems like consumables were fairly strong this quarter. It was obviously offset by pretty weak instruments.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure, Jon. I think there's a good reason for being careful about orders rate dynamics, because orders don't have the same dynamic that sales do and orders can be canceled, and order patterns can differ dramatically from sales pattern. I do think it is a qualitative measure that can be useful, and I think it is fair to share that our order rate growth was better than our sales dynamic this quarter. So I mean that's a fact that I think is a fair one to share. And the first quarter of last year, you'll recall we had some large mass spec shipments that came out of backlog, so that had an impact on us. But it's also fair to say that our orders came in softer than we expected, and I think the dynamic of the slow release in big pharma is a fair one to keep in mind. We think that'll begin to catch up, and we'll continue to monitor that closely. The second part of your...", "John A. Ornell", "The second was just a question on splitting out the guidance between recurring revenues and instrumentation. And on that one, Jon, we're pretty confident that our recurring revenues will retain about that 7% rate you saw in the first quarter. And then instruments are likely to be the variable that, for the next 3 quarters, would bring us down to the lower end of the range, which is 5%. So instruments by themselves could be 4% to 6%, something in that range, with recurring getting closer to 7% for the next 3 quarters is what's incorporated in our guidance.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So John, do you think -- the reason I was asking, do you think the extra day had much of an impact on the consumable or the recurring revenues in the first quarter?", "John A. Ornell", "No, I don't. I think that, de minimis, it wouldn't even have been 1%. So I think the 7% growth is -- there was a little bit of a base comparison on the chemistry side. Service was very strong. We're pretty confident we're going to see above that rate as we go across the next 3 quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "A quick question on your emerging market commentary, your developing market commentary. How sensitive do you think your business would be in China due to the lower-than-expected GDP growth over there?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Dan, it's a fair question. I think most of the attention is on bigger projects, infrastructure projects. I think as we continue to probe this matter and look at laboratory spending and life science spending, it's not likely to be the first target or a major target of budgetary slowdowns in China. Now of course, if a major reduction happens, it probably drops all boats a little bit, but we're not seeing it at this point.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my follow-up, can you give us an update on the attached rate on your UPLC instruments?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. You want to -- in terms of the chemistry?", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "ACQUITY chemistry that goes along with...", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. It appears to be in about the 80% range at this time. It was higher in the beginning as we introduced the H-Class. That particular technology, unlike the original introduction, enables the customer to utilize conventional LC columns which, in fact, can be a broader base of manufacturers' columns. But in terms of UPLC utilization, the column attach rate for UPLC columns specifically remains very high because of their performance.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just on the large pharma customers, just, Doug and John, what are you hearing from these customers that -- why they discussed the slow release this year? Is it the uncertain economy? Is there anything new on just kind of R&D? Is there -- just kind of wondering for maybe some color, if you can provide it, about what gives you confidence that the slow release is going to open up.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Boy, it's a fairly broad-based dynamic. So I mean it's one of the things that makes us believe that it's not really a competitive dynamic. It's both Western Europe and the United States. They're pretty much across the board. Particularly, as we've gone back more deeply into these accounts as we've started into the second quarter, it's telling how emphatic most of these accounts are about their intention to buy during the rest of the year. I mean, that's why as we've probed, did we lose big orders? Did somebody else penetrate into these accounts? We can't find that dynamic. We can find a lot of complaining about delays in laboratories being able to get their request through their systems and their continuing desire to buy our products. So that part is confident, but the part that's sometimes difficult to call is when will it release. That's why we think we have seen some kind of a leakage coming in that release process, but it's way too early to declare victory that this just was a one-quarter dynamic. We'll continue to monitor this pretty closely.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, sort of related to that. So it sounds like the customers themselves aren't indicating that kind of budgets are going to come in below original expectations. They're kind of maintaining their overall budget outlook, but expecting it to tick up. And then maybe related to that, what are you -- what were you basing your pharma end market? Or what were you assuming for the pharma end market to grow at this year for Waters prior to today? And what do you think it grows at now for 2012?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Mid-single digits.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And in terms of the budgets, have they indicated that actually budgets will decline from original [indiscernible]?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think what we have seen indicated -- now this isn't an algebraic formula that you can point to. But we continue to believe that's consistent with what big pharma is intending. That's certainly what the people down the ladder in pharmaceutical QC and development labs believe. Now sometimes, they're out of step with what their top management, but so far, our triangulation suggests that that's still a reasonable outlook for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Knight with CLSA.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "In the other parts of Asia such as China, particularly Japan, could you talk about the -- do you see any recovery from the tsunami in that marketplace?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I would say what we -- Japan's, with a few exceptions, has been a kind of stable, very low-growth territory for a number of years now. I think -- and this quarter, we had a particularly tough comparison largely because of some backlog dynamics in Japan last year. I'd say we're still seeing kind of the same basic level of momentum. Maybe a little bit of infrastructure spend in Japan has kind of gone away from the life science laboratory towards basic infrastructure rebuild. We hear stories like that that's largely -- no, you can't point to government statistics so much, but I believe some of that's gone on in the last 6 months or so. So if that's true, I think we'll begin to see a little bit of performance improvement coming out of Japan as we go forward.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then what color or what should we be watching regarding the currencies, the franc, the yen, the dollar relationship? Any hedging or actions you've taken to reduce that volatility or risk this year?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "No. I mean, traditionally, for a lot of reasons that we've talked about in the past, the notion of hedging forward your currency sales risk just doesn't particularly work in this industry. The yen has weakened a little bit against the dollar in the past 3 to 4 months; was in the high 70s, now it's in the low 80s, seems to be stable around that low 80s level. And the euro has been -- it got as low as the mid 1.20s. It's now in the low 1.30s. It bounces around there a little bit. That's the level that we're anticipating for the rest of the year. That's as good a forecast, I suppose, as you can make at this point, Paul.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai of Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So Doug, on the call, you mentioned that the H-Class and Xevo did well. So as you kind of parse through the Q1 results, I mean, was some of the budgetary issues with big pharma more on the -- for lack of a better word, more routine? Or are the older instruments in an upgrade cycle just kind of delayed out?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, there are 2 things I'd say, Quintin. The earlier stage parts of R&D suffered the most. So that's discovery and the higher end mass specs, and then the Alliance aligned particularly with generics were the 2 major dynamics that we see in the pharma world.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then with respect to India, Doug, is there -- are you really looking at that region about maybe how you go to market there and maybe pricing more of your instruments in local currency to take out some of the volatility in demand?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Frankly, no, Quintin. I think we don't see any real competitive dynamic here that's changing the thrust. I think almost everything going on in India is related to internal struggles and the rupee, but we're not going to price in India really differently than we prize anywhere else. The end market pricing in India is about the same as we're seeing everywhere else in our international world, and we don't think that pricing is going to dramatically change our end market performance. This is something we got to work through. We have an excellent position. We have very high market share in India. We got to get through the local dynamics on the regulatory burdens and the CRO and then new product this year, the new product development issues that they're experiencing in India. We think we see some of that coming. I think it's probably going to take into the second half of the year before we see any kind of return to normalcy in India.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMC.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A number of my questions have been answered, but maybe just one starting off on kind of your cost structure. I mean, you've always talked about your ability to pull levers if needed. At this stage in the year, I mean, do you have any updated thoughts on cost structure heading into the rest of the year in light of this first quarter coming in a bit below expectations?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'll let John embroider a little bit here, but I mean you can see that our SG&A spending was flat in the quarter. We didn't dramatically adopt any plans to restructure our results because at this point, we don't think that we're seeing a long-term significant reduction in demand. We'll continue to monitor that, Tycho, and if we change that belief, we'll have to look at our cost structures. But I think you can tell that within the relevant range, we haven't exploded our cost structure. And as a result, if we're right about a return to normal levels of demand, then we'll be able to leverage that uptick in demand to pretty good earnings results.", "John A. Ornell", "We also typically back-end load investment spending in new headcount and the like and obviously, we didn't do much of any of that in the first quarter and we're going to lag that out a bit too in the second quarter until we're comfortable that we're on track. So we kind of naturally in our budget cycle have that kind of capability to keep at bay those investments until we're comfortable that it's time to spend.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then maybe a question on Europe. I mean, I think you said that that was flat. One of your peers that had reported on mass spec numbers had talked about that being particularly soft. Can you just talk about your visibility into Europe and in light of the broader pharma commentary you provided, but also how you think about Europe over the next couple of quarters?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I'd say Europe and U.S. were -- overall, had similar dynamics. It was similar disappointment in the output of the large pharma. I mean, Europe is probably a little bit more weighted to large pharma, and we clearly -- we anticipated soft governmental spending. We certainly saw that. I guess the -- and we've certainly seen the weakest conditions in Southern Europe, which had the most macroeconomic issues. And I guess other than that, I don't think that there's anything -- I'd say the weakness in the government academic segment affects the high-end mass spec and we certainly saw that, because that's -- much of that is government-funded initiatives. So I'd say we are not anticipating that to change too much. We do think the pharma segment should improve as we go through the year.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then maybe just last one on pharma again. You -- I think you talked about it, an assumption for mid-single-digit growth there, and we're just trying to kind of understand what's behind that. I mean, if you kind of look at the aggregate pharma R&D budgets, they're flat to probably down over the next couple of years. So what gives you conviction that you can kind of -- that you can outgrow that market? Is it share shift? Is it new product cycles? Is it kind of continued conversion of ACQUITY?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. When we look at our pharma business, Tycho, it's about 60% of our business, broadly defined. The large pharma portion of it is about -- well, it's under 10% this quarter, but it's typically 11%, 12%, and that group typically lags the overall segment that we talked about growing mid single digit. So the expectation for large pharma within that overall segment is a few points less or more than the average. So it's a low single-digit growth expectation for these top accounts. I mean, they were down double digit in the first quarter, causing the issue that we're looking at, and we're confident that that's not going to continue at that rate for the remainder of the year. But it's really the generics. It's the Biotech. It's the CROs that grow more quickly than the average that we think will come back and provide an overall growth that's mid-single digit. It won't be large pharma that's going to drive us to that mid-single-digit rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Clearly, you've talked a bit about what makes you feel better about the outlook moving forward. You've also mentioned, in response to a few earlier questions, that Q4 was a bit stronger than you expected and clearly, Q1 was a bit weaker. So taking this a step further, if we continue to look backwards, are there signs that maybe Q4 may have benefited a bit at the expense of Q1? And related to that, if we go back and look at your pharma growth for last year by quarter, I think sequentially, you did 20% year-over-year, 13%, 10% and 6% or something in that ballpark. Clearly, most of those figures are well above the historical norms. So you did talk a lot about delays in pharma capital budget releases, but is there a chance you guys were just overly aggressive in your internal forecast relative to what is a pretty difficult comp?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Go ahead, John.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I think as we look at the quarters of the year, there's no doubt that we have historically seen a fair amount of seasonality, and we have historically pointed out that Q1 and Q4 are always the most difficult quarters to forecast. In the fourth quarter you've got the capital spend, an elusive mentality where you're waiting for the big push at the end of the year for people to spend their CapEx budgets. And then at the start of the year, they have to re-up that capital budget. And some of them get released early in the year. Some of them get released into the second quarter. So the first quarter and the fourth quarter for us was -- particularly with large pharma, was always a little bit difficult to forecast. And we -- I don't necessarily look at this and say that there was a trend developing across last year for which Q1 is a point on any line. I see it as a point off the line. It's -- it is true that in Q1 last year, we came out of the gate very strong. There was spending very early on from a lot of pharmaceutical accounts. I think they felt better about the business or better about the business environment just generally. So the basic comparison was difficult. We thought we had that accommodated in a lower expectation for the first quarter than for the full year, but we did not foresee a significant number of large pharma accounts really spending almost nothing on capital to start the year, which is where Q1 landed.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. I guess on the other topic du jour, India, this is -- this rupee devaluation issue is now a multi-quarter phenomena. Given that plans for purchases accordingly have, in some cases, been delayed for a few quarters, is it fair to conclude that there is a bolus of demand that should be worked through in early Q2 with the budgets being reset? And are you seeing this already?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We believe that. We think we see some sign of that, Doug, but it's -- I'm going to be very careful, because I thought we'd see a little of that in the first quarter, and we didn't. If anything, we didn't. Now you've got multiple issues facing the Indians, including some relatively newly arising regulatory issues with their ability to export into the U.S. That may be making them a bit more conservative in how they look at near-term spending too. We think that's not going to change the ultimate view of India and the likelihood that the investments have to be made in order to keep up with the generic drug demand, but it might take a little bit longer than I'd otherwise like.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could sneak in one last operational question. As you noted, SG&A, I believe, was flat year-over-year. Is this largely just a function of the weaker-than-expected instrument contribution in the quarter? And if so, how much higher would this have been if you had hit your guidance? And is this the right -- what's the right way to think about this moving forward?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I'd say that the biggest reason why Q1 was flat was because of lower sales associated with less commission, less cost on that front. We've talked about SG&A growing 1 point or 2 less than sales growth. I would say that we look like we're on track to continue to be able to assume that. But I would say that -- I mean, there are natural variable spend in the business that ratchets up and down with the sales line and largely, that's what you saw in the first quarter.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "If I -- as John has said before, we were careful coming into the year. We typically are, maybe we're even a little bit more careful in spending on headcount. So we were -- we're not adding heads anticipating that we would see how this year began to spend itself out. And I -- we're prudent in that, and we'll continue to be prudent.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Doug, I'm just trying to wrestle with the inherent uncertainty in budgets with your commentary that you are seeing evidence of the orders moving through, the ones that obviously didn't come through in the first quarter. Can you expand on this comment that you have evidence that orders are pulling through? Talk a little bit about the size of those orders. And do they make up for the miss in the first quarter?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I mean, I should say that what we are seeing is both the placement of some orders and the -- perhaps more confidence on the part of the customers that we're dealing with that those orders are progressing down their internal cycle at a more pronounced pace. So I wouldn't say it's all related to actually hard copy orders that we have in hand, but a lot of these customers had told us that they were placing orders in February and March, of course. I mean, we -- it was just not a dream that we had that this business was coming. They fully expected to get their budgets cleared. They fully expected to place them. And in many cases they'd say, \"The order's in purchasing. I can't get it out of purchasing.\" Now those things are beginning to move in a faster clip down that process, particularly in a number of these large pharmas that we have good relationships with. So I'd say we -- clearly, some of those large orders that we were tracking and expected to get in the first quarter have now started rolling in on the second quarter, and that evidence makes us feel better.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "From a size perspective though, like, enough to offset what happened in the first quarter? Or can you maybe just have that?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think it's just fair to say it's early on in the quarter. Three weeks does not a quarter make. It's a good sign, but it certainly is no way to say that we've got the quarter in hand. So it's a good fact, and it's a positive fact that we didn't have 1.5 months, 2 months ago. So that's all I'm willing to say. It's no guarantee, but it's a good fact.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then my follow-up is just on the trend of R&D rationalization. You've talked about that in the past as something that has been ongoing. How are you viewing pharma companies rationalizing R&D spending going forward? What's your underlying assumption of how that impacts this end market?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think it's been a continuing trend for a lot of years. I don't think that what we're seeing in the early part of this year is a dramatic change from kind of what we saw in 2011. You're continuing to see more emphasis on outsourcing, continuing to see these companies work with -- moving clinical trials into areas like India and Eastern Europe. And you're continuing to see a shift in influence from small molecule drugs to biopharmaceuticals, and we think that that shift to biopharmaceuticals is richer in our kinds of technology than small molecular weight dynamic. So we don't see that changing. You can't find a big pharma that doesn't lead any of these discussions with the fact that in the near term, most of their influence is on biopharmaceuticals.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Can you offer any context on the acquisition contribution? I know you did 2 small deals; 1 late last year, 1 early this year. What does that contribute to the first quarter as well as the year in terms of sales?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. It was -- it rounded to nothing. It was a few points of the TA growth. So there was -- TA, we said, grew at 10% with -- before currency. It would have been about 7% without the acquisition, but it's de minimis on a full company basis.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So less than 50 basis points for the year?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Less than 50.", "John A. Ornell", "For the quarter.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "And the year.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. What about the year?", "John A. Ornell", "And for the year, too. For the year, yes.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I mean, we continue to look at doing other things of this nature, but it's hard to imagine that it would be getting much more significant than that for the year.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then can you offer, Doug, just an updated view geographically for 2012, U.S., Europe and then Japan and Asia, outside Japan? Just give us where your guidance is now set kind of from a geographic perspective.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Let's see. Yes. John maybe...", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I could get that. For the rest of the year, we're looking at a growth that's 5% to 7%. We're looking for the developing areas of the world to improve and to be kind of at the higher end of that, kind of a high single-digit expectation for the developing world. So that would include China, that would include Latin America, Eastern Europe to grow in the low single digits, being dragged down throughout the year through issues and pressures on the government side of business there. We're looking for the U.S. to be about a mid single-digit growth rate for the remainder of the year and Japan kind of a low to mid, depending on basic comparison.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then it's safe to say that the disappointment here is pharma related, right? So if you look at your applied industrial, and I guess I would include chemical, has anything changed in your view on that set of end markets for the year?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'd say we -- you heard us talk about our belief that pharma's going to improve. So I think we've talked enough about that. The industrial chemical and the applied markets have performed well, and we expect those to continue to perform well. So I think certainly on the industrial side, both Waters and TA have broad evidence that, that should continue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The first question I wanted to ask, I just -- you spent a lot of time talking about the macro end market drivers of the quarter miss there. And I wanted to maybe isolate and be just specific about asking about any large orders from specific customers within pharma that might have caused disruption. Was there -- is it fair to say that it wasn't isolated to any handful of large orders?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "That's correct, Isaac.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just secondly, if I look at sort of the components of the growth this quarter, you had organic growth. You had growth in the consumable side of I think 7%, and then I think you said the instrumentation side was down about 9%. As you look at the orders growing a little faster than sales this quarter, is it fair to say that we'll see a reversion to the mean, so to speak, between those 2 components of the business?", "John A. Ornell", "That's the expectation, yes.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you. And thank you, all, for being with us. We look forward to talking, hopefully with better results, at the end of the second quarter. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation.

With me on today's call is John Ornell, the Waters Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters division; and Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "As is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter's results, and John will follow with details of our financials and provide you with our outlook for the third quarter of 2012 and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John A. Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q3 and full year 2012. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, in part one under the caption Business Risks, factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement result except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2012.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to our company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer you to pro forma results, which is excluding impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income for Diluted Share, included in this morning's press release. Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well, overall the second quarter's organic results were close to our original estimates, but they do suggest that we have a need for a moderately higher level of caution, as we look into the second half of 2012.", "The second quarter started up positively for us, as most orders that we had identified as delayed in the first quarter were booked in April and as business momentum initially improved in India with the issuance of new capital budgets.", "In May, we had a strong presence at ASMS, where our new products were well received and where we felt encouraged that demand for research-focused instrumentation might hold up better than expected, this despite heavily publicized concerns that academic and government budgets were under pressure.", "On the other hand, as the quarter unfolded, we began to see general economic conditions weaken in Europe and in some Asian countries. The value of the euro and the rupee fell from levels that we saw in April. And it seems as if the approval processes for instrument purchases in nearly all of our larger accounts were dragging on a little longer than anticipated. In general, a greater level of conservatism was marginally impacting demand across almost all of our end markets.", "Consequently, our orders and shipments in the second quarter came in a little lighter than we had hoped, and our current outlook for sales growth in the remainder of the year is accordingly tempered to account for market uncertainties.", "Fortunately, we ended the quarter with a conservative spending plan and throughout the quarter, tightly controlled our spending while maintaining disciplined pricing policies. Flexibility of our business model allowed us to deliver operating leverage despite a foreign exchange headwind and lower-than-anticipated shipment volume.", "All in, we managed to deliver adjusted 8% EPS growth on sales that grew organically at about 4.5% and at 1% after foreign currency translation.", "For the Waters division and geographically, Asian markets outside of China and Japan were weaker than we had expected, as industrial, chemical and applied market segments declined in the quarter.", "Shipments in India were slightly down year-over-year, as ordering delays seem to materialize with the weakening of the local currency. Our business in China held up well with sales up in the double-digit rate in the quarter and with all major customer segments delivering consistent growth. Developing markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America also were under pressure during the quarter and adversely impacted the division's overall sales growth. In these regions, nonlife science applications were most negatively affected.", "Our business in the U.S. held up well in the quarter, as strong pharmaceutical, governmental and academic sales offset weakening demand from chemical segment. Pharmaceutical instrument sales benefited from continued strong uptake of ACQUITY H-Class, while the nonprofit end market growth can be attributed to research mass spec shipments.", "Pharmaceutical segment sales in Western Europe were also fairly strong, although government and academic spending was under pressure. All in and despite all the negative news coming out of Europe, the outlook there may not be so grim for the second half of the year given Waters' exposure to the more stable pharmaceutical base.", "Waters division constant currency sales in Japan were about flat in the quarter, with strong pharmaceutical sales offset by weak chemical analysis results, a recurring theme as we look at our business geographically.", "Looking more closely at pharmaceutical sales, outside of India, most regions experienced robust growth in the quarter with sales in the U.S., Japan, Europe and China all contributing at levels above the company's overall growth rate. As we've seen in recent quarters, the lion's share of increased sales was from specialty, generic and CROs and not from our larger accounts.", "For our largest pharmaceutical customers, we did see sequential as well as year-over-year sales growth. However, just about all of this growth can be attributed to business that moved from the first into the second quarter's results.", "And speaking with these customers, we know that some planned spending has been pushed to the second half but also feel recent announcements concerning the relocation of major research facilities accompanied by continuing project streamlining programs may further hamper growth at certain large accounts.", "Combination of government and university shipments grew moderately for this division. The growth was geographically variable, with the U.S. and Asia posting double-digit increases, Japan flattish and most of the rest of the world, significant declines.", "As I had mentioned earlier, high-end mass spec sales significantly account for the positive results in the U.S., where both government and academic labs delivered strong performance.", "While we remain cautious on the sustainability of growth from nonprofit customers, we remain encouraged by researchers' responses to new instrument offerings that we introduced at ASMS.", "Looking outside our life science end markets and for the Waters division, I think it's interesting to note that following the deep recession we all experienced in late 2008 and through 2009, sales growth from our industrial, chemical and applied markets generally have been accretive to our quarterly and full year results. However, this trend changed in the second quarter of this year, and with the exception of our business in China, most regions saw declines.", "The applied markets, namely the combination of food and environmental customer sets, have always been somewhat lumpy and have enjoyed surges in growth when new regulations were passed or when an unfortunate contamination issue surfaced. We saw that during the baby formula issue in China a couple of years ago.", "In the second quarter, these applied markets were weaker, and at this point, we feel that it's a temporary pause in growth, as we continue to be very optimistic about both the market potential and in our competitive position in these areas.", "We are a little more concerned about the negative growth that the Waters division saw for industrial chemical customers, as we feel that this trend is indicative of lower spending in anticipation of deepening global economic instability and may continue to dilute Waters revenue growth until a clearer pathway toward a sustainable economic recovery becomes more apparent.", "The stronger second quarter performance that we saw for this segment from our TA Instruments group is somewhat encouraging. However, they, too, may experience more pressure during the second half of the year.", "Looking a little more closely at TA Instruments, the division continued to deliver superb results, delivering double-digit constant currency growth in the quarter. High temperature applications based on the division's more recent acquisitions contributed nicely in the quarter as did the division's biocalorimetry offerings. Geographically, TA saw a relatively balanced growth.", "Turning back to the Waters division and looking at product line trends. H-Class ACQUITY UPLC and Xevo tandem quadrupole based systems, especially our ultrasensitive Xevo TQ-S, continue to drive instrument systems growth. During the quarter, UPLC MS/MS system sales for food safety and environmental applications declined against top prior year comparisons.", "In addition, a combination of competitive pressure as well as the ASMS introduction of our new high-performance Xevo QTof G2-S, a system that will begin shipping in volume in the third quarter, resulted in the quarterly decline for high-end MS system sales.", "We are encouraged by the ASMS customer reception and subsequent positive responses to recent demonstrations of our newly introduced Xevo QTof G2-S and our UNIFI-based UPLC MS/MS solutions and feel that delivery of these new systems in the second half of this year will help accelerate our growth.", "In addition, our newly introduced and award winning UPC 2 System began shipping in the second quarter, and business momentum is building for this high performance and exclusively Waters instrument technology.", "Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew organically at a 5% rate in the quarter. A slight sequential decline in recurring revenue growth in the quarter can largely be attributed to slower chemistry sales in developing markets, a trend that we expect may correct in the second half of this year.", "Before turning you over to John, I want to view our first half's performance in a slightly broader context. Sequentially, we saw a rather typical increase in our second quarter sales volume. As in prior times of economic uncertainty, we benefited from the more consistent performance of our recurring revenue lines and from our ability to modulate our expenses in response to challenging end market conditions.", "Our current customer base is, by most measures, more diverse than it has ever been and provides us with a better buffer against select geographic, competitive or customer-specific challenges than we have historically enjoyed.", "Better than hedged [ph] , we remain very confident with our product portfolio and with our competitive position. In fact, we remain comfortable in our ability to weather a severe downturn and believe we are well positioned to benefit from any acceleration in customer demand.", "Going to show you that we'll be conservative as we manage expenses, but we also plan to continuously invest in product development and customer support programs to drive our technologically focused strategy. I think it's a strategy that differentiates Waters from other companies and one that has a demonstrated record of success.", "Now I'd like to turn you over to John with further details on our financials and our future outlook.", "John A. Ornell", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Second quarter sales increased by 1%, and Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 8% at $1.17 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.08 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.09 this quarter versus $1.07 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.", "Reviewing Q2 sales results in comparison to Q2 last year. Before currency translation, sales were up about 4.5% from prior year's second quarter. Translation reduced sales by about 3%. Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 7%. Europe sales were flat. Japan was down 1%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 7%.", "On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 2%, and recurring revenues grew by 5% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 11% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q2 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in as expected at 60.7%, comparable to Q2 last year. SG&A expenses were lower than anticipated this quarter and were down 3% overall. Operationally, we restrained spending in light of the more difficult economic conditions we saw earlier this year, and foreign currency translation reduced SG&A by 3% this quarter. For the second half of the year, we expect SG&A to be about flat with prior year.", "R&D expenses increased by 4% this quarter, as we continued to invest in product advancements to support future sales growth. Our effective operating income tax rate came in as anticipated at about 16%.", "Net interest expense was $5.8 million, and share count came in at 89.4 million shares, 3.9 million shares lower than Q2 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1,392,000,000, and debt totaled $1,101,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of about $291 million. As for share repurchases, we bought 1,260,000 shares of our common stock for $103 million. This leaves $770 million remaining on current authorized share repurchase programs.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.", "For Q2, free cash flow came in at $90 million after funding $18 million of CapEx. Excluded from this calculation is $30 million of capital spending related to the consolidation of our mass spectrometry facilities in the U.K. and $3 million of litigation payment.", "Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 72 days this quarter, down 2 days from Q2 last year. And inventories increased by just $4 million this quarter.", "So overall, 2012 got off to a slow start in the first quarter and improved modestly in the second quarter, but business momentum remains below the level we had anticipated. As we now think about the remainder of 2012, we expect to see this somewhat more difficult economic environment continuing to affect our customers' willingness to deploy capital. We are therefore taking a more cautious view of the remainder of the year and now expect sales growth before foreign currency effects of 2% to 4% in the second half of 2012. Currency at today's levels would reduce sales by about 4% in Q3 and 3% in Q4, resulting in relatively flat sales in the second half of 2012. For full year 2012 then, sales growth before foreign currency translation would be between 2% and 3%. Negative foreign currency translation of about 3% is expected to push sales down to just under flat with 2011.", "Moving down the P&L. Gross margins are expected to be about flat with 2011 at about 60.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be about flat with 2011 as a result of tight operational controls on spending across the year and the beneficial effects of foreign currency translation. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $23 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to be about 16%. Our fully diluted share count for 2012 is likely to be around 89 million shares outstanding. Rolling all of this together, we currently expect 2012 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5 per share.", "As we think about our expectations for the third quarter of 2012, we expect organic sales growth of about 2% to 4%. Currency translation at today's rates would reduce sales by about 4%, resulting in reported sales flat to down 2% in Q3. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in a range of $1.16 to $1.21 in the third quarter. Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. And operator, at this point, I think we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "As we think about your second half guidance, could you just maybe put a little more details around how you're thinking about growth from your different end markets and/or geographies given the lower top line? Just want to think about like where you see the biggest contraction versus what you were thinking before.", "John A. Ornell", "Sure, sure. I'll go through that. From a geographical perspective, Dan, we're thinking about that U.S. being kind of a mid-single-digit growth driver for the business as we move through the back half of the year. Europe and Japan are kind of flat, as we think about continued pressures in Europe remaining and no sign of anything getting much better there as we think about Q3 and Q4. Asia on the other hand, I'd say, we continue to look at the kind of high-single-digit type of an expectation for that part of the world and a little bit more conservative view of ROW of places like Latin America and other areas that had been growing closer to double digits, we're now thinking might be closer to mid-single digits. So all of that pulls the growth down to something that gets somewhere between 2% and 4%.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And when you think about after the first quarter guidance reduction given was timing related with pharma, and you guys thought you had caught, obviously, enough vote [ph] , lower numbers enough to reflect the issues that you had seen and built an even a cushion, now we're coming down again. What's your level of confidence -- just kind of how -- can you give us any more kind of feeling for the level of conservatism that you feel this new guidance incorporates?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, we try to put us and you kind of in the middle of a range of possible outcomes. I'd say, we've been challenged to achieve the middle of the range, even though we set out each quarter thinking that's where we are. This past quarter was very challenging, and as we look forward, even though our field continues to be optimistic, the data we're getting back at ground level concerning the field interactions with their customers suggest that they really have demands, I think, as that gets translated up the hierarchy though, clearly, management controls and our customer set in terms of available spending has tempered what we think is a reasonably robust level of demand at the ground level. So as we look out into second half and have taken our expectations down a notch, we don't think that the second half gets materially worse, but we don't see a lot of signs that there's a particular factor that's going to create an uptick. So we think we're a little bit on the conservative side as we look at the second half, but I'd freely admit that it's a challenging environment, and we're still keeping a very tight handle on the spending lever.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "If I can just sneak one more in, just on the OpEx control, the SG&A flat in the second half of the year. What would -- what is that level of spending outlook necessitate? Is that within the normal course of business? Or is there a onetime kind of a  headcount reductions that are occurring and how much more control do you have to bring that down further if things turn out to be weaker than expected?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "There's nothing extraordinary or restructuring in that, Dan. It's tight control on unnecessary travel. It's some natural in terms of commission and variable pay won't be as originally anticipated given the lower sales levels. It certainly --  headcount additions are unlikely in this environment. So all of the things that -- in every year, we keep a number of plans -- planned incremental spending in reserve until we see some of our planned growth come together, and as it hasn't, we're putting those increased plans in abeyance. So I'd say it's certainly an uptick in the level of control of spending and the deferral of things that aren't directly necessary to create sales, but it's not anything extraordinary in terms of restructuring. If we see a significant change in our expectations, we would, of course, look at what we needed to do to keep our P&L structure in balance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So look, I'm interested on sort of the pacing in quarter in terms of the demand flow-through. What we've seen in sort of our survey data and anecdotally heard, at least in the industrial exposed and applied exposed customer basis was the trend into June significantly sort of deteriorated and that sort of continued into July. And we've also seen that in sort of the macro PMI data. I guess, what's your assumption for sort of the trajectory? It seems like at least on the industrial side, you're looking for the deterioration to sort of moderate. I guess, is that being confirmed by sort of the order rates you're seeing or the anecdotal things you're hearing from customers? And then I want to turn to sort of the pharma side.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, Ross, I would say we didn't really see quite that inflection point in the quarter. I'd say maybe some weakening as we went through, but the industrial segment of our business was...", "John A. Ornell", "Lackluster.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, lackluster throughout. And I'd say in our outlook for the second half, we certainly don't anticipate it getting much better, but we don't see it dropping off a cliff. Now part of that specific to us, we're getting a very good reception to our UPC 2 System introduction, and that's  having particularly raising eyebrows in certain industrial markets because of its applications there. So we might have a specific circumstance that helps us in those markets that haven't been there in the past. Was there a second question?", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And turning maybe to the pharma aside. I mean, it seems like most of the growth is coming from sort of specialty, generics, CRO customers. Given sort of the weakness we've seen in emerging markets, I mean how -- versus sort of the last time we saw a deterioration in those markets, say, I guess that was probably '08, how would you expect just the pacing of moderation of growth there to occur or are you not assuming it will? And then on the in -- traditional pharma aside in terms of the larger folks, what do you think is sort of the crux of sort of the slowdown there? I mean I would have thought, given the commentary we've heard in the pharma so for this year, demand would be actually a bit better, and maybe that's encouraging, but I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of what you think the key driver there is on the large pharma side?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "On the large pharma front, I think it's very lumpy and largely specific to individual accounts. We saw a pretty good results in large pharma in Europe and decent results in the United States. We saw growth in those large accounts, but it certainly wasn't anything that we'd call robust. The greater part of our growth story in the broad pharmaceutical market is in specialty pharma biotech, CROs and generics. But generics was certainly tempered by India, and India, there's no question that the weakness in the rupee is causing consternation amongst those account. I continue to believe that, that will get better. I don't think that there's a way for those businesses to delay spending forever, and we saw a little bit of a pickup. As we ended the second quarter there, we saw a particularly good pickup in underlying demand, but some of those accounts really faced issues in clearing letters of credit and getting their banks to release credit. So I think they're all working on that, and I anticipate that India is going to get better over the next 2 or 3 quarters. And that's basically hurt our growth rate in that area in the first half of this year. So our outlook just at big pharma stays pretty much in the route that it's in. We have some accounts spending robustly, but that's not true across the board. We think CRO spending is likely to pick up from somewhat restrained levels in the first half, and the net-net of that is maybe a little bit better in the future than we've seen in the immediate past.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "One last quick one. John, anything in the forecast for sort of the fiscal cliff/sequester in terms of any assumption of different purchasing in the U.S.?", "John A. Ornell", "No. I'd say that this point in time at least, we're not getting feedback from our customers that would suggest that, that event is something that's going to strike us between now and the end of the year. And I suppose that could change, but certainly to date, we haven't been giving any indication that, that's going to be a meaningful event.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Doug, I wanted to begin with a question around consumables and sort of attach rate on the H-Class installed base that you've built out on the QA/QC side. How does that look? And how much of a driver of growth has it been thus far? And what can we look for in the future?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "The attach rate on the UPLC overall, Nandita, has been very good. The -- it is fair to say that with the H-Class, there's still a lot of applications being run there that are HPLC and not UPLC. That's one of the big attractions of H-Class. So the attach rate of UPLC columns on the H-Class isn't as high as it is on classical UPLC and things like the X-class -- excuse me, the I-Class. So overall, it is our fastest-growing consumables category. And I'd say we're seeing no real diminishment of the attach rates where we expect to. Over the longer haul, we're expecting H-Class to garner a greater share of UPLC consumables, and that's generally been happening since we've introduced the H-Class.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. But fair to assume that customers now put off sort of the HPLC to UPLC switch for a longer period of time at least while the macro is weaker and the uncertainty persists?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'd say it's a mixed bag. In certain cases, it's -- interestingly in generic cases, we're seeing customers go to UPLC performance quickly. In other cases, they just like the flexibility that the H-Class gives them in terms of converting methods or running both UPLC and HPLC columns. So maybe it's a little bit slower given economic conditions, but I don't think it really changes the overall model.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And I also wanted to ask about some of the service infrastructure that you'd put into place last year. Are those costs being fully absorbed today? Or can you look for some kind of margin sort of upside from that?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I'd say on the service front, we traditionally need to add service headcount at about the same rate as service sales grow. We went through a period certainly during the recession. We didn't do that. We caught up a little bit on that expense as of late, and I think right now, we're probably right in line with where we need to be. We have been adding a few heads in some of the developing parts of the world where we've needed to. But I would say, don't expect any meaningful change in gross margin on the service side. Because I'd say we're pretty well fully utilizing the headcount that's there and have very small plans for additions to keep up with the sales volume in emerging markets that will, net, keep that margin where it is.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just real quick. Could you comment on pricing as well?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Our pricing, I'd say there's no news on the pricing front. In this climate, you might expect that pricing competition would heat up, you could say, maybe in a few situations. But we have always maintained our position as selling based on most everything else other than low price. So service and support and technological differentiation, we believe continue to be the drivers of our business. And as you can see from our margin performance, we're not wavering from that theory and see no signs that we're losing material amounts of business because of it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "I was hoping that you could give us some flavor of what the bookings and the book to bill look like as we exited the quarter.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "The very little difference between order rates and sales rate, Dan. So I'd say it's no news there.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "And also, could you give us a little more color on what's behind your expectation that India is going to get better over the next couple of quarters?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think -- first of all, our forecast -- the numbers that John shared with you don't count on a tremendous uptick in that business. But on the ground level and really -- with orders in India, we typically wait to book the orders until those customers have cleared their letters of credit. That process -- that end process in typical years is not a big delay process from when the customers place their purchase order to when they clear their bank credit. That process has slowed significantly with the weakness of the rupee and a lot of these companies having to change their credit lines. So what we're looking at is a pretty big -- I don't want to call it backlog because those orders don't become into our backlog as until they clear credit. But a good sign that the underlying demand on the ground in India is much higher than our current run rate. Now they still have to ultimately get the money, but I -- traditionally, in periods of a weakening rupee, they have done that. I think there's a little additional flavor of government turbulence in India and change in leadership, so that might add a degree of uncertainty. But long term, those generic accounts have to build capacity to take on the generic marketplace. So -- and we have, by far, the leading share in our product lines in those accounts. So if that breaks through at all, we should see meaningful uptick in our expectations.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "And then my final question is just housekeeping. John, when you mentioned the new guidance incorporates current exchange rates, does current mean end of the quarter or -- and so like $1.27 euro? Or does it mean today we're at $1.21 euro?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I actually use the $1.22, is what I used in the numbers.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "I wonder, Doug, if you -- I was very interested in kind of what you talked about the quarter. You said April was good, orders came in. May was okay. And then you said kind of throughout June, you saw kind of the -- you saw the approval process for capital expenditures starting to become elongated. Can you maybe talk about, either geographically more where your -- where that comment was coming from or via end market? And in particular, I'm wondering -- I mean it sounds like you expected the U.S. to still remain fairly strong, kind of mid-single-digit growth here, but it's -- Danaher, on their call said -- in their kind of -- in their sort of life science markets in the U.S., they actually started to see weakness in some of the areas you were talking about. So just kind of wanted to get a little bit more detail there.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think that you may be -- what I said was that some of the orders that were delayed in the first quarter, we really saw them booked in the early part of April. So that did encourage us that some of those delays were behind us. Unfortunately, we saw a new delay kind of creep into the process, Jon, so that didn't signal a real uptick in run rate. I think this issue of when things occur in the quarter -- as you know, we always have a big bolus of orders that comes in late in the quarter. I think everybody in this industry still runs on that kind of model. Our experience in June was pretty good. Orders were -- saw [ph] the fields talking about run rates picking up. We see one area up, one area experiencing slowness. You're continuing to monitor that. So it's a bit of a struggle to, say, overall, anything changed in June. Some areas picked up in June, and some areas that were expecting orders to come in, didn't. So I'd say the life science business was actually reasonably good right through June. It was the industrial piece that probably -- we saw -- we certainly didn't see the run rate of business late in the quarter that we expected. It wasn't strong early, but it was probably weaker as we ended the quarter. So I mean that's part of the reality of saying, what's the next month, the next quarter, the next half year going to be like. And we roll in all of this. We listen to others in the industry, the competitors and what they're saying and roll in our specific factors. I think we've got some individual circumstances that give us some reason to be optimistic that the second half could be better than the first half. But overall, we think that the economic climate's going to be pretty much like it is now, I mean, maybe a little bit worse in some areas, but I think we have no reason to believe that it's falling off a cliff.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Just maybe a follow-up and are you -- internally, are you kind of elongating or changing your own approval process for capital expenditures? And then if I -- as a quick follow-up too on the industrial, what is it that's keeping -- typically, we thought TA would be much more kind of that exposed to the industrial, but you're still getting double-digit growth there. So maybe, why do you think you're seeing that in TA given the comment [indiscernible] ...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. I'll let John talk a little bit about TA. But in terms of our own capital, yes, we are tighter on our capital release. Now one of our more significant capital programs is the site in Manchester for our mass spec operations, and that's kind of all systems go. But we are tighter. However, you know we're not a capital-expensive business, so -- But I think we share everybody else's -- when we tighten the belt, we don't just tighten the belt on expenses and go wild on the capital side because the depreciation and interest hit you later. I mean, we apply the same general constraints across the board and look much more hard on the immediate payback to those capital programs. And John, you want to talk about TA?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I would say as it relates to TA, TA Instruments, as you know, has a very competitive offering up and down its line right now. So I'd say, competitively, it's in a very good shape. We've said earlier that microcalorimetry had a good quarter, had the good half. The outlook there is very optimistic and continuing to be able to place those instruments into pharmaceutical settings. So the pharma piece of what they do is very strong at this point in time. And the new high-temp products that are just now being integrated into the line and passed out to the sales force is very encouraging. We think that the technologies that we have, they'll be able to compete with the market leader in that space, and we think that, that will continue to allow TA to drive growth at least mid-single digits as we think about the second half of the year in spite of perhaps a more difficult industrial chemical customer base.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I want to just understand this outlook in the second half for Europe, Japan. I think, Doug or John, you said that Europe, Japan combined would be flat in the second half. But your Europe comps get a lot harder. Your Japanese comps get a lot easier on constant currency basis. So can you split those 2 country -- or those 2 geographies out and give us some more specifics on how you're viewing Europe and Japan for the second half guidance?", "John A. Ornell", "I would say that the run rate of what we're expecting is going to be about the same moving into Q3 and Q4. Japan has been a difficult environment for us for many years and for others. So we've never had much more than kind of a low-single-digit expectation for that part of the world anyway, so thinking about that being relatively flat is not really too far off from historical expectations. Europe, we saw a rather, I guess, traditional split of growth in Europe, kind of soft in the southern side where you would expect. Germany was okay. France was okay. U.K. was a little bit soft in Q2. We don't think that, that continues as soft as it was in the second half of year. Certainly, we don't have any expectations for Southern Europe to get better. But we have also had a somewhat softer Eastern Europe than we might have thought, and we think that there, it's possible that we'll see a little bit more growth in the second half than we did in the first. So I mean, maybe Europe ends up being, from base of comparison, a little different than what we saw in the second quarter, but I don't think it's dramatically different, and you end up splitting hairs at that level.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then on pricing, Doug, you said there's a few situations where pricing is actually heating up. Can you elaborate on that? Are you talking about mass spec? What exactly do you mean by [indiscernible] pricing in India [ph] ?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "No, you misunderstood me. I say every quarter you see some particular order where somebody's dramatically discounting and the field wants to it match it, something that -- I would say we're not seeing a materially different environment today than we've seen for the last 1.5 years. I mean, every quarter, some competitor decides that price competition is the way they're going to make their quarter, and we deal with that all the time, and we don't respond to it. So that's why our margins hold up, and I don't want anybody to come away with the fact that we're seeing a dramatically different climate. We're seeing the same amount that we always see.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. So then specific to mass spec, can you just comment on the competitive environment there? And were you able to launch your new single quad and what kind of traction that got?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure, John.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. The new single quad actually grew relatively nicely in the quarter on a pretty poor base of comparison. So I'd say we're optimistic that the single quadrupole space for us will look better than it has historically as we look at the back half of the year. That being said, I'd say we're probably comfortable with our tandem quadrupole position and continue to look at that as being a very competitive space but one where we have a competitive product and don't feel uncomfortable there looking into the second half. It's probably the high-end part of the market where we see the most competitive pressure, and there are good and valid options for customers on that front. And that is the market space for us that today is the most competitive.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "And it's the place that a big piece of that market is into nonprofit government and academic labs. We're worried about that segment of the market more than others. We are beginning to ship our new high-end G2-S products, so we're hopeful that, that can stimulate things. But overall, we're not holding out for a return to aggressive growth rates in that segment of the MS market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Who is that?", "John A. Ornell", "Doug Schenkel.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Let me -- can I just start with a housekeeping question. What was the M&A contribution for the quarter? And what's built into expectations for either the second half or the full year?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, there was this -- a very small amount in TA. I think about 3% of their 11 were 0.3 bps in the total business was associated with the high-temp acquisition. And that's not likely to be dramatically different as we look at the second half.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then actually maybe another housekeeping, QTof -- I apologize if I just missed this. But I know QTof was one of a few weak spots in Q1. Did that hold up any better in Q2?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "It was still down in the quarter. It wasn't down as much as it was, I believe, in the first quarter if I recall the sales numbers correctly. But it was still detracted certainly from the growth, and I think it's the G2-S that we're holding out some hope for in being able to prop that up as we move forward.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So just turning back to some questions about -- I guess a question following up on some of the spending questions from earlier. Your management of SG&A in the quarter was really encouraging, but maybe at the same time, I guess, arguably surprising, given how positive you guys seemed to be over the first couple months of the quarter, and I think your annual compensation increase actually occurred in April as planned, so I guess what I'm curious about is when in the quarter exactly did you start to really pull back on spend. And I guess somewhat related to that, how low can constant currency revenue growth drop to for you guys where you can still get operating leverage? I think that number, at least recently, used to be around 5%. It sounds like it's a little bit lower than that now.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I'd say right out of the gate and certainly the start of the year, we had many of the incremental spend programs targeted to begin in the second quarter. And having had a relatively slow start to the year, shall we say, we pushed many of those programs out to the beginning of the third quarter. So right out of the gate, even though we might have been thinking that the quarter was going to materialize to be something a bit higher organically that it turns out to be, we did not do anything on the spend front to turn up the gas, if you will, at the start of the second quarter. All of the controls that were in place through the first quarter remained in the second quarter. So from that perspective, we really had kind of a head start, if you will, and have held back in many areas: travel, advertising, project expense. There was a number of different areas where we've been able to hold the line, and that's in spite of, as you point out, the fact that we went through a relatively normal merit process around the world. But that was up against the base of a merit program that was comparable. So the comparable number increased, too. So I would say, the holding of the line in SG&A going forward to organically be a very low-single-digit type of an increase that will be completely offset by FX and nets out to something that might be flattish to maybe down slightly is really just holding the line on the expenses that we currently are. I would say that there's not a lot of room to go much lower organically than where we are without having to take different measures. But this is certainly a couple of points organic growth less spend. What we would -- what we have historically said, it's kind of the floor from which you can get margin leverage. And actually at these levels, we're really just holding operating income about flat with prior year. We're not providing incremental leverage.  A lot of the EPS growth that you're getting at a flat top line with currency is coming from the share repurchase program.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So the new 5% is something like 3% in terms of where you can get leverage at the operating line?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, right. And that's how many years that can be sustained. I mean, we'd have to really look at that in a bit more detail. But certainly, this year is intact at that level.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, over the short term, I think that's there.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A lot of mine have been answered, but maybe just to go back, Doug, to your comments on the competitive dynamics in mass spec, understanding that the market still remains challenging, do you see an opportunity here to pick up share given your current product lineup? And conversely, are you convinced that all the kind of delays you saw last quarter and I think you talked about a few this quarter, are actually delays versus swap-outs?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I wouldn't argue long and hard that in the first 6 months, we haven't lost some high-end orders, Tycho. The SYNAPT G2-S is an important piece that's coming into the market, and we'll have to see how that responds. But this whole area, I think, is one of the most challenged for instrument manufacturers. These are high-end instruments. The academic and government market is a much bigger piece of this market than it is of the traditional chromatography market. And I think that's the market that's going to be most challenged. So it's a tough area for all of us. That doesn't mean there's no spending there, but it's not the area that I'd look for the most rigorous uptick in the second half.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And how are you thinking about the clinical opportunity for mass spec? I mean, a handful of us were at ACC last week, and there seems to be a bit more emphasis from the tool providers you were earlier on and kind of moving mass spec into the clinical side of things. Can you just talk about the competitive dynamics there? And are there milestones we should be thinking about as you continue to kind of build out the clinical business over the next couple of years?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think we're very optimistic about the clinical business. It's still less than -- well, it's a single-digit piece of our overall business. It has major opportunities, but it's an area where the regulatory issues still kind of have to be worked out in many of these applications. There are some applications that are robust, tried and true. Drugs of abuse and pain testing and things like that are very active areas today. And I do think some of them have flipped over to mass spec technology almost exclusively. So that's good news. I think to the extent that a number of these customers are still being challenged on their own, that is the clinical testing markets, still a little bit cautious about looking for extraordinary growth there, but I think it's likely to be better than average as we go over the next 6 to 12 months.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Can you just -- in the context of the 2% Waters instrument systems growth, I'd love to hear if you roll up mass spec and you roll up LC, what did those 2 businesses do? And also what are you looking for, for the year for mass spec instruments and LC instruments?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. 2 points, and I decide [ph] LC did better than mass spec. And certainly, as you look at tougher CapEx environments, mass spec comes under pressure a lot more quickly, as you know, than the LC side. So there was more stability as you'd expect in the LC instrument side, and there's more variability with the mass spec instrument.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, John, can you update us on cash flow guidance and buyback guidance for the year, please?", "John A. Ornell", "On the cash flow side, with the new guidance that we've put out there, I'd say that we\u2019re looking to approach maybe $475 million free cash flow for the full year before the Manchester facility. That will probably bring it down to closer to $450 million for the full year. And on the share repurchase side, we just did 103, we did about 60-something in the first quarter, so around 170-ish, I think, through the midyear. You're probably looking at that to grow to somewhere around 300, 325, anyway, as we make our -- $300 million to $325 million as we make our way through the second half of the year. And we'll see depending on share price, we may do a little more, a less but something in that range probably makes sense.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Doug, if I can ask a question on China, just some of your peers have been talking about the release of government funds for the 5-year plan kind of picking up in the back half. The trajectory of that acceleration has been somewhat under debate, but  generally, one that we're also looking for. So could you maybe comment on what your view is there in terms of visibility on government funds? And then secondarily, I thought you said that attach rates for UPLC are lower than HPLC. Can you confirm that's what you said because I actually thought you guys have been saying the reverse in previous quarters because...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sorry, you said -- what do you think I said?", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Attach rates for UPLC. I think in the past, you guys have said that the attach rates are higher because there's less competition. And I thought you said they were lower on the call earlier [indiscernible] ...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "H", "Yes. What I was referring to is that the attach rates on H-Class are lower than the attach rates on classical UPLC because with H-Class, you're still seeing our customers run traditional HPLC methods as they -- a way to switch over to UPLC. So that's still a good source of UPLC columns. It's just not as high an attach rate as the I-Class or the traditional HPLC.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then China? Yes.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, China. We are more -- we more look at the individual input that we're getting from individual ministries and our people on the ground. As other people have been concerned about China, our organization has held pretty firm. One of the benefits we have in China is that our business is very diverse. I mean it's -- unlike some of the other areas that are heavily aimed at pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical-like applications, China is into food safety, food quality. It's a good mix between western companies who are in the China market as well as more traditional Chinese customers. The mix of all of that has held up well, and we're reasonably confident of it holding up in the second half. Frankly, we haven't factored in an uptick because of long-term planning on the part of the Chinese. We think it's kind of more run rate like that we're likely to see in the second half.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Just have one quick question. Doug, you talked about applied markets being a little softer, and you kind of mentioned about the temporary pause. What gives you confidence that's more temporary and it's not maybe, perhaps, the market becoming more saturated?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, we see no sign of saturation in terms of the underlying dynamics, the request for demonstrations, the request for quotes on the part of these application. And we've seen these kinds of swings historically where you've got a big amount in the base, you've got a lump of business and then that lump tails off. But out of each cycle comes a higher level of spending. The regulations in these markets aren't getting easier. If anything, the opportunity for the regulations to get more stringent in the United States as we really await the implementations of the food safety regs in the United States, we think have the opportunity to add momentum in these markets. So we're not terribly concerned. The one exception to the non-pharmaceutical there is the industrial chemical market. It's more related to macroeconomic demand. A lot of it's derivative to the world auto industry as that places demands on polymers and chemicals. And we're cautious about the dynamics in that segment of the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "John, I just want to talk a little bit about FX and gross margins. I mean, in 2007 and '08, you had significantly big improvements in the gross margin. Some of that -- and certainly in 2009, that helped offset some of the weakness in the market. And I mean, I know you -- obviously, there's other things in terms of product mix, the manufacturing that kind of goes with this. But as we kind of look for 2013 and we think about where currency rates are right now, and how much can you kind of offset? And what could you predict would be the impact of FX that we're kind of looking through really. Would you still have the same type of ability to offset some of the headwinds?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I'd say, certainly, as we've looked at FX across this year, kind of including the second quarter where rates currently sit, I mean we didn't, in the second quarter, experience the full impact of the rates where they've landed at the end of the quarter. As you know, it's average of those rates across the quarter, but there was very little impact on gross margin percentages based on the fact that the relationship of the currencies versus the dollar kind of moved consistently. We have a -- we had a euro that for us, we can pretty much hedge the same way that organically, we see flow-through from our business. We see about the same flow-through on the euro impact, so it doesn't have a big gross margin impact. We didn't see a big change in the yen or the pound. Those are items that are, generally speaking, are strong. Yen is good for margins. A weak pound is good for margins. And we didn't see dramatic movements in those currencies, so we had some stability in the gross margin performance on the FX side. So I'd say the FX flow-through was pretty much what we expected, more of it because of the -- overall, there was a bigger impact. But given where rates are right now, I wouldn't have you believe that there's going to be a big gross margin percent impact like we had seen historically.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Okay. Well, thank you all for sticking with us. We ran a little bit later than we traditionally do, but hopefully, that got most of your questions answered, and as always, we'll be prepared to answer any follow-up questions that you have as the next few days unroll. So thanks a lot, and we'll hopefully be back with you next quarter. We can sign off now.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you. Well, and good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call, as is usual, is John Ornell, the Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "And as is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter's results. John will follow with details of our financials and provide you with our outlook for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John A. Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q4 2012. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 in Part I under the caption Business Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release conference call and webcast is currently planned for January 2013.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to our company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those listed in our schedule, entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share, included in this morning's press release.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well, our third quarter in total was much like we saw in the first half of 2012. Constant currency sales were up about 2% in the quarter, and within the range that we had discussed 3 months ago. Looking at our results by customer category, we also saw a general continuation of first half trends with pharmaceutical end markets delivering more stable growth in an otherwise challenging demand environment.", "In the third quarter, there was a more pronounced spread in our geographically defined segments, with Asia delivering relatively strong revenue growth with more constrained demand in the U.S. than we had earlier anticipated.", "Throughout the quarter, we focused our field organizations towards promoting the superior value of Waters' offering in order to maintain a disciplined pricing strategy, and at the same time, we've closely monitored our expenses. These steps, in combination with the continuation of our share repurchase program, allowed us to grow our adjusted earnings per share despite the demand and currency headwinds we encountered in the quarter.", "As in prior periods of economic pressure, our recurring revenue, the combination of our service and chemical consumables product lines, stabilized our overall business performance, and in the third quarter solid growth for these recurring lines largely offset a modest decline in instrument system sales. In general, order flow through the quarter did not suggest an overall weakening or strengthening of demand as we approach the fourth quarter.", "Looking at the quarter's performance for the Waters division geographically, China was the engine of our Asian growth in the quarter, and we saw nice increases in all segments of our business there. General concerns that we have recently heard regarding a slowing of economic growth in China are not apparent in our third quarter results or in the outlook that we have in the fourth quarter. Our business in Japan declined modestly in constant currency terms, with strength in life science segments offsetting most of the weaknesses in the chemicals sector. India continued to be problematic for us in the quarter, and performed similarly as it had earlier in the year with a weak local currency and cautious customer base delaying instrument purchases in spite of what we see as increasing drug production requirements. We are hopeful that growth in India will show some improvement as we close out this calendar year.", "North American demand was weaker than we had hoped for and the slowness that we saw spanned across just about all customer groups. The deceleration from our second quarter's results indicates to us a more cautious and constrained capital spending environment, resulting in more sporadic ordering patterns. At this point, we feel that demand will moderately improve in the fourth quarter to a more positive result, and believe that there are capital budgets that will be deployed in the closing months of the year.", "Our European business held up reasonably well in the quarter, especially in light of the macro concerns that dominate the news these days. Pharma was strong in the quarter, and even the more economically sensitive industrial segments performed pretty well. Government and academic spending was under pressure, but do not account for a large proportion of our European sales.", "Positive global pharmaceutical demand in the quarter was weighted towards instruments for late development and quality control applications, and we saw a generally solid demand for services in chemistry. Demand for products supporting small molecule therapies seemed to hold up better than for biopharmaceuticals, all suggesting more conservative capital spending plans. We are encouraged to see that our ACQUITY H-Class system continued to move into quality control applications, as this continues to represent a large upgrade opportunity for us.", "Our business with ethical and generic firms was more robust in the quarter than for biotechnology-focused companies and CROs. It's interesting to note that the overall growth in the generic business is, in spite of the declines previously noted in India, a business dominated by generic manufacturing demand.", "As we saw last quarter, the combination of government and university shipments grew moderately for the Waters division. The growth was geographically variable, with Japan and Asia posting double-digit increases, while North America and Europe were under pressure. In general, governmental spending was stronger than academic, and in particular, we saw a heavy demand for food safety applications from governmental agencies in China.", "Looking outside our life science end markets and for the Waters division, demand from industrial chemical customers, those working in companies involved with the development and manufacture of fine chemicals or energy production, was weak in the quarter, with product shipments declining modestly in comparison to last year, but sequentially fairly stable with volume in the second quarter. There is little indication that demand is likely to dramatically change in the fourth quarter. This is somewhat encouraging news for those of us who witnessed much sharper declines for these segments in the late 2008 and 2009 time frame.", "For applied markets, food and environmental testing, and aside from the already mentioned strong performance in food safety in China, demand in the quarter was tepid, resulting in flattish sales. We continue to believe that food applications represent a considerable growth opportunity for us in the future.", "Looking at TA Instruments, revenue growth moderated to a low-single-digit rate, a deceleration from growth we saw earlier in the year but, I feel, somewhat explainable, given the historic sensitivity of this business to broader economic conditions and the formidable comparison to last year's very strong results. Geographically, business growth was relatively balanced in light of last year's quarterly comparisons. And from a product perspective, weaker thermal shipments were offset by nicely growing biocalorimetry and high temperature systems. I'm cautiously optimistic that sales growth may pick up in the fourth quarter, as newly introduced thermal system demand is promising and as we continue to broaden our application footprint.", "Turning back to the Waters division and looking at product line trends. H-Class ACQUITY UPLC and Xevo tandem quadrupole-based, especially our ultrasensitive Xevo TQ-S, continue to represent strong system offerings. For our systems that include mass spectrometry capability, our quadrupole-based instruments, both high performance tandem and single quad devices, saw growth in the quarter. On the other hand, our more research-focused Tof-based technology systems were under pressure, primarily from what we view as a more constrained research spending environment in drug companies, as well as in government and university settings.", "Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew organically at a 7% rate in the quarter, a rate that's fairly consistent with longer-term trends, and likely to continue as we close out 2012. Within our columns business, ACQUITY UPLC columns continue to represent a high-growth opportunity, and attachment to our UPLC instrument platforms appears to be holding at an impressive rate that's more than double our typical HPLC attachment rate. We expect that our ACQUITY column growth opportunity will become an increasingly important business advantage as more UPLC-based QC methodologies are deployed.", "Now before turning you over to John, I want to say a few words about our planning process as we approach 2013 and beyond. First, we remain focused on a product strategy that's based on driving a differentiated performance advantage. In doing so, we believe that we are uniquely capable of supporting new instruments that are performance-leading and easily used by a diverse and increasingly regulation-driven market. We view advanced software that best addresses scientific workflow as key to our competitive advantage. Accordingly, you can expect to see from us in 2013 and beyond an increasing proportion of our systems designed upon our new unified operating system, a system that will facilitate the migration of UPLC/MS technology, employing advanced separations chemistries into regulated methods.", "We have a rich history of new product innovation that we have effectively translated into industry-leading financial performance. To that end, an ability to modulate spending to accommodate variations in demand due to macroeconomic factors is an important consideration in our planning process. So looking at 2013, I want you to know that our intent will be to execute a business strategy that balances both the long and short-term financial performance of the company.", "2012 has turned out to be a more challenging year than we originally envisioned. However, the outlook for the full year that John will be sharing with you will highlight our ability to accommodate uncertainties, and continue to leverage both our P&L and balance sheet. Now here's John with further details. John?", "John A. Ornell", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter sales decreased by 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 4% at $1.18 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.14 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.12 this quarter versus $1.10 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.", "Reviewing Q3 sales results in comparison to Q3 last year. Before foreign currency translation, sales were up a bit over 2% from prior year's third quarter. Translation reduced sales by about 3%.", "Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were down 4%, Europe's sales were up 4%, Japan was down 1%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 9%. On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales decreased by 2% and recurring revenues grew by 7% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 1% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q3 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in at 59.4%, down somewhat from Q3 last year, principally due to foreign currency translation and sales mix. SG&A expenses were down 4% as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, tighter spending controls and lower variable compensation. R&D expenses increased by just 1% this quarter.", "On the tax front, a minor shift in operating profits among our legal entities raised our effective operating tax rate to about 16.5% going forward. Offsetting this in Q3 was a slight true-up of our tax accruals from final 2001 returns filed this quarter, keeping our tax rate at about 16% this period. Net interest expense was $5.9 million, and share count came in at 88.5 million shares, 3.6 million shares lower than Q3 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1,448,000,000, and debt totaled $1,148,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of about $300 million. As for share repurchases, we bought 800,000 shares of our common stock for $64 million. This leaves about $706 million remaining on the current authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. For Q3, free cash flow came in at $82 million after funding $26 million of CapEx. Excluded from CapEx is $9 million of capital spend associated with our new Manchester facility. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 73 days this quarter, up 2 days from Q3 last year, and inventories increased by $11 million this quarter.", "Overall, Q3 materialized largely as expected, with customers' continued reluctance to spend capital freely in these less certain times. At this time, we expect these more difficult conditions to remain in effect throughout the remainder of the year. A continuation of these conditions means we expect sales growth pre-currency effects to stay around 2%, and currency at today's levels will reduce sales by about 2%, bringing sales growth to around flat for the fourth quarter.", "Moving down the P&L for Q4. We expect gross margins to be about 60.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be down slightly from Q4 2011. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $6 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to be about 16.5%. Our fully diluted share count for Q4 is likely to be around 87.5 million shares outstanding. Rolling all of these together, we currently expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.62 per share. For the full year, this would result in sales growth of about 2% pre-currency. Currency translation will reduce sales by 2%, resulting in flat sales in 2012 versus 2011. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in a range of $4.90 to $4.95. Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. I think, at this point, operator, we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with IS Group (sic) [ISI Group].", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So let's talk about the revenue line. Obviously, the trends you saw in the quarter were fairly consistent with what we've seen sort of in the broader market. I guess, as we think about what we saw toward the end of the quarter and through the jump off point to 4Q, I mean, what are sort of the puts and takes or sort of the opportunities and risks on either, whether it would be by segment or geography, that you sort of see? Because what I'm trying to get at is when you look at the 4Q guide, it's basically almost an acceleration, I guess, on the CapEx side of the business because you have a bit of a tougher comp, and so I'm just trying to see where you see sort of the key inflection points that kind of get us to that 2% midpoint.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Ross, I don't think we're intending to say that we're seeing a real step function in what's coming at the fourth quarter. The pattern of activity over the third quarter wasn't highly variable. It was a pretty consistent quarter. We didn't see a significant drop in demand late in the quarter, as some have talked about. Pretty consistent. Now the fourth quarter is always a big quarter. It's the biggest quarter of the year and it was, of course, last year, but we don't really see much of a change in the momentum that we're expecting in the fourth quarter. And I'd say early on, it's early on in the fourth quarter, but that's reflected in how we're seeing early on in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess my point, so if you look at like the U.S., which deteriorated q-on-q, I mean, there's really no reason for that to get better. If anything, with sort of the uncertainty from the fiscal cliff, I mean, most CapEx companies are citing an assumption that, that actually gets worse. I know you have a bit of a different mix than the traditional industrial guy, but I guess, what are you sort of baking into the forecast for kind of that 4Q trend, particularly in the U.S. business?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Ross, just to embroider a little bit, when you look at our geographic segments, sometimes you have to look at specific order details that happen in the base and -- versus what we anticipate happening in this fourth quarter. In the case of the United States, for instance, the third quarter of last year had some very large orders that were unique to the third quarter and didn't repeat in the fourth quarter. We are very strongly anticipating almost a swing in that. So we'll see some large orders come in, in the U.S. in the fourth quarter this year that weren't in the fourth quarter base. So when you annualize or adjust for that, we're still seeing that the underlying trends to be essentially what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. U.S. demand, we don't expect to make a step function, but we do expect that this quarterly adjustment of these large orders will swing in the favor of the U.S. in the fourth quarter, where they swung unfavorably in the third quarter. Does that help?", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I think so. And so, I guess, I mean, if we do see a pause in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, I mean, how comfortable do you feel on the cost front? I mean, you managed costs exceptionally well in the last few quarters. How much more room do you feel like is there?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, we think that our -- as you know, we don't try to empty the bucket in our forecast. We don't -- we try to strike a reasonable course, hopefully erring a little bit on the conservative side as we posture ourselves. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves on the spending line and then have to carve back dramatically. So we think as we plan for our revenue line, we hope that there are opportunities to exceed that, and so we've planned our spending accordingly. I think that probably says it as well as I could say it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Just one quick clarification and then a question for you, Doug, and I'll just ask them at the same time. So, John, on the gross margin, can you just -- it looked like mix -- since instruments were down and some of the consumables chemistry were up, I would have thought maybe mix would have been a little bit better, but you highlighted mix as one of the reasons gross margins were down. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about gross margin? And then, Doug, just wanted to clarify on the '13, maybe give a little bit color on what you mean. Is it more balanced approach? Is it you focus maybe on spending a little bit more in '13 to ensure better revenue growth in kind of the out years? Maybe just give a little bit more color as to what you meant by a more balanced approach.", "John A. Ornell", "Okay. Jon, on the gross margin front, starting first, looking at currency, we had a much more favorable currency environment from a gross margin perspective in the 2011 period. We had a strongly appreciating yen and a relatively weaker pound, and that is always a recipe for higher margins for this business. So against that strong base of comparison, currency translation hurt gross margins by somewhere around 50 bps. Of the remainder, somewhere around 40 bps of the difference year-over-year within the quarter is more of a product story within TA. We saw what we think is a temporary shift away from shipments of some of its higher-end products that actually created a little backlog there that we think comes back in the fourth quarter, but affected margins at TA and for the overall business in this quarter, and a higher service mix within the quarter was favorable to operating margins, but not as favorable to gross margins. So I think as we think about all of that and look at Q4, thinking about margins kind of coming back to being somewhere around 60.5% is where we are currently comfortable.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, John, as it relates to 2013, first, as I'm sure you remember, we don't provide detailed guidance until we finish the fourth quarter and have our conference call in January. So we're going to stick with that. But in terms of, perhaps, what I'm hinting at, is the most difficult time that companies like Waters and many others has in looking and planning and executing the next year is when you have a dramatic change in momentum as you exit the year. As you'll recall, in 2008, as economic conditions rapidly deteriorated, it was a year that was looking very good and most plans were anticipating pretty strong growth, and then all of a sudden, you had to dramatically react to a change in demand dynamics. We don't anticipate that for 2013, and in that sense, I think it's going to be easier to balance and to plan for the coming year. A lot of open issues, of course, for 2013, political issues, economic issues, government spending, but I think, if anything, the planning is going to be more or less on the conservative side, and potentially more opportunity for an improvement as life goes on in 2013. But for us, that means that we can focus on the things that we're good at, where we're able to produce reasonable results in that tough economic climate when we can see it -- particularly when we can see it coming at us at that rate of speed. So I think that's kind of what I mean when I say, 2013, right now, you wouldn't say that there are a tremendous amount of upside opportunities, but it's not going to be a dramatic change, and therefore, I think it's going to be easier to balance your execution next year. Does that help?", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Yes. So I recognize you weren't going to give specific guidance, but that's helpful. So it's not -- I get a few e-mails. They're just kind of comments around, is there a significant change that you're kind of posturing towards for 2013? It doesn't sound like that's the case. I think that's helpful.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo.", "Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I was hoping maybe you can make some comments on pricing across your various product lines.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure. I would say, with very few exceptions, our pricing has held up across the board. There's nothing in these results that you should interpret as significant price pressures entering into the competitive equation. We have nothing in our gross margin analysis that reflects any significant price concessions, and we don't believe that we stand to gain a whole lot by adjusting our pricing mechanisms, and in particular, places where we have seen weaknesses this quarter, we can't find any lost business because of price. We frankly don't see a whole lot of business being lost to competition that we didn't have in previous quarters. So we don't see a lot of market share changes. It's largely -- our results are largely due to economic factors, not individual competitive factors, I would say.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to revisit the gross margin commentary. I appreciate that the year-over-year comparison was heavily influenced by foreign currency, but I wouldn't think the sequential Q2 to Q3 comparison would have been influenced by foreign currency very much at all and yet, there was a big sequential drop in margins. So I'm curious if you can offer more color into that, John. And then also, what gives you comfort that gross margins will increase sequentially at about 100 bps in the fourth quarter?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, there were small differences in currency, Q2 to Q3. Sometimes, there's differences in the accounting for the value of inventory quarter-to-quarter, so it's really tough to get it down to a difference of 10 or 20 bps on the margin line. Certainly, within the quarter, what was different, though, was the product mix piece versus the year-over-year. We did not see, for example, the TA shift away from the shipments of high-end products in the quarter in Q2, so we had a very strong margin, actually, at TA there. So I would say the bigger difference, Q2 to Q3, is more of a product story than it is the currency difference. And for the fourth quarter, typically, what we see is a meaningful pick up year-over-year, really associated with volume leverage of the manufacturing organizations. So we have a relatively fixed base of manufacturing cost. We're producing more. We're getting favorable manufacturing variances on that. So if you go back in time, you'll see that Q4 traditionally has a much higher gross margin year-over-year. We're still expecting about a 40 bps decline versus history, and that's really all currency in the fourth quarter versus the prior year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "First, just a clarifying question on gross margins. John, is the 60.5% gross margin guidance for the year or for the quarter?", "John A. Ornell", "That's for the quarter. That would bring the year to somewhere around maybe 60.25%.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So you guys have been managing spend very aggressively. Specifically, R&D spend looks to be tracking to grow at the lowest rate since 2009 this year, and SG&A, factoring in FX, is expected to decline year-over-year in 2012 for the first time since 2009. In your prepared remarks, Doug, you talked about the fact that investors should recognize that you intend to balance near and long-term interests next year. Could you specifically talk about whether or not you can maintain investment at these levels or whether you do need to catch up next year, keeping in mind that you are going to be investing for both the near term and the long term?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, sure, Doug. I think in the R&D area this year, you're probably seeing a little bit of a dynamic of some of the major spend in the software area that we've had beginning to modulate a bit as our unified platform gets completed. So you're seeing some of that gross spend dynamic in software modulated from what it was a couple of years ago. In general, I'd have you believe that our R&D spend is going to be pretty close to the sales growth. So R&D spending over a relevant period of 3 to 5 years is going to grow at about our level of sales. Now we, of course, are able to leverage our R&D spending more than some because of the high consumables rate in our business that doesn't require a high level of R&D spend to support that sales volume. So in a year where our instrument business is suffering the economic conditions that it is, it's the consumables business that's supplying the lion's share of our growth, and that's what you're seeing in that R&D versus top line growth. But long-term, I'd have you modeling R&D growth not substantially different than revenue growth.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And on the SG&A side?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, the SG&A growth long-term?", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We think that we can continue to, in a long-term sense, a 3- to 5-year period, spend SG&A at a lower rate than sales growth. We're clearly doing that this year, and that's not easy when your sales growth is under as much pressure, but -- and it's -- as I said earlier, it's easier to do when you see this coming at you, and it's not a dramatic change at the end of a quarter going into the next year. So we still feel pretty good at being able to leverage our operating income with lower SG&A spending versus sales growth. It was a challenge this year, probably a bigger challenge than it is in most years, but we achieved that, and I'll have you believe that we're going to strive to achieve that next year also.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So no change to what you guys have said over the last couple of quarters. As long as organic is or constant currency growth is in that 3% range or so next year, you can get a little bit of operating leverage without compromising the long term.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "That is exactly my point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to get some color on the trends in the quarter from your large pharmaceutical customers. I know you've kind of highlighted how generics was strong, offsetting some weakness elsewhere, but could you just give us some color after -- certainly, the slow start to the year, I know last quarter, you saw a strong growth, but yet it was mostly, I think, related to the backlog that was up from Q1 to Q2. So any color on just kind of what trends you're seeing from your large pharmaceutical customers would be helpful.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. I'd say we're seeing in large pharma remarkably consistent conditions right through the year, mid-single-digit growth in that pharma category. I'd say, maybe a little bit of flavor is that we see it strongest in the small molecule Q&A area as opposed to the front end of R&D. I think that shows, to some extent, the conservatism of this customer base, focused on what they have to spend on and perhaps delaying some of the more futures. I don't know that, that's a good sign forever and ever, but I think it is something that we're seeing in our sales base, and it's been remarkably consistent, as I've said. It's -- it hasn't wavered too much, right, from the first quarter of this year, up at mid-single-digit demand pace.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe just one other quick one. Just in terms of applied market trends, I know you highlighted food, which you still see as a positive long-term growth opportunity, but can you as well just kind of tease out some color there? I know last quarter, you had pointed to sustained weakness in some of the more cyclical areas, but kind of what are you seeing today? And has industrial chemical -- have those worsened? Are those performing as expected? And on the flip side, kind of environmental and food, any kind of update there will be helpful.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think the industrial applications are challenged. I mean, I think across the board, the industrial customers are clearly most challenged in their performance currently. We are hearing the most concern about their near-term expectations. Certainly, we saw in TA, which is -- tends to be a harbinger of the industrial markets, that their growth modulated in the third quarter. Even though their orders rate was a little bit stronger than their flow-through rate, it was still softer in the third quarter than in the second quarter. So I think that broad-based, industrial segment is clearly not terribly robust. You saw it today. DuPont results were not great, and I think that's consistent across that large industrial category. I think in the applied markets, it's really a geography-by-geography story. China's food safety business continues to be strong. Environmental applications in China continued to look pretty good. Food applications, on the other hand, in the United States, I think still await a more rigorous regulatory climate. They passed, of course, some of the laws, but the regulations have still not really stepped up to mean that, that spending in the U.S. has gotten terribly robust. So it's largely a case-by-case. But clearly, in an environment where our instrument businesses are running flat to a little down, in the hardware sense, pharma is the biggest piece of that, it's in mid-single digits, and everything else is not terribly robust.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.", "Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Doug, if we stick with industrial for a minute, in Q2, you made reference to the UPC2 raising eyebrows, I think, for industrial customers. So the question really is, despite new product introductions, does anyone really care? Or are they just so afraid of their future CapEx? And then second, could you comment on -- I guess, in Q3, there was the rollout of the G2S, and what you're seeing there?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure. I'll handle the UPC2, and maybe Art can just talk a little bit about the G2S. The UPC2, Tony, we are extraordinarily enthusiastic about. It's been a good product launch. But to be fair, perhaps not quite as strong on the uptake this year as we thought it might, and I do think that, that reflects to the fact that it's a new product this year. It's not in people's capital base. They didn't plan and budget for it, and I fully suspect that we're going to see a ramp function next year as those conditions change, and we've run the samples. We've got it in our demo labs. The customer reaction to this, I think, is a huge sleeper for us next year. It is something that we continued to be very optimistic on. But to be fair, it's been a little bit tougher slog this year than I thought it would because the results on the actual samples have been so good. But I think we'll continue to report on this. I'd say this is a major opportunity for us in 2013. Art, do you want to talk about G2S?", "Arthur G. Caputo", "Yes. Yes, the G2S has done quite well for us. It's a -- in that particular segment of high-end mass spectrometry, the key there is to continually evolve your performance. That market space is keyed into that, and the nature of that segment is that they will make investments and upgrade if they believe that the performance of the system is enabling them to produce more information, better results. We have seen that play out with this product. What plays against us somewhat is the suppressed capital expenditures we see in that segment. So we're not getting the kind of velocity that we believe that product would get where capital's more readily available, but we've had some very outstanding results with this product, particularly in metabolite ID and a lot of the important applications that we think represent the future growth opportunity for that product.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Does that cover it, Tony?", "Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You bet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I just wanted to just continue on that mass spec line for a second, and tie in your earlier comments on price and share. Given that you said you're not seeing much in price competition and share doesn't seem like it's moved much, it's a little bit in contrast of what you said in the past about the mass spec market. So can you just talk about the competitive landscape in mass spec and tell us where you're at?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think, clearly, the mass spec market, particularly the high-end, is the most challenged in this climate. So I think we're clearly seeing the most demand pressure come in that segment. It's also heavily influenced in that high-end in the bio segment of the marketplace, and that seems to be one of the more problematic areas in those pharma applications today. So I have no question it would, say, in our hardware area, the high-end mass spec arena is the most challenging right now, but it's -- we don't see a whole lot of share movement in there. There may be a little bit of share movement. It's tough to tell on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but I think it's more macroeconomics that's affecting our business there than anything else. In the triple quad area and in the single quad area, our results have been quite nice, quite good, and no sign of dramatic price competition. We are holding our own and there's no real competitive news in that segment of the marketplace, I mean.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And, Doug, just a follow-up on Europe. Given that it grew 4% and you called out strength in pharma in 3Q, can you go into a little bit more detail regionally about the pharma strength in Europe?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I just think -- pretty much what I've said about pharma was typical in Europe, that the big pharma business was reasonably strong. It was concentrated in kind of those traditional pharma strongholds of small molecule, traditional drugs, weighted towards QA/QC applications rather than in major investments in the front end of R&D. So the normal suspects in terms of the big pharma entities in Europe were pretty good. Now 4%, I don't want anybody to think is the most robust conditions we've ever faced, but in a world of tough conditions, it was pretty consistent across the quarter.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Any regional weakness though in southern Europe that you can point to or not?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I wouldn't say of note in pharma. So if -- some of these large European and U.S. pharmaceutical companies have operations in Italy or have it in Spain. We don't notice that they're treating Southern Europe tremendously different for these large pharmaceutical companies. Certainly, local businesses and local government and university spending is affected in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, I'd say. I wouldn't say in Italy we're seeing terribly deficient conditions, but Spain's a challenge, but not particularly in the large pharma segment. It's more in the everything else segment, I'd say.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Jeffries.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Doug, so it looks like your share repurchase pacing slowed a little bit in the third quarter from the first half. Can you give us kind of an update for the year there on the share repurchase front, and then any commentary you can offer on the change in the M&A landscape at the margin would be helpful.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure. John, maybe you can just touch base on share repurchase.", "John A. Ornell", "Sure. On the share repurchase front, John, we had a target for the year of around 300 million. We had a kind of a front-end loading to that. So I'd say we're probably, from a full year perspective, just about on target to get to that 300 million. So it's a little bit stronger in the first half than the second, but it gives us a little bit of an advantage on the weighted share count to do it that way.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "And, John, on the M&A front, I'd say there's not much news from our perspective. We continue to look at several things in the TA portfolio that offer opportunities to fill it out. Those are not meant to be huge opportunities. And then our more mainstream or in something orthogonal to what we do, we don't see anything that should pique your interest on the horizon.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right, great. One follow-up. Doug, in a prior comment, you talked about some software-related spending moderating, but I think, if I'm not mistaken, you've got a pretty material step-up in amortization on the internal software side next year. Is that a true net event in the P&L? Or is there an offset somewhere in terms of lower spending to implement that?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think, true, as we launch new unified products, you're absolutely right that some of the spending for the development of software gets deferred and then amortized as cost of sales when you sell that software, and we'll be selling more of that software as unified started to get launched this year, and gets launched faster next year. But the revenue goes up as those products come on and the revenue is incremental.", "John A. Ornell", "Right.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "So we don't see the gross margin as being substantially challenged by that.", "John A. Ornell", "The dollars of gross margin -- we could have a little bit of a...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Right.", "John A. Ornell", "Depressant on gross margin percentage early on while we're ramping it, but certainly, the dollars should be covered in incremental sales.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "So we don't think it's going to be a material -- something that you will notice in a material sense.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Doug, I was hoping that you or John could maybe just sort of put a little more color around your assumptions on the U.S. improving in the fourth quarter, and the reason I asked is, obviously, all the checks we've done, you would suggest that there's a heightened level of uncertainty around budgeting, and so one of the first things that often goes is capital equipment. So if you kind of compare this year's outlook for fourth quarter, at least in some of these academic and pharmaceutical end markets to this year, if you can you put some more colors on why you're so confident. Beyond just a couple of large orders, why North America should improve sequentially.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure, John, you want to handle some details? And if you need more color, I'll...", "John A. Ornell", "Sure. Yes, I think as we think about the fourth quarter and look at the various markets, as Doug had said, there was a little bit of a blip in the base quarter in the U.S. in Q3 last year that maybe gave a little different impression on the underlying run rate for the U.S. than what we see in the order rate. But that being said, I would tell you that as we think about Q4 and we look at a 2% expected organic growth rate, we're looking at relatively a flattish performance from many of the developed economies in the world. So U.S., Europe, Japan are all expected to be somewhat flattish in that performance, and the expectation for ROW, Asia, maybe some of Eastern Europe economies are likely to continue to grow at a high-single-digit rate. And so we're not -- we're really not expecting a dramatic change when you think about the developed world in sum total. So I think the U.S. versus Europe dynamic, we're not expecting Europe to continue at 4, but we're not expecting the U.S. to continue at minus 4.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMC.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I want to go back to some of the comments you made earlier on pricing and market dynamics. And it sounds like you're not losing a lot of share here, but I'm wondering, in light of the numbers we've seen within the industry, if you can talk about what you think the underlying growth in the mass spec market is today. And do you see that potentially changing, in other words, accelerating as we move more to diagnostics and some additional applied markets?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure. I think, overall, the mass spec piece of the market is the most challenged right now, and if you're thinking about -- you look across all of us, you're talking low-single-digit growth and probably, the hardware piece is even softer than that across the industry. Of that kind of flattish revenue growth dynamic, Tycho, mass spec, I think, is weaker than HPLC. So I think the marketplace is, this year, down a little bit in the -- just the mass spec piece. Now it's -- you got LC/MS, and you've got overlaps between what the dynamic is in just the MS piece of the market. But clearly, to the extent that you can isolate those factors, they are higher dollar purchases. Capital spending is more restrained in those higher dollar items. They're not used as much in QC, which are much more resistant to growth. They're more in the discovery segment that people can control a little bit more. So all of those factors say mass spec is more challenged than the LC piece. The LC piece certainly has more service and consumables elements to it, and I think we're seeing that. On the other hand, I think the most challenged is the high-end research-grade instruments. I think that piece of the segment is most challenged. The triple quad into drug metabolism studies, the single quads are less challenged, and that's where we're seeing the best performance.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up for John on margins. As we think about gross margins over the next couple of years, are there obvious levers that you can pull? I mean, we're modeling about 20 bps of margin improvement going out the next couple of years per year. Can you just talk us through where you are in the manufacturing transitions? And are there other obvious levers on the gross margin side that we could be thinking about?", "John A. Ornell", "Sure. I think as we look at major product transfers and movement of production into Singapore and into Ireland, for the most part, the large amount -- the large transfers of those newer products is principally done. Over time, sure, there'll be -- incremental products will make their way into some of these lower-cost areas, but I would say that it's going to be a bit more of a challenge in a low-growth environment to think about leveraging manufacturing costs and providing meaningful gross margin improvement, and we -- the expectation will be to, at least, hold those gross margins. And to the extent that instruments can grow a few percent or better, then I think we're beginning to talk about a continuation of the volume leverage trends that will provide another 10 or 20 bps per year in what we believe will be a stable pricing environment, but there isn't a step function of gross margin improvement that we're looking at based on product transfers at this stage.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "John, just on the U.S. business, where do you focus for growth for Q4 and 2013?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "2000 and what, Peter?", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "For Q4 and 2013, where do you think the growth will be in that U.S. business?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We are not providing 2013 guidance, Peter. You're talking about this year, 2012?", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "I'm just -- I guess, when you look at the end markets, if you wanted to rank them, where would you be focusing more resources for various end markets within the U.S.?", "John A. Ornell", "I think, Peter, as we look at opportunities for the business, we still believe that the area of clinical diagnostics here in the States represents a meaningful opportunity. We think that the legislation that's been passed, but not enacted, in food safety is something that is likely to come to the forefront, perhaps once we get through the election cycle. So to the extent that there's legislation enacted and in place that looks like what's in the EU, I think there's a meaningful opportunity for improvement in sales into the food safety side of the business, so those are at least a couple of areas that we look at and focus on. And I would say, just the new chromatography system, UPC2, is something that is going to impact all markets, including the U.S. So I think from a new product perspective, coupled with the clinical diagnostics and the food safety, those are probably the bigger areas in the States that we look forward to growth in 2013 generally.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "But that comment, I'd suggest, Peter, is really on the margin. Our field resources and our marketing resources, well over 60% of our business is life science oriented. We're still going to focus most of those resources on pharma, CROs, biotech customers who are the main stream of our business. So yes, we have opportunities that arise differentially quarter-to-quarter, but the mass of our resources stays focused on a pretty predictable subset of customers.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And that balanced approach comment, that doesn't infer any changes in the way you're attacking various different markets.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "No, I mean not -- again, we introduce a new product like UPC2. We overweight demonstration activities, and we have to move some people around our laboratories to run more demos that maybe last quarter, they were doing in a different area, but it's really kind of on the margin. That's one of the reasons why we can introduce a new technology like this, and not have to layer on huge amounts of new resource. We can just move them, and then the next quarter, they'll kind of move off that a little bit and move into another area. So it's largely -- still most of their activity is focused in very traditional areas, calling on customers that we don't think are going away. They may have reduced their capital spending somewhat this year, but we've seen this dynamic year over 30 years, and they're not going away. And in all likelihood, they'll be back spending at a more regular pace as we go through future quarters, and we need to pay the same amount of attention to them quarter-after-quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Just was wondering if you could give an update on the I-Class since H-Class doing well, and it sounds like there's good demand potentially for UPC2 going forward. But just curious as to -- is all the UPLC that's being placed, going forward, going to be I-Class? Or just kind of curious just if you could provide more color there.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, sure. Art's right here. I'm sure he'd be delighted to talk about the I-Class.", "Arthur G. Caputo", "Yes, the I-Class, as we've spoken in the past, is largely focused into the use with high-end mass spectrometry. It provides the optimum separating power and performance that gives it the leverage in those research-type applications. The I-Class represents the top of the food chain amongst our entire ACQUITY line. So this product, which was rolled out roughly 1 year or more ago, has actually done quite well. It has basically enabled us to cover a broad range of UPLC utilization across the market space. We find the I-Class centers in as a very high-performance UPLC system for general applications and research, as I mentioned, largely on the front end of mass spectrometry. And as you move downstream into the development and routine areas, it speeds the method development and the process that enables you to now utilize the H-Class, which we find now going more and more into the development and quality control applications. So it's a great compliment. It fills a very important part of the cycle as we move the market space more and more into the UPLC capability region, and in all is doing quite well, and we've yet to see any competitive product that approaches its capability in that -- in the region of UPLC.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple of quick ones. John, when we look at the 16.5% tax rate, is that something we should think about carrying forward?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, I'd say at this stage, as we look at the production of products around the world, which really drives this rate, we're pretty comfortable that what we see for a mix right now was likely to be consistent with the mix that we're beginning to look at for next year. So I, right now, would anticipate that, that rate would hold as we think about 2012.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, and just -- if we assume that your currencies is where they are today, sort of like stabilized, and we don't get any real changes for next -- going into next year, is FX a help or a hurt to the gross -- to the overall margin of the company?", "John A. Ornell", "I'd say, right now, I mean, that rate has certainly gone up and down. I think it's getting to be something relatively neutral at levels where it exists today. I'd have to do some analysis to completely prove that, but I wouldn't think that FX from a sales perspective or even from a contribution perspective is going to be a meaningful piece of the overall earnings picture next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Arias with UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "You guys mentioned better demand for small molecule focuses this quarter, so I guess, can you comment on budgets in biotech, maybe particularly with respect to smaller companies, where cash is obviously a bit more of a concern?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think our performance this quarter was less robust in that biotech segment of the marketplace, as well as in the biomolecules segment of the traditional pharma business. We don't think that, that's a long-term market dynamic. Almost all of big pharma is kind of torqueing their businesses around to focus more on biopharmaceuticals rather than the more traditional small molecule drug marketplace. What we do think we see in this kind of period when there are clearly capital controls on, the thing that you can cut back on is the new stuff and the new stuff is bio. So -- and you can't cut back on worn-out instruments that are controlling production of the old drugs. So in macro terms, we think that's really what you're seeing kind of in the near-term. Over the long term, and I think that you'll see this in 2013, the bio segment, including the smaller bio markets, are likely to come back into the picture and be a more traditional piece of the pharma marketplace.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And can I just ask quickly for you to remind us how much of your business is food safety at this point?", "John A. Ornell", "Somewhere around 6%, 7%, something like that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Just given lots of talk on the mass spec market, I was wondering if you could provide some commentary on how you guys see the liquid chromatography market these days. And then secondly, any expectations you guys have for a budget flush in the fourth quarter?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure. I think, as -- everything in the hardware area and the life science market, I think the hardware business for chromatography is pretty flat right now. It's a little bit stronger than the mass spec piece of the marketplace, but I'd say that's a characterization of the global marketplace, strongest in China, strongest in traditional pharma applications, as I've said. I don't think that there's any indication of significant market share moves in this climate. We don't see it. We don't see major lost business or gained business. Times like this, it's awfully difficult, I think, to see any kind of significant market share move. In times of low demand, people tend to stick with what they've done. As things change or get a little bit more robust, I think you can look for a little bit more swings to new products and new dynamics, but I'd say there's not much change in the liquid chromatography market. Boy, maybe on the fringe there's some, but we can't see it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "You talked about strength in the generic customer base despite some challenges in India. I'm just kind of curious, what's going on there? What's driving the strength among the generics manufacturers?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think what's going on in generics is what you'd almost expect in India. That's one reason why we think it's inevitable for India to come back, because the generic marketplace is growing pretty robustly as ethical pharmaceuticals come off patent, and you're still seeing the business grow for something like LIPITOR that just recently came off patent and has now substantially gone generic. So the long-term flow of products into the generic market, I think, is unquestioned. What you're seeing is a specific dynamic in India with the rupee being very weak, with government policies in India not being terribly clear. So generic companies and regulatory snafus in Italy [ph] among some of the generic companies causing individual problems. So we think that's limited to India, but almost everywhere else, the generic business is pretty robust. So I think you're going to see India return. Whether it's 1 quarter out or 2 quarters out remains to be seen, but other than that, I think the conditions are still very good for the whole class of generic drug manufacturers.", "Operator", "Okay, we have no one left in the queue at this point.", "Unknown Executive", "Good.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Very good. Well, thank you, all, for being with us. We look forward to updating you on our next conference call. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to this Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters division; and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations. As is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter's highlights, and John will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the first quarter of 2013 and for the full year of 2013. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John A. Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will be making various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q1 and full year 2013. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, in Part 1 under the caption Business Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2013.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, Reconciliation of Net Income per Diluted Share included in this morning's press release.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Okay. Thank you, John. Well, 2012 was certainly a challenging year for Waters, especially in comparison to the stronger growth rates we enjoyed in 2010 and 2011. After a slower-than-expected start to the year, we recalibrated our expectations and continued to track at a pretty consistent organic growth rate through the following quarters. However, and as we have seen in previous periods of sluggish demand, pricing held up across our product line and we were able to control our expense growth. These factors were important in delivering stable levels of profitability.", "If you look at 2012 growth rates across our major product lines, we continued to benefit from newer core offerings in chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal technologies. Our recurring revenues, the combination of chromatography consumables and total instrument service sales, generated consistent growth in 2012 and contributed to our overall profitability.", "Pharmaceutical end markets were mostly stable across the year while many industrial chemical customers, given the weaker general economic conditions, held back on capital spending. Governmental and academic spending during the year, as might have been expected, was pretty soft.", "Geographically, we were pleased by the relative strength of our business in Europe. At the onset of the year, the concerns that instability in smaller European Union countries would spread across the continent appeared to have been somewhat overstated. And in fact, European pharmaceutical demand remains sufficiently strong to offset the somewhat slower sales to governmental and chemical consumers.", "Our business in developing regions was mixed during the year. Most importantly, growth in China remained robust off a strong 2011 performance. On the other hand, a convergence of issues hampered our performance in India. Our developing market businesses in Eastern Europe, South America and Eastern Asia delivered uneven results and cumulatively performed at levels weaker than we had hoped.", "There are some speculation that the potentially recessionary economic conditions in the larger consuming economies, principally Western Europe and the United States, limited scientific investment growth in the more fragile export-oriented countries. We are hopeful that an outlook for moderate but stable global economic growth in 2013 will result in a recovery of spending for analytical tools in many of these developing countries.", "On the competitive front, we feel the landscape remain relatively unchanged in 2012. At this point, nearly all companies offering liquid chromatography systems have acknowledged the momentum toward UPLC-type separations, and we feel confident that our leadership position will allow us to continue to direct future market developments and maintain a premier market share position. Our ACQUITY H-Class instrument system continued to bridge UPLC capability to classical HPLC applications.", "Also on the separations technology front, we launched our UPC2 system in 2012. An industry first of its kind, UPC2 has begun to establish a new performance category in analytical instrumentation that meaningfully improves workflows across many applications. In mass spectrometry, I believe we have established a performance leading position in tandem quadrupole technology, and sales growth for our Xevo TQ-S in 2012 suggests a strengthening market position. In applications ranging from clinical drug development to food safety testing, Xevo TQ-S offers a new level of sensitivity combined with high reliability and usability.", "In 2012, sales of our top base instruments declined in comparison to somewhat stronger 2011 results. However, recent business activity for instruments, such as our SYNAPT HDMS and Xevo QTof systems, has improved, and we are anticipating a return to growth in 2013.", "Our TA Instruments division performed well in 2012. For the full year, TA's constant currency revenues were up about 8%. Following a double-digit growth performance in 2011 and in light of global economic weakness, these results are pretty impressive. High points for TA in 2012 include the continued successful integration of purchased businesses into the TA portfolio and the buildout of a discovery line of thermal analyzers and rheometers. In 2012, TA also successfully acquired new product lines and technologies to expand their business into high temperature material characterization markets.", "Looking at the fourth quarter, our constant currency sales grew about 1.5%, and our adjusted earnings at a moderately higher level. These results were in line with our expectations and include both the adverse impact to margins from a recently significantly weaker Japanese yen and the positive effect of a lower-than-anticipated tax rate. For the Waters division, we saw growth in our pharmaceutical end markets, significantly driven by strong demand in Europe and China, a continuation of a dynamic that we saw in the third quarter.", "The global combination of government and university shipments declined at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, with weakness in academic demand most pronounced in Europe, Japan and in a few smaller countries. U.S. government and academic sales held up well with recent ordering trends suggesting stronger, high-end mass spec demand.", "Looking at our applied markets and focusing on food and environmental applications, we have a history of healthy but lumpy growth performance. In the fourth quarter, our global food and environmental growth was down in comparison to last year. However, the decline came as a result of strong growth in the U.S. market, offset by a more significant decline in Europe. We are encouraged to see more food testing uptake in the U.S. as we feel that this market represents a large future growth opportunity. In fact, within the last month, the U.S. Congress passed legislation sending a clear message detailing the importance of scientific training on advanced methods of analysis. This is certainly encouraging for Waters as we have actively assisted in developing such methods and training protocols in cooperation with global regulatory agencies.", "Our TA division finished 2012 with a strong fourth quarter performance, completing a year of profitable growth. In the quarter, constant currency sales were up 7%. TA's organic growth was primarily driven by continued global adoption of discovery thermal and rheology systems and generally strong international sales. High-temperature instrument sales also contributed nicely to the division's overall performance in the quarter, a trend that's promising for 2013.", "Looking at the Waters division fourth quarter sales geographically, constant currency sales growth in Europe was in line with the company's overall growth rate. European strength in biopharmaceutical markets was offset by weak academic and chemical analysis sales, including a decline in applied market instrument system sales against the tough prior year comparison. European pharmaceutical results included healthy spending from large global firms in the region.", "In China, our sales growth was strong and broad based in the quarter, with most major product and market segments growing at double-digit rates. The fourth quarter results in China complete a year of strong growth in a very important market for Waters. Our competitive position in China is strong, and our access to the most attractive analytical market segments within China is reflected in the sales growth and profitability we have delivered in the fourth quarter and for the full year.", "On the other hand, our sales in India were lighter than we had hoped as local currency weakness, recent drug manufacturing and CRO issues, combined with government inertia, have contributed to slower business momentum. We continue to believe that underlying demand for new instruments, primarily for generic drug manufacturers in India, remains strong, and we anticipate seeing improved ordering trends in upcoming quarters. We remain confident in being able to maintain a leading share position and know that in the long run, India is an important and attractive market for us.", "Waters division constant currency sales in Japan were moderately down in the fourth quarter as weaker industrial chemical results offset strong growth in our pharmaceutical business. We're cautiously optimistic that a recent weaker yen may stimulate more business in 2013 from our industrial chemical export-oriented customers in Japan.", "In the U.S., and staying on the Waters division performance, we saw the strongest growth in instrumentation for our applied markets, including food and environmental testing. A modest decline in shipments to pharmaceutical segments is largely accounted for by weaker sales to large accounts, interestingly, the same set of customers that grew nicely in Europe. Combination of government and academic business grew at a solid mid-single rate in the quarter, with increased business activity in the high-end mass spectrometry system.", "Now, I'll discuss some product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter. The growth in chromatography consumables was strongest in China and more moderate in most other regions. Sales growth of ACQUITY UPLC columns suggests a continuation of high attachment rates and of a gradual increase in UPLC technology and regulated methods. Our service business growth was more geographically balanced and close to a double-digit rate in most regions.", "Looking at our Waters division instrument system sales, performance was comparable for LC/MS instruments and LC instruments in the quarter, with moderate declines in sales in comparison to last year's results. For LC/MS, our strongest performing instrument systems embodied Xevo TQ-S mass spec technology combined with ACQUITY UPLC. This configuration is a workhorse tool for quantitative bioanalysis applications and drug development. And as I mentioned earlier, there are signs based on our recent ordering trends in the fourth quarter of 2012 and as we start 2013 that we are seeing improvements in our high-end top base demand.", "On the chromatography front, ACQUITY UPLC continued to edge into more QC applications. We believe that opportunity to see higher utilization of UPLC technology and QC application lies ahead of us. Up to this point, expansion into this segment has been limited by a combination of the 10-year length of the drug development cycle and by the somewhat restricted spending environment at most large pharmaceutical accounts. When drugs that are currently under development in labs that are using UPLC technology eventually make their way at volume production, we are confident that the preferred QC methodologies will transition to UPLC technology.", "Continuing on the chromatography front, 2012 marked the start of Waters' entry into a new separations technology that leverages the high resolving power of supercritical carbon dioxide in a high performance analytical format. We introduced our ACQUITY UPC2 platform at Pittcon 2012, and after receiving the Editors' Gold Award recognizing this system as the most innovative showcase at the conference, shipment volumes have nicely ramped through the remainder of the year. In 2013, we expect to see a positive impact of this system on our overall results, especially as UPC2 has the potential to improve analytical workflows at our customer labs while driving sales growth at Waters for not only new instruments but also associated growth in specialized ACQUITY columns and customer service plans.", "Well, so where do we go from here? In 2013, look for us to continue to introduce new application-tailored systems that offer more complete workflow benefits to customers. As you've seen for the past couple of years, you should expect that these systems will combine advanced mass spectrometry, ACQUITY UPLC and UPC2, our new unified operating system platform, application-specific separation chemistries and software applications. In addition, I expect that 2013 will be an exciting year for new instrument platform introductions. We have maintained a rich R&D product pipeline, and we look forward to significant launches at conferences this spring, which will showcase innovations in LC/MS and thermal analysis.", "In 2012, our sales and earnings growth rates were well below historical averages and our long-standing internal benchmarks. Though we are confident that generally weaker market conditions were responsible for our 2012 performance, we feel that these market conditions are temporary, and accordingly, we will maintain the same long-term internal growth targets for sales and earnings growth and manage our business to best achieve these long-term goals. We continue to believe that our technologically-focused business strategy and conservative asset allocation plan will continue to benefit our customers, employees and shareholders.", "Before turning it over to John, let me say that I am cautiously optimistic that 2013 will be a better year for Waters than 2012. Looking at the macro environment, the global economy appears more stable, and our outlook for business growth in nearly all geographic locations is positive. I'm also confident that our competitive position remains strong and that planned new product introductions will further enhance our competitive leadership position.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to John for a review of our financials and an update on the future outlook.", "John A. Ornell", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Fourth quarter sales were about the same as last year's, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 2% at $1.59 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.56 last year. However, on a GAAP basis, our earnings were $2 this quarter versus $1.51 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning. Our GAAP results this quarter contain a large tax benefit associated with recent tax planning activities that will allow us to access previously trapped net operating losses and apply them to future taxable income streams within our legal entity structure. This will result in reduced cash payments for taxes over the next several years than would otherwise have been the case. This benefit is calculated to be about $36 million and results in $0.41 of EPS benefit in our GAAP results. These benefits do not affect our non-GAAP earnings.", "Reviewing Q4 sales results in comparison with Q4 last year before foreign currency translation, sales were up about 1.5% and currency translation reduced sales by just over 1%. Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were down 3%, Europe sales were up 2%, Japan was up 1% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%. On the product front and in constant currency, within the Waters division, instrument system sales decreased by 5% and recurring revenues grew by 8% this quarter. Within the TA Instruments division, total sales increased by 7% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q4 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in at 60.1%, down modestly from Q4 last year. This decline was largely the result of currency translation as the combination of a stronger British pound and a much weaker yen increased our manufacturing cost and reduced our sales volume, respectively. SG&A expenses were down 1% as a result of net favorable currency translation, continued tight spending controls and lower variable compensation expenses. R&D expenses increased by 5% this quarter.", "On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate came in favorable to our earlier estimates at 15.2% for the full year. This reduction was due to a favorable shift in income among our legal entities. And for 4Q, the cumulative full year catch-up benefit of this change lowered our effective Q4 tax rate to 13.8%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6.4 million and share count came in at 87.9 million shares, 2.7 million shares lower than Q4 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.", "Looking at our earnings per share for Q4, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share contain a couple of unexpected items that largely offset each other. First, we had about $0.04 of foreign currency translation cost, about 1/2 of which is the result of rapid currency movements late in the quarter. And second, we had $0.04 of tax favorability resulting from the more favorable mix of legal entity profits discussed earlier. On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1,539,000,000 and debt totaled $1,178,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of about $361 million. As for Q4 share repurchases, we bought 720,000 shares of our common stock for $61 million. This leaves $643 million remaining on our most recently authorized share repurchase program.", "We defined free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. For Q4, free cash flow came in at $120 million after funding $18 million of CapEx. Excluded from the CapEx cited is $13 million of capital associated with our new U.K. mass spectrometry facility. We expect this facility to be ready for occupancy by the end of 2013.", "Accounts receivable, day sales outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up 6 days from Q4 last year. DSO was impacted by geographic distribution of our Q4 sales and does not indicate a change in the overall quality of our receivables. In the quarter, and as is typical for year end, inventories decreased by $17 million. So for the full year 2012, sales pre-currency effects grew by 2%, while currency translation reduced sales by 2%. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 2% to $4.93 versus $4.81 in 2011.", "Now looking ahead to full year 2013, we expect economic conditions to modestly improve as the year progresses. We believe our strong product lineup, coupled with a favorable base of comparison, should allow us to grow our constant currency sales for the full year around 5%. We generally use foreign currency spot rates when we calculate guidance, but given the extraordinary recent drop in the Japanese yen, we used the prior 30-day average exchange rate of JPY 86 to $1 in creating our guidance for Q2 through Q4. For Q1, we are using a spot rate of JPY 89 to $1. All other currencies were translated using current rates. Using these assumptions, full year currency translation is expected to be neutral to sales growth while depressing earnings per share by $0.10 in 2013 versus 2012.", "Moving down the P&L. Gross margins are expected to be about 59.5%, a modest decline due largely to the currency effects I just described. Operating expenses are expected to be up between 3% and 4% from 2012. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $26 million. We currently expect our full year operating tax rate to be about 15.5%. The expected tax rate will vary by quarter as we account for the R&D tax credit recently reinstated by Congress in Q1. Our tax rate in Q1 is expected to be approximately 14%, and for Qs 2 through 4, are expected to be about 16%. Our full year average diluted share count is likely to be around 85.5 million shares outstanding. Rolling all of this together, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40.", "As we think about our expectations for the first quarter of 2013, we expect organic sales growth of about 4% in the first quarter. Currency translation at today's rates will reduce sales by almost 1%, resulting in reported sales growth of about 3%. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.12.", "Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Operator, I think at this point, we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Doug and John, you've discussed throughout the call an increasing kind of tone of business possibly as, I guess, we exited the quarter. I think Doug, you talked about an ordering trend in high-end mass spec. Maybe if you could just flesh out a little bit kind of the pacing throughout the quarter that you saw and maybe some of this kind of forward visibility on improving demand trends.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, Dan. I think most of it's qualitative. And I caution everybody to say that it doesn't necessarily reflect longer term trends. We definitely saw an improvement in the fourth quarter in both the drop rate of high-end mass spec and more qualitative things, like demo requests and quotes. So that we see as positive. We see that continuing in the early part of 2013. We're also hearing what I call murmurings of improvement coming from our customer base. What makes it remarkable or notable is that it's different from what we were seeing at this time last year, which was much more cautious. So it's pretty much across the board that we're seeing those qualitative comments as being -- as leading to more optimism than pessimism. Does that cover your question, Dan?", "Operator", "We can go to the next question. Amit Bhalla of Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just 2 quick questions. I guess, number one, Doug, can you just talk a little bit about the outlook by regions and end markets for 2013? What's the underlying assumptions within the guidance you laid out? And then I have a follow-up question on India.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure, I'll ask John to lay it out. He's got the data right here.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, I think as we think about the full year and look at the geographies around the world, the expectation is that developing economies, largely Asia outside of Japan, portions of Eastern Europe, South America, Central America areas that we typically bring in to about the 30% that we talked about as being our emerging market exposure, we're looking for that to continue at kind of a high single-digit rate. We've seen that be better generally than that in actual results, but we tend to target something that's in the high single digits for those regions of the world. And then in areas such as U.S. and Europe, given the base of comparison that we have, we're looking for low single-digit growth this year in those parts of the world, maybe starting off closer to 2% and then closer to 3.5% perhaps. And then Japan, we're looking for a bit more of a difficult slog there, maybe 1% or 2% growth in that region. So that's kind of the outlook by geography.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And the end markets? And then I guess, I'll just throw in my India question. You had some pretty easy fourth quarter comps in the prior year. You're talking about some CRO issues. Can you flesh India out a little bit more in terms of the details of what's really happening there?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, I think what we've talked continuously about in India is that these customers are facing weaker rupee issues, wherein they're challenged by both the capital requests, as well as financing issues, that most of their debt's denominated in stronger currencies, and that challenges their ability to aggressively spend new capital. They've also had regulatory issues that have made them cautious in certain areas. We can pretty much look at almost every item that comes into India in terms of the market share dynamics, and we're convinced that there's no significant market share erosion going on in our business in India. So I know this is getting to be a little bit of a broken record; we're pretty confident that it's going to change. We're not happy that it's taken longer than we expected, but we think we'll see a change in 2013 and we'll see positive results in India.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And the question on the end markets?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, what was that question?", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "The original question was your underlying assumptions on geographies and end markets. I didn't hear anything on end markets.", "John A. Ornell", "We're looking at pharma to grow kind of in the mid single-digit range. It could be, maybe 6% -- so closer to 6% than 5%. Government and academic, kind of flat, maybe a modest amount of growth as we exit the year but starting off slow. And then the applied markets, including food, environmental, industrial, somewhere in kind of the 3% to 4% range.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The first one was just on UPLC. I'm wondering if you could maybe give us an update on where we are, and we're a few years into that product cycle, and wondering how you're measuring the penetration of that technology from an installed base perspective. And then maybe if you could offer some comments on what you're seeing on consumable attach rates.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, I think we're very happy with the penetration of UPLC in almost all the early stage R&D segments of our market. I will say that it's taken longer to penetrate, although we are beginning to see penetration in downstream applications, particularly in pharma, particularly in mainstream QC. We certainly continue to hear our customers talk aggressively about taking UPLC into those applications. But frankly, up until this time, it's probably been a little more talk than action. We think that has a lot to do with the fact that capital is tough to come by and that it's just tougher to get capital in those large pharma applications. It is true that we're seeing a lot of success in penetration of UPLC in the generic drug manufacturers, and we think that that's a continuing dynamic that will continue to benefit us. In terms of attachment rates, we're happy with the continued strong attachment rates of consumables even at this phase, many years down the track, that we continue to see very high attachment rates of the UPLC consumables. It is true that since we sell braces of these columns with a new instrument placement, that because of the decline in instrument placements that we saw during this year, that that certainly affected to some extent the initial flow of our UPLC columns. But they still held up very nicely in each application.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So if I can just clarify what you said, it sounded like you were saying we're still maybe not quite halfway through the upgrade cycle on the equipment. Just -- I didn't want to put words in your mouth, but just making sure that's kind of the way you're framing it. And then last one for me was on longer-term tax planning. John, I think you guys have said in the past you have a tax shield I think in Singapore that expires in the near term. Anyway, just plans on what you plan to do there to offset it?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, we're going to begin to look at options on that front that runs out 3 years or so down the road. So we'll start this year to think about what incremental product transfers maybe could be done to extend our benefit in Singapore. This -- we can think about what we might do in Ireland as well, incrementally from where we are today. The new product lines that we're developing on convergence chromatography might find a home over in those regions of the world. That might be a bargaining chip that we could use to move another piece of technology and gain something incremental on that front. So you'll hear more about that as we begin to work through that this year in anticipation of that benefit running out at the end of '15.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We think that we have any number of irons in this fire that will enable us to not see extraordinary increases on our effective tax rate even 4 or 5 years down the road, but those are actions that will play out in the next couple of years.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "John, you talked a little bit about the long-term guidance being in effect, and are you referring to the kind of 8% long-term top line and 15% bottom line internal targets that you set for yourself? And if so, what do you see changing about the current environment that would kind of allow you to get back to that level?", "John A. Ornell", "Well, I think we look at this year certainly as a transition year from a very low-growth environment that is really a point off the line, certainly, from a history perspective, looking at where we've been and where we think we're going. We look at the opportunity that we have with some of the new products that we currently have in our portfolio, others that are coming into play that we think longer-term will add to the growth rate. And we don't believe that the economic environment that we live in today is the one that we're going to live in for the future, 2 , 3, 4 years out. So we do think that we're going to come back to some level of moderating demand in various markets that affords us the opportunity to grow somewhere closer to that 7%, 8% top line as we exit this year and move into next year. So we believe that there's incremental application opportunities for these products, maybe in clinical. We look at the biologically synthesized drugs in the drug pipeline, and think that there's opportunities to, perhaps, overtime introduce mass spectrometry into the QA/QC applications, new food safety opportunities in the States. So there's a myriad of both potential market opportunities that we think longer term allows us to get back to those 7%, 8% top line-type growth numbers that typically have leverage to about 15% growth in earnings.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. We think pretty clearly that we're coming off a period of -- at least a year, maybe longer than that -- of some of the toughest macroeconomic conditions and some things that disproportionately hurt areas in our sweet spot. We just talked a lot about India, and India alone has cost us several points of growth in the last 1.5 years. So it's easy to kind of look at the well you're down at any particular point, and think the future's always going to kind of mimic that position. We think that for the most part, we're going to be coming out of these tougher market conditions and going into a more normal position, particularly more normal in some of our sweet customer spots.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Dan Leonard of Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Question on the gross margin guidance. Is there anything happening in the gross margin line besides foreign currency? I just would have thought that there would have been some more leverage off of a 5% organic growth expectation on the gross margin line.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, that's a good question. And there is one other item that we've highlighted, and that is, is that this year, we're beginning to ship the -- some of the fuller capabilities of our UNIFI software platform, and that is triggering the beginnings of meaningful amortization of capitalized software. So this year, we have about a $10 million to $11 million increment in costs associated with that amortization that's impacting the gross margins as well. Because, otherwise, we would have seen a little bit less of an impact overall in the margin. So between that $11 million and a very unfavorable yen, they combined to provide what's there on -- what I've described.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "That is a non-cash charge, but it still is reflected in our non-GAAP earnings.", "John A. Ornell", "Right, non-GAAP results. Right.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering what levers are available for you to pull at the operating line if things get off to a slower-than-expected start this year? I mean, I guess, I'm just thinking about SG&A as a percentage of sales being down about 180 basis points versus where you were into 2009. The rate of growth in R&D spend really moderated in 2012. You just talked about your longer-term expectations of 7% to 8% top line growth in response to Tim's questions. I guess I'm just wondering how much more you'd be willing to cut in 2013 if you get off to a slower-than-expected start out of the gates. And then conversely, are there areas you've identified where you'd really like to pick up the pace of investment if the year gets off to a better-than-expected start?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think -- let me say, Doug, that we have some ability to moderate our spending plans in the face of somewhat weaker conditions. I wouldn't have you believe that we can cut expenses dramatically in the face of a very significant shortfall on revenues. That's why we have looked very hard at our plan for revenue growth, and believe that we can get there because, of course, our spending plans have triggered off that revenue estimate. But we have some flexibility. We have some minor headcount plans, and we have compensation plans that can be tweaked to make up for some reduction. It would take a longer term -- if we see that the longer-term is more unfavorable than we currently believe, that would take us really considering changing the structure of our business. It's doable, but it would take a belief that we don't have right now about the longer-term health of our end markets and we think -- well, it's conceivable that it starts a little bit slower, we don't think that that's what we have in mind for the full year 2013. So -- and is there -- was there another part to...", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, areas that we might invest in. Was that the other piece, Doug?", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "That's right, John.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, we've never -- let me restate it. We think that we're investing at the proper pace, given the projects and the opportunities that we have and we don't -- we haven't cut out major projects in R&D in order to protect the bottom line. So within the normal give and take of projects and criticisms of plans and plans that are ahead of schedule and a few that are behind, we're reasonably happy with the mix of programs that we have. I wouldn't say really that if we had an extra $5 million to spend, there's something that crawls up onto the A list. I think we're pretty happy with what we've got going and yes, I suppose you could always use an extra $0.5 million or so. We're in pretty good shape.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just a quick one and then I'll get back in the queue. A quick one for John. Did you provide guidance specifically on your expectation for instrument versus recurring revenue growth this year? And if you did, I apologize for missing it. If not, would you provide that?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, I'd say you've seen relatively consistent growth in service and chemistry revenues across this year, being a very difficult year. So we see that pace continuing. So something in the kind of the 7%-ish range, all in, for those couple of businesses seems reasonable. And then the instrument piece maybe starts off just slightly slower at the start of the year, but for the full year is somewhere around kind of 3%, I would say.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Paul Knight of CLSA.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "On the food safety testing market that you mentioned was stronger, do you think that's due to the 2 rules out for review on the Food Safety Act? Or is it kind of business growth as usual and we might see acceleration later?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I don't think we've seen anything really coming out of the act yet, Paul. The -- it's still in its infancy, really, and it might be that in the end, it directs more towards imports and it has an effect outside of the U.S. as much as inside. So I think the full effect of that's going to come in the future. I don't think we've seen much impact of it so far.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Were you able to quantify how much food safety is of sales?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, how much food safety is...", "John A. Ornell", "What percent?", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Do you think food safety's 5%, 10% or what percent of sales?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "It's about 6% or 7% of sales.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Ross Muken of ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So I have 2 quick things. So one on the instrument line. The 3% number that you threw out there, John, basically sort of offset the weakness from this year and so, ultimately, the business would not be growing very much since '11. And so, I guess, you look back historically, most times over the course of the cycle, where you've kind of had a pull back in CapEx, we've sort of seen a reasonable recovery on that line in the following year. So I guess, what, other than sort of the macro, would make that not be true this time around, particularly given some of the comps you have on the generics business, which I'm assuming accounted for a decent amount of the weakness?", "John A. Ornell", "That is a good question, Ross, and I'll say there is potentially some level of optimism that could suggest that that turns out to be the case. I think, though, that as we start the year and think about a -- hopefully something, leaning towards conservative view of the world, coming up with a growth rate that really just brings us back to flat is probably a realistic point of view that maybe has a little more upside than down as the year goes on. But I think just from creating guidance and trying to provide a little more pleasure than pain when doing that, we just felt uncomfortable, suggesting that we were just going to bounce back all in the course of 1 year to do exactly what you're describing. I agree, if you look back historically at times when it's been tougher, almost always, the next year bounce back -- bounces back pretty meaningfully. But we're going to leave that potential as upside, and hopefully paint a view here that feels very realistic to begin the year.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "And Ross, I think it's also true that as you go down our organization, right down to the field level, you'll see much more of that attitude reflected in their expectations, and what they're driving to, that there's really a point of view that says this year could be significantly better. But when you roll it up through the levels of review and you look at the issues from macroeconomic disappointment, I agree with John. It's more prudent to enter the year on a more cautious plan than have to really gear it down later on.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, what was contemplated in the guidance for kind of the macro acceleration? The market as a whole seems a lot more optimistic, and you can argue we've gone through these the last few years. But I think there's some reasons to believe as long as you're up, sort of stabilized and China accelerates, we will see a better CapEx environment. So I guess, what did you actually factor into that forecast? Is it sort of 1Q trends and then a modest amount of improvement? I'm just trying to get the sense for how much...", "John A. Ornell", "I mean, we're basically saying that Q1 looks kind of like the last 4 quarters that we've seen, really not a lot of improvement coming right out of the gate. But I think it's fair to say that we think on the CapEx side, when you look at instruments, people will begin to feel better about spending capital as demand maybe improves a bit within their business, and maybe we see GDP in various regions of the world pick up a point or 1.5 points as the year goes on and we begin to see people feel better about spending CapEx. As we look at the operating side of what people do, we've seen relatively decent growth in our recurring revenues. We think that continues. It's the willingness of people to -- our customers to spend capital and we think that that gets incrementally better as we make our way through the quarters, but we're not factoring in getting back to normal, I guess, on that front.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "It's definitely true that one of the areas that we're most challenged on in 2012 was the industrial segment of the marketplace, particularly, industrial chemical firms, and that was true worldwide. Certainly, there's a case to be made for that segment of the marketplace to be stronger, and we also think we've got some dynamite systems coming onstream this year that addresses those customer needs. So if you compound that good feeling, you can get more enthusiastic than what we're willing to commit to now. But we're coming off a disappointing period, and it's still, I think, right to be more cautious at this point in the game.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Fine. One last thing. Just, John, remind me, the comp in India in Q1 versus what we just saw in Q4, how much easier is that?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, it was down meaningfully in Q1 last year. I don't have that specific number right in front of me, Ross, but the comp is definitely easier in Q1 than it was in Q4, and we're somewhat optimistic that we're starting off a bit better as we look at India coming out of the gate.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So could you just talk a little bit about the differences you saw in U.S. versus European pharma in the quarter? Also, just U.S. and European academic. And what, if anything, did you get from a budget flush this quarter?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "John, you want to...", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. Large pharma -- as we saw in Q3, the large pharma actually did better in Europe than they did in the states. We continue to see a little bit of bias at some of these accounts to spend money in Europe. So it was a little bit of a continuation of that trend. But I'd say between the two, we're not dramatically off from original expectation, and I wouldn't draw the long-term conclusion from what we've seen there. But overall, large pharma did about what we thought, but was, again, bias to Europe. I'd say government and academic really probably continues to do just a little better than we think, than we originally had thought. We really don't see these markets reacting dramatically to the fear of major budget cuts. I mean, when and if they come, and I'm sure we'll see them and life will be different. Fortunately, as you know, our exposure there isn't as great as it is in the space. But we really haven't seen any major reaction in government academic accounts at this stage that would suggest that they're acting ahead of time to cuts that may be coming their way.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And just one quick question, on the UNIFI system that you're launching. Can you just give us a recap on where you sort of are on the broad of that? And the -- obviously, you're capitalizing a lot of the software this year. But could you just give us a recap on that program, and what do you -- I mean, how do you think you see it driving growth?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure. I mean, as most everybody knows, UNIFI is really the culmination of a multi-year effort on our part that really brings all of the disparate software systems that we had in place under one operating system that we, of course, called UNIFI. This was a huge program, and we chose to introduce elements of it earlier. The first elements went in earlier last year with specific systems, particularly bioanalytical software. As we go through this year and into next year, we're really bringing the full chromatography and mass spectrometry elements of this system to the marketplace. So because only very small portions of it were introduced last year, you didn't see the full elements of the financial amortization. This year, as it comes into play, you're going to see that come through the P&L. I will say this is another area where I think we're being conservative in terms of the effect on our overall business because this is a major change in the facility of this software into our customers' applications, and we think, over time, this is going to have a dramatic impact and improvement. We're being cautious, once again, I think, about the early uptake and how it affects our business. But that's why you're seeing this come in a more significant amortization mode as we enter 2013.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Peter Lawson of Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Doug, just on India, what are the signs you're seeing for a better India, you think, for 2013?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, we're seeing earlier orders activity come to fruition, Peter. We continue to see -- to talk to these customers and to hear their plans, and they continue to be aggressive plans. So we see nothing that says -- if anything, here is one specific area where we think there's pent-up replacement [indiscernible] restrained activity in the past that should manifest itself in higher activities going forward. So in both the generic and in the food area, we're seeing much interest, much quote activity, and we've always believed that this market really is committed to the long-term servicing of the generic drug business, and see nothing that's going to move them on. As they come through this period, they'll resolve the currency issues. They're resolving the regulatory issues, and I think they're ready to move ahead.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And you don't think there could be any share losses during this period for you?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'm always unwilling to speak definitively about short-term market share dynamics, but India's one market where all of the equipment really comes in from outside the country, and that data is all public. So we monitor that kind of data, and see no fundamental changes in market share going on in our chromatography world.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And just one last question for John around the uptick in R&D in the quarter. I may have missed this. Is that just associated with the U.K. mass spectrometry coming online, and does that carry through for 2013?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, we have a lot of projects spent, and the project activities can move the needle in R&D a few points one way or the other. We've got the new UltraPerformance systems that are taking a little bit more effort in R&D. But I would say that, generally, it's project spent that can be lumpy quarter-by-quarter. Convergence chromatography is the product that we've traditionally spent some R&D dollars on. And we have a host of new products that we'll talk about as the year goes on that we're readying right now for Pittcon and in ASMS that are in a stage now that requires a bit more project spend as well. So it tends to be a little bit lumpy. I wouldn't draw that -- take that 5% and suggest that that's what it has to be into the next 4 quarters, but I'm comfortable thinking the expenses there is in that 3% to 4% growth range that I described earlier.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "But that's a little bit higher in 1Q. I guess that flows over into 1Q.", "John A. Ornell", "A little bit. The other thing to think about there is the British pound. There is some amount of translation that occurs there so you got to keep an eye on that. I don't know that it was a major impact in Q4, but we do have probably 1/4 to 1/3 of our spend that is in Manchester U.K. that does impact that line too.", "Operator", "Dan Arias of UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just on China, it sounds like things are continuing to be pretty strong there. Can you just touch on demand with respect to life sciences versus more industrially-focused work? How do things look there when you parse those 2 applications out?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, sure. China, interestingly enough, is a pretty balanced market for us. Whereas India is heavily weighted towards generics, China is more balanced between pharma, bio pharm, food and industrial. And our results in China have been strong in all of those, in both the overall pharmaceutical market and the applied segments. So we continue to see just very good growth across those segments.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe just a question on chemistry. Doug, you talked about the potential for some new LC introductions later this year. So I guess, how important is new column development to grow for you guys? And to the extent that maybe you do bring some new chemistries to market, should we think about there being any margin benefit to those aimed at more protein-based work? Or is that not really something that impacts profitability?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, chemistry is a very profitable segment of our business so it's always something that's worth noting. I do think that there's no significant platform introduction of a new chemistry this year. There are subsegments of our chemistry line, certainly, in our new UPC2 technology, and we have some new offerings in the life science arena, particularly dealing with peptides. There are probably things you'd consider niche offerings. Our whole chemistry line to some extent is made up of a bunch of profitable niches, so it's wrapped up in the numbers that John talked about. I don't think that I'd point you towards anything that's likely to move that needle tremendously in the chemistry area. It's the kind of thing where you wake up 2 or 3 years down the road and you've got a new $10 million or $15 million platform, but it takes a while to build.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Tycho Peterson of JPMC.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones. I wanted to go back to the comments you made earlier on the academic markets. You talked about them being fairly stable here. I know in the past, you've recently talked about potentially some share gains at the high end of the market, in particular, within this triple quad business. So in your assumptions here, are you factoring in some share shift? Or is it just more of general stability in the end markets?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Tycho, in the triple quad area, that's not typically the academic market. I mean, we're talking about the pharmaceutical and the applied markets that's the biggest segment for the tandem quadrupoles. The government and the university market tends to be more of the high-end top business that we're doing there, so...", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. Are you factoring share gains there though?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think 2012 in that high-end mass spec area was a tough time for us. We see that moderating a little bit in the fourth quarter and we think that that's a better place in 2013. Again, share gains are something that it's awfully fluid, but I think we're more confident about our business position and positive results in 2013 than we saw in 2012.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then on Japan, you talked about expecting a rebound there, I think, in part driven by currency. Can you just talk to the budget dynamics there? Obviously, in the March fiscal year, do you expect some budget flush this quarter? And do you expect any change in the academic funding environment there, post-March?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I would say we see -- we anticipate consistent dynamics against what happened in the prior year happening this year, but that's not for a robust growth in Japan. We do think that, consistent with the better economic expectations for the industrial markets, Japan has a significant industrial segment of the market. So as that becomes more competitive, we think that we'll do better. John, did you want to add anything to that?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, from the review that we had on Japan, I would say that the likely scenario is that we see a little bit better government budget in Qs 2 through 4 as they enter the next plan year, but nothing that moves us more than 1% in growth. So I mean we're looking at a business that might go from kind of flattish to up 1% or 2%. A lot of that's really just based on comparison.", "Operator", "Next question does come from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Just a quick question for me, either John or Doug, on this -- I want to make sure [indiscernible]. On the tax kind of restructuring that you announced, does that have any impact in your ability to repatriate cash and be more aggressive on your buyback?", "John A. Ornell", "No, unfortunately, this was a Europe restructuring. And while it creates some efficiency there and allows us to prevent tax payments from going up over the next 10 years, it doesn't have any bearing on the repatriation.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Sung Ji Nam of Cantor.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I just have a one quick one. Could you -- John, you talked about incremental growth opportunities in clinical diagnostics. Could you maybe talk about kind of what you're strategies are near-term and what your competitive advantages might be compared to others in this market?", "John A. Ornell", "Well, I would say -- we were talking earlier about the tandem quadrupole. That is an instrument that does fit nicely into this space. So I think we do currently have a very high performance offering out there. We've got a decent footprint that exists in that space. We have a crew here that are looking at potential incremental opportunities on that front. So I would say it is a sector we pay attention to. I think over the long run, there will be some interesting niche opportunities for mass spectrometry to do things that, today -- what chemistry tests are either inefficient or you have to wait too long for the answer. And we'll find some interesting applications over a longer period of time, and we continue to invest in that and think that we have a great offering and continue to -- we'll continue to deploy it this year and beyond.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, we're very optimistic about it. We had a good end of the year in our clinical business, and that might be one area where we see some unlooked for upside in 2013. We've got a lot of interest going using these new technologies in a clinical testing area, and we think that has a robust future.", "All right, operator, I think at this point, it's appropriate to bring it to a close.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded.  [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "As is our normal practice, I'll start with an overview of the quarter's highlights, and John will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John A. Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will be making various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q2 and full year 2013. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, in Part One under the caption Business Risks Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for July 2013.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share included in this morning's press release.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well, 2013 has started off pretty much as we had anticipated. Our demand for new instrument system has improved nicely from the trends we saw throughout last year and has returned to organic growth rates with strong free cash generation that are more in line with our historical performance. Though our reported sales and earnings per share were lower than we had forecast, the shortfall was entirely due to currency translation dynamics, primarily the significant weakening we've seen in the Japanese yen.", "Looking at the first quarter, our constant-currency sales grew about 5%. Our adjusted earnings per share were up 7%, and we generated strong free cash flow. John will review for you our financial performance in more detail momentarily.", "For the Waters division, our pharmaceutical end markets grew organically at a mid-single digit rate with strong sales in India and China compensating for slower capital releases among large multinationals. Global government and academic demand accelerated to a high single-digit rate based largely on successful mass spectrometry technology driven line. Outside of life science markets, industrial chemical and applied markets grew more moderately in the quarter.", "Geographically, the highlights in the quarter include a return to strong growth in India and the continued robustness of our business in China. The strength in China was broad based across the applications we addressed and looks to be sustainable in upcoming quarters. They're also expecting the strength in India to continue, as the local currency has stabilized and as production volumes for generic drugs ramp up and as CRO spending increases.", "Waters division constant currency sales in Japan were modestly down in the quarter with nearly all customer categories exhibiting somewhat lackluster demand. This weak demand compounded the adverse effects of the weakened currency. We remain encouraged that sales growth will improve in Japan during the second half of 2013, as governmental stimulus programs kick in and as exporting manufacturing companies start investing due to potentially stronger profits as a result of the weaker yen.", "In the U.S. and staying on the Waters division performance, sales were up mid-single digits. We saw our strongest growth in pharmaceutical and chemical analysis segments, while our government and academic spending were somewhat softer. The strength in pharma spending was largely from specialty clinical diagnostics and CRO customers. Spending from some of our larger pharmaceutical accounts shifted into the second quarter due to delays in capital budgets.", "In general, our developing markets in Latin America performed pretty well in the first quarter in comparison to mixed results throughout 2012. Our European business in constant currency for the Waters division was about flat in the first quarter, essentially in line with our expectation.", "Looking at customer groupings. European government and academic spending was robust in the quarter, while pharmaceutical and chemical analysis both saw modest decline. The academic strength was in part due to significant mass spectrometry placements for proteomics and metabolimics applications.", "Our TA division started off 2013 with a solid mid-single-digit constant currency sales growth quarter. Growth was largely driven by new technology products with high-temperature instruments beginning to have a more meaningful impact in the division's overall sales performance. These high-temperature systems, instruments that are used to characterize metals and ceramics, are sourced from businesses that TA acquired during the past couple of years and will continue to expand TA's application rate for years to come. Geographically, growth for TA was largely balanced across major markets.", "I now will discuss some product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, only grew modestly in the first quarter, as both our chemistry and service businesses were adversely affected by roughly 2 fewer selling days in the quarter and by, in the case of our service revenues, a tough comparison to a double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2012.", "Chemistry growth was a little weaker than we had anticipated even in light of the fewer selling days. However, ordering trends for columns and another chemical reagents have picked up early in the second quarter, and we anticipate that growth rates will normalize towards historical mid-single-digit levels as we move through this year. ACQUITY columns continue to account for an increasing proportion of our overall column business, and this trend is consistent with a steady uptick in UPLC adoption rates.", "Looking out at our Waters division instrument system sales. Sales growth was particularly strong for UPLC mass spec systems. All our major mass spec technology platforms, including QTof, tandem quadrupole and single quadrupole devices, grew at double-digit rates with strong uptake in pharmaceutical R&D application. This trend is very encouraging, as we can begin to see the couple -- the positive impact that our new UNIFI operating systems is having and driving advanced system offerings and enhancing our competitive position in the marketplace.", "On the chromatography front, we saw the strongest growth in orders for ACQUITY H-Class and UPC2 technology systems. H-class benefited from strong uptake when sold along with single and tandem quadrupole detection technology, while UPC2 adoption rates continued to steadily improve across a wide array of applications.", "In March at the Pittsburgh conference, customers were very excited to see a new advanced polymer characterization system called ACQUITY APC that we introduced at that venue. The ACQUITY APC system couples new size exclusion ACQUITY column chemistry with a tailored ACQUITY UPLC system that includes a new high-sensitivity refractive index detector. Developed in collaboration with researchers at Dow Chemical, this new system represents a long-awaited quantum step in analytical capability for researchers developing advanced polymer-based products. We expect to see sales growth impact from this system as volumes ramp up during the second half of the year.", "On the HPLC front, we saw consistent demand for our Alliance system. Alliance continues to be the workhorse system for generic drug quality control applications, and its consistent performance over many years has created a loyal customer base, a base fairly unwilling to change their purchase patterns. In that light, we have recently updated our Alliance system to ensure our ability to continue to manufacture and support this system for a number of years. The updated Alliance system offers performance that allows for seamless method transfer from earlier Alliance systems while providing updated electronics and improved industrial design.", "So what are the things in store for us going forward? Well, the simple answer is largely more of the same. In that, I mean stable top line growth, industry-leading profitability and cash flow, and a conservative capital allocation strategy.", "On the product front, expect us to continue to leverage the convergence of UPLC and mass spec technologies to create advanced UNIFI-based application tailored system. You will see examples of this that at ASMS later this quarter, as well as significant new MS innovations.", "On the M&A front, we'll continue to see smaller complementary technology opportunities that fit our profitability and growth characteristics. It is likely that we will see more activity on this front from our TA Instruments division over the next few quarters as more assets appear accessible.", "I'm confident that 2013 will be a successful year for Waters and that we will return to top line growth that's closer to our historical average rate, significantly better than what we saw last year during an industry-wide slowdown. Though we are not seeing economic conditions that suggest a robust recovery in the near term, we sense stability in the market. This market stability, in combination with the high degree of confidence that I have in our competitive position and in our technologically-focused business strategy, gives me confidence that we can perform well this year.", "Now here's John for a review of our financials and an update on our outlook.", "John A. Ornell", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. First quarter sales grew by 5% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 3%, resulting in 2% overall sales growth. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 7% to $1.07 this quarter compared to earnings of $1 last year.", "On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.39 this quarter versus $0.98 last year, and the reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning. Our GAAP results this quarter contain a onetime income tax benefit from an update of our reserves based on recent significant progress made towards closure in ongoing income tax examinations.", "As I just mentioned, before foreign currency translation, sales were up about 5%. Looking at this growth geographically and again, before foreign exchange affects, sales within the United States were up 6%. Europe was up 1%. Japan was down 2%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 5%. ROW sales growth in the quarter was strong.", "On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 8%, and recurring revenues increased by 3% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, total sales increased by 6% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q1 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in about as expected at 59.4%, down modestly from Q1 last year. As described in our prior guidance, we expect a modest decline in gross margin percentage across the year versus prior year as a result of a weaker currency translation environment and from additional software amortization from the release of our UNIFI products. Additionally this quarter, growth accelerated for our QTof-based mass spectrometry products, resulting in a mix shift that slightly reduced gross margin percentage and added to organic sales growth.", "SG&A expenses were up 1% as a result of currency translation and continued tight spending controls. R&D expenses increased by 8% this quarter.", "On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for Q1 came in at 12.6%, which contributed about $0.055 to earnings benefit this -- to our results this quarter versus our prior expectation. Our tax rates to Q1 is lower than our anticipated full year tax rate because it includes the R&D tax credit for 2012 that was reinstated in early 2013. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be between 15% and 15.5%.", "In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and share count came in at 87.2 million shares, 3 million lower than Q1 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.", "On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1,590,000,000, and debt totaled $1,233,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of about $357 million. As for Q1 share repurchases, we bought slightly over 1 million shares of our common stock for $95 million. This leaves $548 million remaining on our most recently authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.", "For Q1, free cash flow came in at $113 million after funding $18 million of CapEx. Excluded from this CapEx amount is $12 million of spend associated with our new Manchester, U.K. mass spectrometry facility. We expect this facility to be ready for occupancy in 2014.", "Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 80 days this quarter, up 3 days from Q1 last year. And in the quarter, as is typical early in the year, inventories increased by $7 million.", "Now thinking about the remainder of 2013.", "We had slightly stronger organic sales growth to start the year, and current business conditions look to support a continuation of this mid-single-digit growth trend. On the currency translation front, there has been a general weakening of major foreign currencies versus the dollar, with the Japanese yen leading the way with more than 10% depreciation since the start of the year. Updating our guidance for current translation rates now results in a 2% headwind from currency translation for the full year.", "Moving down the P&L. Gross margins are expected to be about 59.5%, a modest decline due largely to currency translation and software amortization dynamics I discussed earlier. Operating expenses are expected to be up around 3% from 2012. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, and we expect our full year operating tax rate to be between 15% and 15.5%. Our full year average diluted share count is likely to be around 85.5 million shares outstanding. Rolling all of this together, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.25. This is $0.15 below our guidance from January and reflects the adverse impact of foreign currency translation at today's exchange rates.", "As we think about our expectations for the second quarter of 2013, we expect organic sales growth to continue to be in the mid single digits. Currency at today's rates would reduce sales by about 2%, resulting in reported sales growth of about 3% to 4%. This brings non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23.", "Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. I think, operator, at this point, we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken of ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So on -- it seemed like one of the stories for the quarter was sort of a recovery in instrument growth. And I know you had an easing comp there, but it seemed to be even better than most of us were looking for. And so if you sort of had to tease out, as obviously it seems like more broadly, CapEx demand is sort of soft, if you need to tease out sort of market growth, new instruments, maybe the benefit from India, sort of the different components of what sort of drove you better certainly than the market but even sort of better than forecasts, how would you sort of weigh that out amongst the different pieces?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, it's again, hard to totally characterize what's going in the market for one quarter, Ross, but I think the significant dynamics for us was a quite strong mass spec business were pretty much all over. So we saw good strong results across every mass spec platform: the tandems, the high-end SYNAPT, QTof line and the single quads. We also saw a return to growth in India. Now it's been a while coming, but we finally saw a return to significant growth in India, and we've seen a continuation of very strong business conditions in China, and our results there are probably stronger than most. The U.S. held up pretty well in the quarter, and Western Europe was soft but not softer than we had anticipated. So I think that all rolled up into a stronger capital position than certainly we've seen through most of 2012.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And on the margin line, it seems like all of the sort of issue you've had on pull-through is sort of currency related. I mean, I know it's hard to react to sort of short-term changes, but it seems like given the commentary, particularly on Japan, we're going to be in for a period of weak yen now for a while. I mean, is there anything you can do to sort of mitigate that? I know you don't have a lot of cost base in that region, and I'm not suggesting hedging. But on a medium-term basis, do you think about sort of shift [indiscernible] the region? Or is there anything you could do to basically offset some of that? Or we'll just have to live with the incrementals for the year as long as the yen is weak?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, our forecast anticipates that we live with it for the year. within Japan, it should be noted, our Japanese business is a very profitable business. So even at JPY 100, this business continues to operate very profitability for us, just not as profitable as it was, of course, at JPY 80. And we don't do any manufacturing in Japan, and we don't intend to. So all of our revenues in Japan, except for the locally-sourced service and administrative costs, are exposed to the yen. That's why the flow-through to our bottom line is so significant coming out of Japan. Whereas in Europe, we do a lot of manufacturing in Manchester and in Ireland. So we mitigate the -- we're more balanced in terms of our costs and revenues in Europe. So what we could see is if the stronger organic revenue continues for the year, it's conceivable that, that will be higher than our current forecast, and that might lead to a mitigation of the yen situation. But we have no intention of now locking in the yen at JPY 100. We're much better, over the long term, managing in this currency environment, and we'll modify our long-term budget and strategic plans. But within a year, it's very difficult to offset this kind of currency move.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to start with some customer -- kind of deeper dive. Starting with large pharma, Doug and John, maybe can you comment on how much of a drag the slower release of budgets in the first quarter was on your business and kind of what did large pharma grow in the quarter and how you're thinking about kind of full year growth from that customer base?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. I -- just thinking qualitative terms, Dan, it's a combination of what we think of slow budgets and maybe a little calendar effect. It was an unfortunate timing of Good Friday, and we clearly saw some large orders from big pharma that we thought would be in the -- late in the quarter that we've subsequently seen flip into the second quarter of the year. So we have specific evidence of that, and we have what we think of as being a somewhat encouraging qualitative feedback from many of our large pharma customers concerning their plans. And in fact, early on, we've seen some of that materialize. So there's some evidence of it. We're not taking it all to the bank. But we think the combination of those dynamics probably means that the first quarter, maybe the rest of the year is a bit stronger in that environment than we saw in the first quarter. John, do you want to comment at all about large pharma?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I would just say that generally speaking, pharma all in grew mid single digits. It did well, and that's in spite of a drag that we're talking about with large pharma. So I think most of that, as Doug said, is really just a lag in the release. As we said, we had a very good start to the second quarter with that group of customers, so it doesn't appear to be a full year dynamic.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then maybe just kind of sticking with the customers. Could you kind of update us on how you're thinking about academic, government, industrial kind of growth throughout the year? I mean, certainly I get that academic and government you said grew high single this quarter and industrial sounds like it was -- kind of maybe grew modestly. How are you thinking about the remainder unit for those 2 customer bases?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I think on the government, academic side, the good news is, is that we have a pretty diverse worldwide clientele of customers. The U.S. wasn't certainly as robust as our customer base in Asia, for example. So all in, we had a really good year or a good start to the year with government, academic. A significant shipment of some high-end mass spectrometry products within Europe to some of those customers as well helped. So I would say, we're certainly above where we thought we'd be for one quarter. Maybe instead of a flat for this group customers, there's a modest amount of growth as we make our way through the year. But we're certainly off to a good start and better than we would have said as we entered the year. On the industrial side, I would say that we're not meaningfully off of our original expectation. That still grew at kind of at 3%, 4%, so it wasn't as low as you might think. We're pretty optimistic as we look at the product offerings that we have, the new APC, the TA Instruments offerings that will extract our share of business from the group of customers as well. So I wouldn't say we're concerned about even the industrial chemical side of the business at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Knight of CLSA.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Doug, it's the most bullish you've been on having TA move on acquisitions. What's creating that level of, I guess, heightened interest on your part?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, Paul, a lot of it is that we keep looking hard there. I mean, we've got a confident, aggressive management team, and they kind of fit our mold of being in our sweet spot of revenues that range from $5 million to $20 million, businesses that can easily fit within the infrastructure of the TA division and probably a little more interest at this stage in the year on a number of these fronts than we've seen. So it may be making a little more progress. So I could be embarrassed, and by the end of the year, we might not have secured the fronts that I think we're working well on. Our forecast, of course, doesn't include any of this. But I feel better at this point in the year about making progress there than probably I have traditionally, Paul.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Yes. And then lastly, I know NIH is a small part, but could you tell how that market was in the quarter and your projection of it?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think probably, like everybody, we think sequestration hurt a bit. The U.S. market in that -- in this area wasn't strong for us. But the timing of NIH type of procurement can also be a little hard to read. So it wasn't good, and we're anticipating that it's going to be on the soft side for the rest of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen  and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "My first question is does your Q2 guidance assume that you captured the revenue you missed out on in Q1 due to the delay in the release of capital budgets? And has a portion of that or maybe even a significant portion of that amount already been recorded?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, Doug, I think it's fair to say that we're optimistic that the second quarter returned some of those revenues that we anticipated in the first quarter. It would also be fair to say that our guidance tempers, to some extent, and doesn't necessarily include the fact that, that will stick for the full quarter. We're -- we like to be a little conservative on this front because it's not impossible that we see an end of the quarter flip from the second quarter into the third quarter also. So we try to draw a midline between those expectations. I think it means that we're more secure in this forecast, but it doesn't mean that we have necessarily included a large batch of those orders. I think of it as more...", "John A. Ornell", "Insurance.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, insurance than it is largely reflected in our forecast.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And if they were already booked, it would be more than insurance. Is that a fair observation?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. But again, there's no guarantee that some of the things that we then anticipate at the end of the quarter couldn't flip into the next quarter. So we're feeling good, but we're not going to totally take it to the bank yet.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And one area of clear investor focus recently has been on the pacing of the quarter, specifically what happened in March based on some commentary from other companies. Anything notable or surprising? It doesn't seem like that was the case, but just to be clear, would you guys talk about whether you saw anything abnormal as a result of the sequester in March, and more broadly, in some of your cyclical end markets?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Doug, I'd say the only thing that the end of the quarter saw was the timing of Good Friday in our more religious areas of the world. It fell on the last day of the quarter, and we have some reasonably good evidence that, that, probably combined with capital releases in large pharma, swung some timing of orders into the early part of the second quarter. I'd say the only other quarterly dynamic that we're seeing reverse is this whole issue on the consumables side. We've seen a curious dynamic on the consumables side being a slow start to the year. This isn't the first time, but this was a more unusual dynamic where we saw a very soft consumables business, largely, throughout the first quarter, and that seems to have turned very rapidly in the second quarter. And that may be uncertainty on the part of some of these large customers. It could be inventory management. We think that that's a onetime quarterly dynamic and have some pretty good evidence that it's already started to turn. So that's the only, I'd say, calendar type of dynamic, as well as 1 to 2 fewer selling days in the first quarter on the consumables front.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And last question, really, a good quarter from an operating standpoint, especially when you adjust for FX. That said, SG&A grew, I believe, less than 1% year-over-year on about 5% constant-currency revenue growth. And this was against a pretty favorable comp at the SG&A line and follows 3 quarters where SG&A spend declined about 3% to 4% relative to the previous year. How sustainable is this? I assume you get some natural hedge as a result of FX, but beyond that, can you maintain SG&A at these levels moving forward?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. I think from a model perspective, Doug, we've got about a 3% growth all in for the remainder of the year, and there are certain areas of the world that are going to require some level of investment as sales growth is in the double digits in those regions. As we've always said, we hold back as we start the year in making those types of investments to be sure that we are comfortable with the trajectory that we see. So I think there'll be a modest lift in SG&A as we make our way through the next few quarters. They could be -- there's little flexibility in that, but I would say we've been somewhat stingy in releasing some amount of expense in some of these regions where it's needed, and you're going to see that creep up a little bit as we make our way through the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So one just maybe high-level one, you obviously were seeing some more consolidation taking place in the sector. You guys aren't small, but maybe smaller than some of your peers. And just any sort of updated views you might have there especially as you think about trying to expand into newer areas such as more than [indiscernible]...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, Vamil. Could you -- you faded at the end of that question. Could you repeat it, please?", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, sorry, just in terms of some of the consolidation that's taking place, if you have any updated views regarding the -- just your size relative to some of your peers, especially as you think about moving into some of the more clinical end markets. With some of your technologies, how do you see your position versus some of these bigger peers now?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Oh sure, it's probably a timely question. I think, clearly, you can look at maybe segregating business strategies in the life science tools area broadly into 2 categories. One group of companies who drive their strategy believing that they can get economies of scale and drive their business through acquiring like businesses and driving more business through their distribution organization versus companies kind of what I think clearly Waters is that focus on the needs of a smaller set of customers, with a smaller set of technologies and try to optimize that to benefit the customers and focus kind of exclusively in those areas of their expertise. Obviously, not a perfect cut between those, but I think you can characterize companies as falling in either one of those sets. I think the companies that are focused on the former, on the distribution side, are characterized by lower growth rates, lower growth in organic earnings and lower return on invested capitals than companies like us that have focused on the specific needs of the customers set, hone their business, manage their capital spending to a finer degree. Waters has competed, over the 30 years that I've been involved in the industry, most of the time, competing with larger companies that have multi-technology arms and arms that have competed with one another for capital. And we've come up pretty well on that score. So I don't think that there's a whole lot of evidence that suggests that there are unusual returns to scale in this industry. Granted, you have to be competing in a marketplace that's big enough to support your organization, but the chromatography in the mass spec markets are amongst the most sizable in our industry and offer continuing opportunities for us to provide our shareholders with above-average returns. So I guess that's how I'd answer it.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "That's helpful to hear. And then just one other one. I know it's a little bit early in terms of ASMS coming up in a few weeks now. Any kind of insights you can provide regarding what we should expect? Is there anything you're looking at as big sort of pivotal meeting? Or is it more sort of incremental advances [indiscernible]?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think, at this point, we're not prepared to announce the ASMS. But we'd encourage you to go, and I think it's -- it will be a rewarding show.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Amit Bhalla of Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Doug, on consumables, when you talked about the potential impacts that you saw in the quarter, you didn't discuss competition. Anything on the competitive front that could be impacting the consumables side?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We don't think so. It's a little bit of a head scratcher. And in that particular area, there's -- it's highly unlikely that a new product offering moves things very fast, and we certainly have not seen that. We think it's totally a combination of calendar dynamics and an unusual slowness in customer activity early on. In places like China, you could see unusual quarterly dynamics where they place their year-long chemistry orders in a lumpy pattern, and we certainly saw some of that during this quarter. So I don't think there's much of a competitive dynamic here, and I think the short amount of evidence that we've seen so far in the second quarter supports that assertion.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then on China, I mean, robust performance overall. Can you give a little bit more detail by the end markets in terms of performance?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think the very encouraging thing about China is that it's broad based. It's across the traditional life science applications, as well as food quality, food safety and industrial applications. So boy, I'd say, if anything, we see the underlying dynamics in China strengthening a little bit rather than softening, and it's broad based.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And if I'd just sneak a quick one at the end, you mentioned in the prepared comments about Alliance and the stickiness there. As you continue to manufacture more Alliance system and demands there, what is the impact on pricing and gross margin for the business?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Nothing I said should lead you to believe that there's a significant pricing dynamic or gross margin dynamic. The new Alliance is largely an update of the old Alliance. It doesn't really significantly change the pricing of the margin dynamics.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So Doug, if I look at -- just to make it clear, what are you assuming for your exchange rates now for the rest of the year? I think initially, you have the yen at JPY 86?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, we're assuming at current rates of JPY 99 now for the yen, and the others are just about where they were, the big difference being the fact that, obviously, the yen has depreciated meaningfully across the quarter.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Yes. So John, if I look at that, it looks like pretty much if I do that math given where you were and where it went to, it looks like pretty much all the EPS revision is driven by the new yen expectation, so you're basically not assuming better organic growth to offset any of that.", "John A. Ornell", "That's correct. I'd say right now, we're looking at a mid-single-digit growth expectation comparable with what we said in Q1. Yes, we did come in a little bit better to start the year. That's encouraging. We're talking about new products and opportunities that maybe makes that a little bit better, but I think it's just a little too early in the year to think about moving that number up at this point.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay, I just wanted to be clear. And then on the R&D line, was there -- that group quite a bit obviously, as a percent of sales year-over-year, is there a -- is that just an anticipation as you were mentioning ASMS? Or is there anything in particular going on there?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. It's virtually timing. We have a fair number of project-related expenses on that line, so a fixed base of labor, they're sizable, but the project spend can move that number up and down a few points a quarter. And in this quarter, we had a few new mass spec products that required some [indiscernible] units. And so the project expense timing of that was a little bit skewed towards the first quarter versus what you'll see for the rest of the year.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "That growth rate moderates over the year, John.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Right. So your comment of the 3% was a total OpEx number, right?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Correct.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then, Doug, this is for you. If you look over the last couple of your years, your net cash position has been building up quite a bit. Is there any reason that you can't be more aggressive there, do a larger buyback, get more to a net debt position? I know you mentioned some smaller acquisitions in TA, but I mean, maybe what's kind of the strategy there?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. Well, the net cash position, John, is largely driven by the offshore dynamics of our profitability, and so like a lot of technology companies, if we remit those earnings from offshore, then we're faced with a large U.S. tax burden. So our tendency is to keep those funds invested offshore. And to the extent that we don't generate enough local cash to support the buyback or our capital acquisitions, then the debt markets are more than adequate to support those needs. So it's a balance between those 2 that you see reflected in our balance sheet.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "But so is -- in U.S., are you kind of bouncing up against some of your covenants in terms of the U.S. cash flow that you're generating to -- in order to be able to borrow more or to do more of a buyback?", "John A. Ornell", "No, not at this point. We are careful to ensure that the pace of the buyback that we do year-by-year affords us enough headroom as the business grows to be able to continue that type of trajectory of share repurchase. So thinking that today, we might go out and do another $0.5 billion buyback one time and push up against the ceiling isn't something we want to do. The message we want to send is that we have a very consistent program that allows us the opportunity to spend $300 million, $350 million on a consistent basis each year and not bump up against those covenants. And you'll probably see us expand our revolver as the year goes on to ensure that we maintain headroom in that lending facility.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Security.", "Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I guess one of the themes in 2012 was some pressure at the high end of the mass spec market. I'm certainly not getting that sense today. So has that eased? And if so, why?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We've definitely seen an improvement in our business at the high end of the mass spec marketplace. I think -- and we've seen it significantly in proteomics and metabonomics applications. It is coincidental with some technological improvements that we made in a number of those product lines which we have anecdotal support from our customer base concerning the benefit of those changes. So I think it's a little bit better marketplace, a better product offering that we've seen. It also comes together with the fact that the entire mass spec product line is operating very strongly right now. So it is noticeable. I do think it is a point -- we saw beginning of this in the fourth quarter and a strong continuation as we go into 2013.", "Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then just one other quick -- real quick, the -- you talked about your expectation for stability and the continuation of the positive trends that you've seen in Q1 from the organic growth side. That seems a little bit different than some of the macro data points. We're getting some weaker PMI numbers in even this morning. When you talk about the stability, what are you looking at? Are you looking at orders in hand? Or are you looking at macro variables?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We're looking at a combination of all those, Tim. I mean, we're looking at the -- a rolling average of our run rates in areas that have been indicative of the future. We're looking at our major geographies and looking at kind of what we call the drop sheets of customers that have asked for quotes, asked for early order indications, indicated interest in our new technologies. And in our biggest geographies, with the U.S. operating a little bit on the positive side, China operating on the very positive side, India returning for -- off of a period of very low growth with the opportunity to see pent-up replacement demand, I think traditionally, the overall GDP numbers in our areas don't correlate terribly well with Waters' individual growth dynamics. Obviously, we're not immune from economic activities we saw in 2009. But if you'd cast out those outliers, our individual markets are a better indicator than the overall GDP numbers. And we continue to be reasonably optimistic about what we're seeing in our individual markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First off, on x U.S. markets, wondering if you could maybe elaborate on Japan and India. In Japan, just wondering how you're looking at the impact of potential stimulus opportunities there as we move into the second and third quarters. And then in India, can you maybe quantify the magnitude of improvement that you saw this quarter? How much of that was easy comps versus just an underlying improvement in the demand picture?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think the India question, Isaac, is you can't ignore the fact that we didn't have a great year or quarter last year. So we did a little bit better than 2 years ago if you want to put it that way, but I wouldn't say that you're on a robust growth dynamic compared to 2 years ago. But it's still good off a baseline. We still think that there is some pent-up replacement demand in India, and we're encouraged about what those customers are saying, given the current state of the rupee and given the current state of regulatory hurdles in India. So we think that this kind of high teens kind of growth rate level for India looks sustainable. It in no way kind of is a quantum leap off 2 years ago, but it's good to see growth in that environment. The Japanese -- I -- we agree with you that we think stimulus spending can improve the situation in Japan as we go through the year. The stimulus amounts are very clearly aimed partly at customers in our segment. So we think our forecast accounts for a little of that, but we're not going to take it all to the bank until we start seeing those orders begin to roll in.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got you. That's very helpful. And then just on TA, one more question there regarding your comments on M&A opportunities. You said that there are more assets available. I'm just wondering why that's the case now. I would think that competition is higher just given the low cost of debt and the lack of growth that a lot of companies are seeing, so just wondering if you think it's an issue where you're more willing to deploy capital there given your cash generation in your balance sheet. Or is the situation where you're seeing more willing sellers for some company-specific reasons?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think it's probably more that just we've been so active in that area, and in our world, there are more opportunity -- more niche opportunities in that physical properties segment of the marketplace. Whereas in chromatography mass spec arena, there are much larger companies who are more established. And I think in some of these cases, you're looking at companies that are run by older management teams who are ready to perhaps move along. It's a -- it's not a homogenous set of companies that we're looking at. There are different dynamics driving a number of them. So it's hard to characterize them with a broad brush.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Leonard of Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "I was just hoping to get a better idea of how the weaker yen impacts profitability, and my question's a 2-part one. You mentioned that Japan is still very profitable at $100 yen (sic) [JPY 100] . I'm wondering if it's still above the corporate average of JPY 100? And if that's the case, when does it fall below? Is it JPY 105? Is it JPY 110? And then secondly, is it correct to assume that the lion's share of your year-over-year gross margin decline in the quarter, that the lion's share of that was yen as opposed to the software amortization?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "John, you want to start on that?", "John A. Ornell", "Sure. The Japanese business, even back at JPY 115, was a very profitable business and not a meaningful drag even at that level on the business. So it's the change year-over-year that gets our attention. But when you look at the absolute dollars of profit coming from that business at JPY 100 translation, it's still a very profitable business.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "It probably has to get north of JPY 115 to start dropping at below corporate average.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, exactly.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second part of my question is that...", "John A. Ornell", "Exactly. And this will lead to a gross margin -- this -- it's probably a 50-50 split. I mean, it's a meaningful amount of amortization. We're ramping up sales particularly early in the year on those products. So you're having a bit more of an impact to start the year than finish the year. The yen will be more of an impact on margins as we make our way into the second quarter and through the fourth quarter as the yen started closer to JPY 90. It ended up closer to JPY 100 in the first quarter, so you didn't have a full quarter impact. So that mix will change a little bit as UNIFI sales ramp up as time goes on and as we feel the full impact of the yen on margins Qs 2 through 4.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Peter Lawson of Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Doug, quickly, on the chemistry and reoccurring business, what gives you the confidence that it kind of gets back to a normalized growth level for the rest of the year?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, partly, Peter, we've already seen the dynamic change early on in the second quarter. We've also looked at the order patterns region by region and have become more confident that some of the lumpy order patterns for large chemistry orders in places like China where you don't have the kind of traditional onesie-type of orders. You see much more bulk ordering in those territories. And we saw an unusual dropoff and then a quick pickup. So it's -- and we've looked at the competitive offerings. We've looked at the other dynamics that could change it, and we don't see -- we're not anticipating robust sales, but we're pretty confident of the return to the mid-single-digit chemistry dynamics that, in even a depressed year, we think we can return to.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And the software amortization, why is that an issue now? Why wasn't that anticipated at beginning of the year? Is it [indiscernible] ...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Oh, no, no.", "John A. Ornell", "It was.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "It was anticipated. So the deltas I'm talking about weren't deltas from the guide. It was from last year. So we did anticipate that and talked about it coming into play right at the start of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. Just 2 real quick questions. So I know you don't have a ton of overlap in terms of your end market customers with Shimadzu and Hitachi, but have you seen any change in the competitive dynamic in -- with your Japanese competitors now that the yen has gotten a little bit more in their favor?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I don't think, in a broad way, we've seen the much difference, Derik. The Japanese haven't changed their spots from when the yen was JPY 120 to when it was JPY 90. They've always tended to be low-priced competitors, and we haven't seen -- I think they may be taking this opportunity to enhance their own P&Ls rather than think that a further low-priced strategy is going to do much for them.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I mean, that's consistent with what we've heard from some other companies. And just one other follow-up, I guess on the applied markets, you mentioned that growth there was a little bit more modest. Can you elaborate a little bit on this? Was this in food? Was this -- I'm just curious in terms of what you're seeing there because that's been such a big driver.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "No. Food actually was reasonably good. It was environmental applications. In some of the industrial chemical applications, we're probably more on the soft side.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So you're including industrial chemical on that one. Okay, great.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones here. As we think about kind of the back half of the year, are you able to just give us a sense as to some of the -- how we should think about some of the new products tracking, in particular the advanced polymer chromatography that you talked about at Pittcon earlier this year?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. That product is likely, Tycho, to be a rather modest sales product across the second half of the year. It's a rather limited set of customers. There'll be meaningful interest from the Dows, the DuPonts, the 3Ms and the like, but it's not going to add a point of growth as we look at Q3 and Q4. As time goes on and the product ramps up, maybe we get a little more juice from that, but it just isn't a market that is likely to create a meaningful top line dynamic in the second half of this year.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "What could be much more significant is the UPC2 that got a -- we got a little bit of momentum from late in last year but really is building momentum as we go through this year. So I think the UPC2 could be a much more significant dynamic than the APC.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And on UNIFI, can you talk about how we should -- you think about tracking the success of that business? Are you able to give us a rough sense of how many customers you have today? And I think in your comments you talked about kind of pulling through instruments sales with that as well, so...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. I think, you've see most of the dynamic, at this point, on UNIFI coming from tailored systems. UNIFI has not launched in terms of its overall chromatography network-based systems. But it clearly, with the launch of UNIFI into the high-end mass spec systems, this has been clearly partly what drove the enhanced position in the first quarter. We've see clear evidence of that. But I think that the beauty of UNIFI is that as you go through this year and into next year, more and more of the broad-based chromatography and mass spec applications come under the UNIFI umbrella and offer significant upgrade opportunities, as well as competitive advantages in many of these applications.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one, did you quantify the delayed pharma orders? I know you've talked about in a number of questions here, but did you actually quantify that?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "No, we didn't. It's multi-million dollars but less than $10 million.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sung Ji Nam of Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing trends, specifically for the mass spec business.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, I lost the last part of that. Could you repeat the question?", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Yes. Pricing trends for the mess spec business?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'd say they're nothing noticeable in terms of changes in pricing trends in our mass spec business. You can see it, our margins have been the same. Certainly, not major price increases, but no significant changes. Yes, stable prices I think is probably the way to characterize it.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then lastly, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about if there are any updates to your -- how you look at the diagnostic, clinical diagnostic opportunity in the medium term and if there are any updates there.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We're still very optimistic about the diagnostic opportunities. We continue to invest both R&D and early-stage marketing. And -- but I wouldn't say that we have anything to report on any major breaking news on the diagnostics front. But we continue to be encouraged about the long-term applications of LC/MS in the diagnostic marketplace.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Just regarding the improvement in mass spec you've seen, it sounds like it was with some European government customers. I guess, is that something that wrapped up in the first quarter? Or did that -- is that going to fall over to quarters over the remainder of the year? And I know when we talked a couple of months ago, you were expecting instrument growth this quarter be kind of closer to flatfish versus the 8% you did. So I was wondering what kind of changed or came in better versus what you guys were initially expecting a few months ago?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "No, I don't know what you mean by flattish, Steve. We're anticipating that the strength in mass spec continues more or less on the trajectory that it's on. So we don't see any competitive dynamic or market dynamic that changes the current momentum in the mass spec world.", "John A. Ornell", "I think QTof certainly was stronger in the quarter than we anticipated. We thought that mass spec, in some total, was going to do well, largely driven more by the triple quadruples than the high ends. So the high end did do better, but as a group of products, we thought that mass spec would do well, and it actually did a little better than that to start the year.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Operator, I think that will probably be an appropriate point to end the conference call. We've now been over an hour. So I think we'll just thank you all for participating, and we look forward to updating you on our next call.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q3 and full year 2013. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.", "For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, in Part 1 under the caption Business Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled earnings release, conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2013.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share, included in this morning's press release.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well, our sales growth rate in the second quarter slowed from what we delivered earlier in the year and was below the outlook that we shared with you on the April call. If you look at the quarter, our constant-currency sales grew about 2% and our adjusted earnings per share were down 8% from the prior year's second quarter results. Needless to say, these results are well below our prior expectations.", "I want to start off by discussing our instrument system results and specifically the weaker-than-anticipated finish that we saw for this segment of our business. Looking back at the first quarter, our instrumentation business grew organically at about 8%, and the similarly healthy growth trend was maintained through most of the second quarter.", "However, in the closing 2 weeks of the quarter, orders booking rates surprisingly and atypically slowed, as customers, primarily in the U.S., delayed issuing orders to us for capital goods. In addition, overseas orders received late in June could not be converted into revenue prior to the end of the quarter.", "As we had in the first quarter, we again increased our backlog in this quarter, but even more significantly. In fact, through the first 6 months of this year we have built about $20 million in backlog, and that's about double the volume we had anticipated. Following the close of the second quarter, we performed a thorough analysis of orders and backlog and confirmed our ability to convert these orders to sales in the second half of 2013. In the full year sales growth outlook that we will supply to you later in this call, please note that we will remain cautious on instrument order growth rates in the second half in response to less predictable purchasing patterns in the first half of 2013, but we will include sales revenue associated with the planned reduction in backlog levels.", "Turning now to an analysis of our second quarter sales. Constant-currency sales growth for the Waters Division was 3%, as flat growth in the combined government and academic end market offset mid-single digit pharmaceutical sales growth. Our chemical analysis sales growth rate was in the low-single digits. Comparing these results to assumptions embedded in our guidance, slower-than-expected growth in pharmaceutical instrument system demand substantially contributed to our revenue shortfall.", "Geographically and for the Waters Division, sales growth in the U.S. was most affected by this late quarter slowdown and consequently finished the quarter marginally down. U.S. pharmaceutical sales in the quarter were flat, with robust recurring revenue growth offset by a decline in instrument system sales. U.S. government and academic sales growth was under pressure, while sales for chemical analysis applications were up at a high-single digit rate.", "In general, our developing markets in Latin America continued to perform well in the second quarter in comparison to mixed results that we saw throughout 2012. Sales growth in Europe was relatively strong and slightly ahead of our expectations. Most notably, government and academic spending for mass spectrometry-based instruments was up at a double-digit rate, while pharma and industrial revenue growth was largely in line with our expectations and up at a mid-single digit rate.", "Waters Division constant-currency sales in Japan were down slightly in the quarter, with a strong uptick in academic spending largely offsetting declines in pharmaceutical and chemical end markets. The strength in academic and government business that we began to see late in the quarter is related to supplemental governmental stimulus programs, and we are encouraged by the prospect that these programs will continue and contribute to growth in our Japanese business in the second half of 2013.", "Asian sales outside of Japan benefited from a strong performance by our Chinese business, where we enjoyed double-digit sales growth, with strong performance by all customer key segments, including pharmaceutical firms.", "Indian sales were flat in the quarter as fluctuations in local currency valuation adversely impacted demand from generic drug makers. Our sales in Asian markets outside of Japan, China and India were generally weaker in the quarter than we had planned as demand from these countries is generally more erratic and associated with the shallow global recovery.", "For our TA Instruments division, constant-currency sales were down by about 3% in the second quarter and were heavily impacted by a backlog build in the quarter. Instrument demand for high temperature and industrial chemical applications were strong, while biocalorimetry platforms were adversely impacted by reduced governmental and academic spending levels. The backlog generated in the second quarter principally involved orders for high-temperature instrumentation and thermal systems for customers in developing Asian markets. Our second half sales growth outlook for TA is more in line with the ordering trends that we saw in the first half of 2013, and specifically, we are targeting low- to mid-single digit constant-currency revenue growth for the division.", "Now I'll discuss some product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters Division in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew nicely in the second quarter, delivering 8% sales growth before currency effects. This growth rate was consistent across the quarter and suggests healthy instrument utilization rates. ACQUITY columns continue to account for an increasing proportion of our overall column business, and we continue to introduce more ACQUITY column chemistries in the quarter.", "Looking at our Waters Division MS instrument system sales, we saw mid-single digit sales growth for UPLC mass spec systems and low double-digit orders growth. Business momentum was strongest through the quarter for high-performance QTof technology systems, including Xevo and SYNAPT platform instruments. Our tandem quadrupole-based instruments delivered strong growth in the quarter and an overall double-digit revenue growth through the first half of 2013.", "At this year's ASMS Conference, we showcased the new SYNAPT platform instrument called the SYNAPT G2-Si. This innovative instrument offers significant advantages to researchers, taking to more fully utilize ion mobility measurements across workflows. In applications ranging from lipidomics to food safety analyses, Waters' scientists and our collaborators demonstrated the unique capabilities of high-performance Ion Mobility Separation for challenging qualitative and quantitative measurements.", "On the chromatography instrumentation front, we had a weaker-than-anticipated quarter, with overall declines for both orders and sales in the mid-single digits. This weakness was most pronounced for our pharmaceutical companies in well-established markets, U.S., western Europe and Japan, and in application areas outside of pharmaceutical QC. ACQUITY H-Class demand continued to ramp for QC applications, but weakened in early-phase development applications, interestingly, the same type of labs where we saw robust demand for advanced mass spec instruments.", "ACQUITY overall and ACQUITY H-Class had particularly strong sales growth in the prior year quarter. The comparisons become easier in the second half of 2013, and as we move into the second half of 2013, we expect to see a return to modest growth for our LC system platforms, with incremental demand for our new ACQUITY advanced polymer characterization system, along with continued ramp of our ACQUITY UPC2 instruments.", "So in summarizing our second quarter results, I believe that the underlying demand for our products and services is stronger and more stable than our second quarter sales growth suggests. Late quarter shifts in the product mix and in geographical mix of orders, in combination with the choppy capital spending environment, all converge to disrupt what had appeared through most of the quarter to be a healthy demand trend. Looking toward the future, I am pleased with new system offerings that are on the near horizon.", "During the past few years, our R&D efforts have delivered significant new innovative system offerings to the markets that we serve, and there's been a nice correlation between new product launches and higher-than-market sales growth. We have seen this with ACQUITY and are now witnessing the positive effects of the recent mass spec system introductions. To that end, we hope to benefit from new system introductions later in the second half of this year, with the sales impact from these launches contributing more meaningfully to 2014 growth.", "Before turning it over to John, I will say a few words about our nonoperational plans. On the M&A front, we will continue to seek smaller complementary technology opportunities that fit our profitability and growth characteristics. Our strategy is to remain a technologically focused company with market-leading offerings for targeted customer sets. We see this as the most viable path of securing long-term growth and leading profitability in the analytical tools business.", "We will remain focused on strong free cash generation because we feel that cash generation is the long-term primary goal for any successful enterprise and a key indicator of our current market strength. In terms of cash deployment and after any bolt-on type business acquisitions, we plan to continue our share repurchase program, a plan which has, over the years, removed more than 1/3 of shares outstanding and meaningfully contributed to predictable EPS growth.", "On closing, when I last spoke to you in April, I mentioned that I felt 2013 would be a successful year for Waters. Though the results of the second quarter remind us that the road to success is not always a straight and smooth path, we do remain confident in our product and market positions and anticipate more profitable growth in the second half of the year.", "Now here's John for a review of our financials and an update on the financial outlook.", "John A. Ornell", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Second quarter sales grew by 2% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 2%, resulting in flat overall sales. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were down 8% to $1.08 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.17 last year.", "On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.03 this quarter versus $1.09 last year, and reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.", "As I just mentioned, before currency translation, sales were up 2%. And looking at this growth geographically, and again before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were down 2%, Europe sales were up 7%, Japan was down 6% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 3% as strong growth in China was offset by weaker sales growth in India and other smaller markets. ROW sales growth in the quarter was strong.", "On the product front and in constant currency, within the Waters Division, instrument system sales decreased by 2% and recurring revenues grew by 8% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, total sales decreased by 3% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q2 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Like last quarter, gross margins continue to be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation and capitalized software amortization. Additionally this quarter, we saw a more pronounced mix shift away from our higher-margin LC instruments in favor of mass spec sales.", "SG&A expenses were flat to last year as a result of continued tight spending controls and foreign currency translation. R&D expenses increased by 3% this quarter. On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for Q2 was about 15%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6.4 million and share count came in at 86.6 million shares, 2.8 million shares lower than Q2 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase program.", "On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $1,650,000,000 and debt totaled $1,268,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of about $382 million. In the quarter, the company successfully refinanced its syndicated bank credit facility, increasing the size by $200 million to $1.4 billion and extending the maturity date to June of 2018. As for Q2 share repurchases, we bought 725,000 shares of our common stock at $70 million. This leaves $478 million remaining on the authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. For Q2, free cash flow came in at $95 million, after funding $80 million of CapEx. Excluded from this CapEx amount is $13 million of spend associated with our new Manchester, U.K. mass spectrometry facility. We expect this facility to be ready for occupancy in 2014. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 74 days this quarter, up 2 days from Q2 last year. And in the quarter, as is typical early in the year, inventories increased by $7 million.", "Now looking at the remainder of 2013. While Q2 sales were below expectations, a continuation of the rate of order production from the first half, coupled with the backlog reduction, supports a mid-single digit growth in sales for the second half of the year. We believe our recurring revenues will provide a foundation of stable mid- to high-single digit growth in the second half of the year and our instrument business will see low-single digit growth as CapEx budgets remain under -- remain more constrained and less predictably released in the markets that we serve. Foreign currency translation at today's rates is expected to continue to depress sales by 2% in the second half of the year.", "Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the full year are expected to be about 59.25%, a modest decline due largely to currency translation, software amortization and the instrument mix shift dynamics I discussed earlier. Gross margins in Q3 are expected to be about 58.5%.", "Operating expenses are expected to be up about 2% to 3% in the second half of the year, bringing full year growth to about 2%. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, and we expect our full year operating tax rate to be between 14.5% and 15%. Our full year average diluted share count is likely to be around 86.5 million shares outstanding.", "Rolling all of this together, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in a range of $5 to $5.10. Earnings per share growth continues to be heavily affected by foreign currency translation this year. Versus prior year, foreign currency translation at today's rates is expected to reduce our full year EPS by about $0.30, almost entirely due to the weaker Japanese yen. While we have kept spending controls in place and will for the entire year, it has not been possible to counteract this currency translation effect meaningfully in the short term.", "As we think about our expectations for the third quarter of 2013, we expect mid-single digit organic sales growth, supported by orders growth that's consistent with our first half rate in combination with a backlog reduction. Currency translation at today's rates would reduce sales by 2%, resulting in reported sales growth of around 3%. This brings our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25.", "Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Operator, I think we can now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from Ross Muken of ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So I guess as we think about sort of the progression of the quarter and kind of the outcome, particularly on the capital equipment side, it's interesting that a notable amount of the weakness came from pharma and on the LC side in the U S. It seems like, in general, that's actually been a piece where a lot of folks are talking about kind of a net strengthening or improvement in demand, at least relative to Europe or maybe some of the emerging markets. And so as you sort of went back post -- looking at the outcome for the Q and looked at what you saw in the backlog, I mean, what do you think was kind of the confluence of events that led to that level of disconnect in those pieces of the business versus some of the other areas where you actually came through quite well, where we've seen actually a little bit less stability from other players or from other macro data?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, there's a lot tied up in that comment, Ross. I think, just from a big picture, clearly, the area that surprised us was the weakness in our LC business, particularly in pharmaceutical areas outside of QC, which is, of course, one of the biggest areas that we service. So it was more in the front end of the research area and in discovery, and frankly, that was an area that was quite strong in our mass spec business. So it's a little bit head scratching because it doesn't appear related to large capital outlays, where we were pretty successful. We have seen periods when we -- the confluence of events throws a quarter at us, where we have an unexpected drop or increase. We saw a very strong instrument business in the first quarter of this year, and while we weren't straight-lining that, we did anticipate that it would be stronger. And in fact, through most of this quarter, we had pretty robust results, and then at the very end of the quarter, it faded, much to our surprise. So I'm not -- as you can tell from our forecast, we don't anticipate that this is a forever dynamic. We are conservatizing our outlook in the second half to some extent. But we don't think that there are major share dynamics going on here, and we don't think this is forever. But we continue to dig deeper in this whole underlying demand phase of the LC instruments.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And maybe as a follow-up, I mean, one of the things you've been dealing with, a lot of folks have been dealing with, their exporters, is kind of the strong dollar. It seems like that could be in play for some time and maybe even continue to move against you. I guess, in that context, for places like India, where we've seen disruptions, the rupee has gone up to kind of INR 60 or something like that or in other kind of emerging geographies, how are you thinking about that as it kind of progresses through the year, where people are kind of adjusting to kind of this new set level and so they're just assuming we're not going to see a correction like in times past, where they've maybe basically delayed spending for more favorable exchange rates instead of just going forward with it? How do you -- what are you sort of assuming for that dynamic in the back half?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, we're assuming that in Japan, we're going to continue to see a yen that's around about the current level, and I think that's a pretty fair estimate. But early -- the yen did weaken from the beginning of the year to this point, so we have seen incremental pain from the translation of the yen. We haven't seen a lot of underlying demand dynamics in Japan as a result of that. So contrary to what happens in India, where, clearly, the very weak rupee has affected the local conditions significantly. We haven't seen that in Japan, and Japan is largely a translation effect on our business. And I think the thing to remember is that while this costs us $0.30 relative to last year's earnings, if the yen stabilizes where it is now, then next year is a more normal period and we don't have that piece of page. So look, we operate in a world of many different currencies, the euro and the yen being the most significant. And we continue to believe that facing the dynamics through our operating plans, it's a slippery slope if you try to hedge these dynamics and then get into dramatic costs and forecasting issues, as you try to forecast well into the future. So historically, we feel like we have done a better job by addressing this through our operations. We'll continue to do that, and we'll have to work our way through it", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Dan Leonard of Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "First off, on your backlog communication, is it right to think that your current level of backlog is about twice what you would normally carry? Or is it some different multiple of that?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, the increment year-to-date, Doug talked about a $20 million increment in the backlog through June, that's up about double what it traditionally would be. And that demand is heavily affecting growth in Asia, specifically, Asia and Japan, through the half. Much of this came in later in week 13 and just given logistics and revenue recognition in that part of the world, couldn't be converted. But that's the increment to the base backlog that we typically have that we're discussing.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "So is it right, then, to think of your second half communication as you can get about a point from additional backlog burn and maybe 4 points from underlying demand on the top line?", "John A. Ornell", "That's exactly right. So the logic to the sales revenue growth in the second half of the year is a continuation of the order rate that would be closer to 4-ish percent. It's the base order rate, coupled with a reduction of backlog over both Q3 and Q4, that would add a point to that. So we're basically projecting that we'll see a continuation of the first half's order rate and then a backlog pull-down to add a point to that in each of the next couple of quarters.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And then my follow-up question, on Japan, assuming a stable yen from here forward, does the absence of that $0.30 headwind in 2013, does that fall to the bottom line in 2014? Or are there offsets?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, when you say does it fall to the bottom line, it just means that you're -- you have a stable base of comparison, Dan. It doesn't...", "John A. Ornell", ".", "It doesn't repeat itself is another way to think of it.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. So if the yen had been stable -- one way of looking at it is if the yen has been, on average, comparable to 2012 this year, our earnings would have been $0.30 higher. So if the yen stays stable, then we think with our -- all other things being equal, if we get where we call our normal growth and our normal attention to the bottom line, you'd see normal earnings growth dynamics from us in the future.", "John A. Ornell", "Exactly. So if the yen doesn't -- this year went from about JPY 80 to JPY 100. If it doesn't go from JPY 100 to JPY 120 next year, we don't repeat that $0.30 penalty.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "You guys indicated LC weakness, I believe, was primarily in U.S. biopharma or developed economy biopharma for non-QA/QC purposes. Just wondering if you could talk about how exactly you know these instruments are being used. I guess what I'm getting at is how confident are you that QA/QC demand remains strong? And if the answer is because you see that -- if part of the answer is because you know what's going on also in mass spec and you know that mass spec is strong in these non-QA/QC areas, like discovery, are you sure that LCs from other vendors aren't being attached to these mass specs? I think this gets it really also a question of how you're positioned share-wise in LC.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, Doug. I think we're pretty confident that our information systems and our reporting mechanisms tell us with pretty good accuracy what's happening in our order rate, where it's coming from. And it also tells us, with a fair degree of precision, whether what we're seeing is due to delayed orders or share loss. And as you know, share just doesn't change radically quarter-to-quarter, and we had very good results in the first quarter. Instrument demand was up 8%, I think, in the first quarter. I wouldn't say wow. Therefore, we took lots of market shares in the first quarter, and demand was down in the second quarter. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time in my career that we're seeing those kinds of swings, so unusual but it happened before. So there's nothing -- there's been no technological advancement, there's been no regulatory issue that's dramatically changed the playing field that we've seen. Yes, we saw one of our vendors incorporate their own LC a year or so ago, and we absolutely saw some dynamic there. That's played itself out. We don't see major shifts in who's putting LCs in front of their mass specs. So I just -- I think that this is more of a timing issue. And additional to the U.S. dynamic, we're clearly seeing a major center of LC demand in India become very challenged by the issue on the ground in India. So I think those 2 issues are clearly what's happening in our instrument demand. India, I think, is likely to continue this year, whereas the other dynamic, I think, is likely to be more of a short-term issue.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So let me ask, I guess, 1, maybe 2 follow-ups. On the timing issue, talking about this as though it's a timing issue. I mean, a lot of your business was strong here. It's clearly how instruments came in at the end of the quarter. I think from talking to you guys over the years, it's probably fair to assume that you get something like ballpark of $80 million in instrument revenue in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And given your miss was attributed primarily to instruments, it seems like that came in closer to something like $60 million to $65 million -- or $15 million to $20 million below target. You talked a lot about how great backlog is heading into Q2. Would you be willing to tell us how much of the Q2 miss you've recaptured in the early weeks of Q3? I think that is important for investors in assessing how much of this truly was a timing issue.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure, Doug. I think your -- our orders are more weighted to the last 2 weeks of the quarter than you estimate. So I think it should be very clear that while we saw very strong comparisons right through the quarter, right into the last part of the quarter, we weren't anticipating that to continue with the rate that it was. So we had, what we thought, some cushion and it still fell off to a degree that brought us to where we are now. As it relates to going forward, there's no question that we've captured some of those orders that we anticipated to get in the second quarter, as we've gone through the third quarter. I caution you, though, that the same thing happened a bit in the first quarter, where we -- there was many millions of dollars awarded that we thought we were going to get late in the first quarter that we absolutely captured in the first part of the second quarter. So that makes me more reluctant to automatically say I know what's happening here. We're satisfied that our stocks in the third quarter has been positive. And I think we've rolled in what we've learned from the second quarter, applied the management judgment that says, \"We don't want a repeat of what we saw in the second quarter.\" So I think the combination of all those factors suggests that we see nothing now that would lead us to believe we could have a repeat of the second quarter. But it's still a forecast, and we're still going to do our best to make sure we achieve it.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And last quick one. In Q1, I think your chemistry growth was just under 1%. We don't know what the number was for Q2, but it's probably at least 7% to 8%. Is the right way to think about this from here is just really think about the first half growth and project it forward? Or are you -- it does sound like you might think it may be a little bit better than that.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think the second quarter is more reflective of what we believe the underlying growth. The first quarter was very unusual and impacted by some things like large chemistry orders that were in the base in Asia that didn't repeat in the second quarter. I think the mid to somewhat higher growth rate for chemistry is much more our feeling going forward.", "Operator", "Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "If we look back, we have seen misses on the business before that were driven by late quarter spending dynamics. I think we all know that. However, if you do look back, you guys have missed -- revenue were put in line -- put up in line reports for something like 6 quarters in a row now. So I appreciate that the operating environment is challenging, but can you give us a little confidence as to why you have good visibility or line of sight on the back half assumptions you're making here and the fact that your guidance is conservative?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, Doug -- Isaac, excuse me, I think that our visibility hasn't changed very much. As you know, we, like most everybody in this business, don't operate with very significant backlogs. So most quarters, we have to generate, in that quarter, the business that we're going to ship and record as revenue. So we have all the tools that we've always had, which is discussions with our customers, historical run rates, projection of the strength of the economic environment, and we have a reasonably sophisticated process. But as we've seen, it's forecasts, and there are a lot of pieces of that, that move around in an individual quarter. We clearly thought and thought through most of this quarter that we had properly anticipated what was going to happen, and then, in very short order, it fell out of bed. We've looked at that, we've examined the underlying trends. Much like the first quarter, we saw this weakness in chemistry, and we didn't believe it. And in fact, that all turned around in the second quarter, and we're reasonably confident that, that's going to continue in the second half. We had a very strong first quarter in instruments, and then it dropped in the second quarter. We don't think that, that was anything we did. We don't think that, as I said, dramatic market share changes occurred. It's frustrating, I know it is for you, and it certainly is for us. But we continue to try to refine what we know, and we overlay what our product introductions are and what the customers are telling us, what the field is telling us. We try to apply a little degree of conservatism there. And -- but I can't tell you that our process has changed as a result of this. We just looked harder, looked harder at the backlog, looked harder at the customer forecast, and we continue to try to do our best. But we live in a world of uncertainty.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. No, I totally understand that part, for sure. One follow-up would be a little bit more on the items that you guys can control, one specifically on just use of cash. I mean, in the past, you've had years where you have purchased stock in excess of the free cash flow you generated. Just given the long-term growth drivers of the business and where you are right now, why not buy back more stock? And then just secondly, if you could touch a little bit on the plan here for mass spec. What do you guys have in the pipeline that you can talk to in terms of new project -- products? And maybe are those defensive products that are going to help the gross margin or the operating margin story?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, on the mass spec front, I think, as I alluded to, we have some, I think, exciting near-term plans that, unfortunately, I don't think I could talk to much more about. But you'll see that happening in the second half, really in the fourth quarter. That should have a significant impact next year, maybe a marginal impact in the fourth quarter. But I think the run rate in mass spec, the competitive positions, that's all encouraging. I think we're -- coming out of the last couple of years, we had to scramble a little bit more to secure our position in mass spec. Current indications are that, that's going well. The second part of that?", "John A. Ornell", "Share repurchases.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes. We continue to believe that our stock's a good investment. John has shared what the authorization is. I can tell you that, at the board level, we continue to wonder whether we're aggressive enough. So that clearly is the way we lean, and I think that's the way we'll continue to lean about applying more of our cash flow to share buyback rather than less. I guess that's probably the most I want to say about that.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Amit Bhalla of Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Doug, TA Instruments has been a consistent positive performer for quite some time. I'm wondering if you could just talk about what the weakness there tells you about the industrial and chemical end markets.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, Amit, it's very unusual -- you're absolutely right. TA has been a consistent performer through many years, and again, I think we've had somewhat of a perfect storm here that is not likely to continue. TA had a combination of slow results in the biocalorimetry piece of their business. It's the first time, I think, in many quarters that we've seen that. And as they have gone back and looked at that, we see no reason to believe that, that's a continuing dynamic. They also had a backlog build that affected their results, and that's been reflected in improvements that we see in the second half. I think they have a very strong market position, a very strong technological base. And I think you'll see TA return to more traditional growth rates as we get through the second half of this year.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "You don't think that there's an underlying end market issue here taking place?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Not versus our level of expectations. I mean, I think we're expecting mid-single digit kind of performance. That's somewhat lower than we've seen traditionally, and yes, I do think that, that's kind of market related. But off that base, I don't expect dramatic changes.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And Doug, just a follow-up on the academic, government comments you made, can you talk to -- talk about those in the context of any incremental changes sequentially or just put into better context what's going on in that end market?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think the European markets were pretty strong in that segment of our business. And we also saw an uptick, although it wasn't all shippable in the Japanese marketplace as they kicked in with some stimulus spending. The place where we saw disappointing results and clearly, some impact from the sequester was in the U.S. And so some of that business, we expect to actually return in the second half, but we haven't been overly ebullient in what we're expecting out of government sources in the U.S. in the second half. I think it's going to continue to be a tough area until the whole government spending in the U.S. gets somewhat more straightened out.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to ask first a question on India. Certainly, I know into the quarter, there's optimism that you guys were to recovery. Just wanted to kind of flesh out a little bit the results that you saw, kind of the rupee versus some of the other operational issues that you've been seeing in India and kind of what's implied in your guidance for the back half of the year there.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, India has been frustrating because now it's almost about a year of continuing weakness in the rupee that continues to put pressure on almost all of these accounts of getting the capital to invest. And boy, if you looked at the discussions that we're having with those accounts and how much they want to buy, you'd say it's going to be strong double-digit growth as far as the eye can see. So the customer expectations and desires are certainly there, but they've been unable to fulfill that and get the capital to invest. Now in the second quarter, that's coupled with the fact that we had a reasonably strong second quarter in India last year and so that makes the comparison tougher. We have easier comparisons as we go through the second half, but that's kind of not a statement on the return to growth of the India market. We were anticipating it'll continue to be tough in the second half, and I see no signs that they've really had a fundamental ability to overcome the fact that the rupee has weakened by some 20-plus percent in the last year or so. So I think it's going to continue to be a struggle.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Maybe just shifting gears over to the kind of chromatography weakness in the quarter. Can you -- Doug, I think you were citing sometimes things are somewhat unexplainable with this weakness that you saw in discovery chromatography. But is there another quarter, possibly, you could point to in the past when you saw that type of weakness in chromatography and discovery work? Anything to get our -- help get our arms around this event and how we should evaluate this quarter's weakness and an expected pickup as we move forward.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, we have seen -- but it's not -- some of it is formfitting. You go through a quarter like this where you have weak demand in discovery, and you'd say what are the dynamics that we think affected it. In the past, we've seen mergers in big pharma that can dramatically affect the demand swings from a quarter to a quarter. So we've seen that, over the past 10 years, 2 or 3x, where demand sucked as they were absorbing mergers and acquisitions. I'd say, we -- it's unusual to see it in a period like this, where there's relative stability in the big pharma marketplace. So I can't point to a specific point in the past, where things have done like this. And it's a little surprising to see the strength in mass spec and to see weakness in the chromatography. But as I say, it's telling that we saw strength in the chromatography market, greater strength in the first quarter, and so you look at the average across that, you're looking at low-single digit first half growth. That's probably more telling and more indicative of what the market is doing than any one quarter standing on its own. So that's what we think, and that's what we're planning for.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And then maybe I can sneak just one more in. Just back to an earlier question, Doug, it's just kind of on your attach rate. Could you discuss kind of how it's been trending, say, over the past kind of a year plus or so and kind of what you expect going forward? I think you commented that there's no issue with the attach rate. Just wondering if you could put a little bit more detail.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, I would say -- I wouldn't say the attach rate in terms of our consumables business is getting higher. I'd say it continues to be very good. And ACQUITY is a big piece of that, where the use of our consumables with our ACQUITY instruments from the day of introduction was high and continues to be very high. I would say we see no falloff, but then we don't see a greater attach rate. But it's high and we continue to be satisfied with it.", "Operator", "Jon Groberg of Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Doug, just I think you mentioned this before. But in the first quarter, you also mentioned pharma kind of delays. And as you alluded to on this call, that's why you're not getting too far ahead of yourselves because you saw it again on the second quarter. So I'm just curious, is this just 1 or 2 customers that this happens to each quarter. Has it been broad-based, these delays? Do you think this is just kind of the new norm?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, it's certainly not universal, Jon. It's -- we see strength in some large pharma accounts and weakness in others. And some of it's quarter-to-quarter, where one that was weak in the first quarter is strong in the second quarter. Some of that's project related. We continue to believe that, long term, this is a good set of customers, that the demands on them and the demands in early stage continue to be high. And we continue to believe that we're introducing capabilities across our platforms in chemistry and in instruments and in data and information processing that will produce gains for us. It's certainly been frustrating that, that's been as choppy as it has been. And you see individual cases where you can understand that somebody -- some pharmaceutical in China gets challenged because of regulatory issues and you see orders flow there, but those are one-offs. There's not one layer of dynamic that's affecting everybody in this industry.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So is it kind of fair to say, last quarter, it was a certain set of customers; this quarter, it's a different set of customers? And I'm just curious, for the second half outlook that you described, would you say that now you're kind of taking into account that, that's likely to happen at the end of each of the next couple of quarters as well.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, we think so. We -- as I say, we don't think that the first quarter instrument growth rate in the high-single digits was run-ratable. We don't think that the rate in the second quarter. We think the average of that is more likely what we're going to see in the second half, and that's what we've planned for.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "And just to hop on instruments, I think, it has MS. It actually sounded like demand for instruments was pretty stable, kind of what you're describing now. So for like the first half of the year, if you exclude revenue, but if you just talked about orders, can you maybe talk about mass spec versus LC for the first half of the year in terms of orders, kind of what that looks like?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I mean, as we said, the instrument order rate is mid-single digits.", "John A. Ornell", "Mass spec, a little faster.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "And mass spec is a little higher, and LC is a little lower.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then, if I can, to just finish my question, but then just -- John, can you maybe, just really quickly -- it sounds like, for the year, you're still talking about mid-single digit growth, which is, what, last quarter, what you guys talked about for the full year. I kind of go down through the P&L of some of the ships that you made. Can you maybe just highlight what are the key reasons for the lowered kind of EPS guidance, given the -- it looks like a similar mid-single digit top line?", "John A. Ornell", "For the second half, I think, basically, what we're saying, the guidance on the EPS is down largely as a result of the miss in the second quarter. And then, on the second half of the year, there's just a modest decline in earnings associated with a slightly worse yen than what we had before. Share count is up a little bit versus where we thought we might be as a result of the higher share price, and there's other little bits of movement between expenses and a slightly lower tax rate. But it's all kind of rounding, if you will, Jon. So it's -- the dropoff in EPS of $0.15 versus the midpoint guide to guide is largely a Q2 miss with the second half largely intact.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Amanda Murphy of William Blair.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I actually had a follow-up to Doug's earlier question on the chromatography sales. So obviously, the sales are a bit weaker on the pharma side but -- or early stage side. I'm curious, can you help us think about -- or even qualitatively, think about the contribution from sales to the regulated markets? Just assuming that's a contributor to growth in some ways, I'm just trying to figure out how much that is and how to think about that over the rest of the year.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Amanda, when you talk about the regulated markets, are you talking about just pharma in general, pharma QC or...", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I guess I was thinking about pharma QA/QC, but maybe you can talk to it more broadly as well.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, pharma QA/QC was right on our expectations. So as I said, it was really the R&D and tending towards the discovery segment of pharma that was off our expectations. The regulated market, I think, continues to be pretty predictable. That's where the workhorse instruments go. It's where productivity -- it's much like a manufacturing process of writing those analyses. So I would say the demand there tends to be more predictable, more consistent. And historically, I think the other stages of pharmaceutical capital spending tends to be lumpier and less predictable.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "So in terms of QA/QC adoption of the H-Class, for example, I mean, is that something that could accelerate or be a larger contribution -- or contributor on the back half? Or do you expect that to be sort of...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think, over time, we believe that H-Class will continue to penetrate more and more QC. Our penetration has been good, but it certainly is not universal. But I wouldn't suggest that you see significant dynamics in a quarter-to-quarter basis. This is a multiyear dynamic that I suggest you see not quarter-to-quarter.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then just a similar question on the mass spec side and maybe this is a moot question just given your comments on some of the potential launches you might have coming up here. But -- so you've obviously had some pretty good results there in the higher end side of it with SYNAPT and Xevo. I mean, how do you think about that in terms of how much more runway you have given some of the improvements in the product line that you've introduced recently? Is that something that can -- that growth rate can sustain for multi-quarters? Or is that something that you should see this year and then maybe tapers off next year?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'm pretty encouraged by the opportunities in the high end. And I think our introductions and our current interactions with customers in metabonomics and proteomics are -- I think are served markets that are showing very good results. The opportunities in the applied markets, particularly in food safety, continue to grow and provide, I think, a very secure long-term source of mass spec revenues. An encouraging current dynamic is in the clinical market. We've served the clinical market in places like the neonatal and any rejection growth analyses market and pain monitoring areas. Those are well-developed segments of the clinical marketplace. Some of you may have seen recent results, particularly coming out of Britain, on emerging areas that we're participating heavily in and have very good visibility. I think that's longer term. That's not going to affect the second half of this year. But there were very good signs of emerging applications for mass spec and high value-added mass spec that we're developing in the clinical marketplace. So I think that's very encouraging. And I think we're working on some of the areas of bringing mass spec to the underserved areas on the benchtop. So that we hope to have some more information on as we go through 2013.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then just last quick one on Japan. Have you looked at the stimulus dollars and sort of figured out how much of that might be available to Waters specifically?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, we looked at the particular tenders that have been let under that. Of course, not all tenders have been let under the expectation. And the stimulus approvals in Japan came later than originally anticipated. So we absolutely have booked several orders late in the quarter under the stimulus plan. And we're anticipating that the net result of that, with our ongoing business in Japan, we'll see an improvement in our growth rate in the second half of this year.", "Operator", "Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Doug, how confident are you in being able to get back to a long-term top line organic growth rate of something like the 7% that you guys usually want to see?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "It's still our target. We still believe that the markets we serve and that the technologies that we bring, combined with the geographical dynamics and the improvements in the developing markets -- I do understand that any time you have a period when it's been a challenge to meet those rates, raises questions about whether you have to reconsider what those long-term growth rates are. But I think we've been in a relatively unusual period, lots of challenges. Typically, coming out of these periods is where you see some of your best growth, and I still believe that we're capable of producing those growth rates. We're not so large to be challenged inordinately by kind of the lot of large numbers. And so yes, I still believe that the combination of our technologies can get us to that mid- to high-single digit growth rate.", "Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I mean, I guess, when you think about the end markets, when you guys have kind of achieved those levels of growth in the past you've had government, academic funding that was growing pretty rapidly every year and you had pharmaceutical R&D spending that was growing pretty rapidly every year. And those 2 dynamics, for sure, have seemingly changed for the -- at least the intermediate term.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, certainly, big pharma has changed. But we're coming into -- coming off a period where startup biotech funding has been pretty robust, and we're coming off a period where biotech spending was pretty slow. So we see near-term opportunities in some of that smaller to intermediate-sized biotech spending to be very encouraging. So look, I think it's fair questions, but in my experience, it's -- people tend to look at -- if they're at the bottom of the well, they tend to forecast that they're always going to be there. And when times are rosy and robust, the tendency is to forecast that those conditions will continue. Generally, it's just the opposite. Generally, what happens is that when industry conditions are weak, they tend to get better. Obviously, that's in my best interest, but I think that traditionally has been what's happened. I think it would be wrong to think that, all of a sudden, the technologies that we provide are becoming less valued in the world.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So in the interest of time, I'll keep it short. So did -- in the pharma discovery, when you're talking about LC delays, was this delays of new LC systems for purchases or were these replacements? Do you have any clarity on that? And I guess Europe was strong in the quarter. Could you compare and contrast the European pharma versus the U.S. pharma? I think people are trying to figure out the dynamics that was going on in discovery areas there, if there's anything that's markedly going on that is different.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Derik, there's no difference between European pharma and U.S. pharma. I mean, in terms of the -- these are multinational companies. And really, it would be wrong to think that Glaxo and AstraZeneca are riding high and Pfizer and Lilly are riding low. That could be happening, but they're related to individual corporate dynamics, not related to geographical applications. And so while it's true that we score our business in a particular way that says this business was generated in Europe and it came out of a pharma company, but I think it's more to think about the pharma industry in global terms and the fact that global spending in our front end was weak. So I think it's that piece that suggests that in the tradeoff of separations versus detection in the mass spec, the air is on the side of the higher end mass spectrometry purchases this quarter. But I think, as I've said and I continue to say, there's a leveling off. Those tend to be 1 quarter dynamics that don't indicate a permanent change.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. One quick follow-up. You mentioned environmental last quarter being a little bit soft. Did environmental improve this quarter?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Environmental was okay. I'd say in the non-pharma markets, the food safety and food analysis is probably the strongest area of our non-pharma business.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Dan Arias of UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe just one for me. Doug, going back to pharma. When you think about your view there and what you're seeing out of those accounts, does the growth outlook at this point include anything in the way of expectations for a budget flush in 4Q? I guess to the extent that you have a feel, what's the general thinking in terms of end-of-the-year spending there?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I would say we always -- in our run rates, we always see some end-of-the-year uptick or fourth quarter dynamic. It's become, I'd say, less and less. Certainly, in my time in the industry, if you went back 10, 15 years, there was a much bigger end-of-the-year dynamics than there is currently. So we don't expect an inordinate end-of-the-year dynamic in those terms. We expect a more normalized pattern of demand.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Tycho Peterson of JPMC.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Question on the OpEx. If we look at the original guidance you provided for the year, it was 3% to 4% OpEx growth. Obviously, that was off the 5% expectations originally for the year on the top line. Now you're talking about 2%. Can you just talk about -- to the extent that you've got levers to pull here, are these project delays? Is it just less travel? Can you talk about where the OpEx leverage is coming from?", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, it's slightly more effect as a result of currency, but mostly it's associated with holding back on discretionary spend at the levels that we're likely to end at now. There'll be slightly less variable pay schemes being paid out. There'll be -- the project expense associated with getting new products out and making those investments is largely intact. But we are looking to, everywhere we can, hold back on spend to compensate for the yen and the somewhat softer order rate as we make our way through the second half.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "So it largely comes out of everything we've described as discretionary spend, Tycho. I mean, it's travel, it's meetings, it's -- you can't do it forever, but you can continue to limit that. And you put on extra controls, and you make life as miserable as possible to have somebody spend incremental money. And it's a tough time, and I think everybody appreciates that they have got to tighten their belts a little more. We're not embarking on any significant structural reductions. Again, it's important to recognize that $0.30 a share of our pain this year is coming out of the yen. And we do think that, that has a fixed lifetime, that we'll come out of this, and we don't want to do things that causes us long-term pain. But in the short term, if everybody takes their belts down a notch, we can help keep our expenses lower.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then a quick follow-up, can you just comment on general pricing trends in the market today? And then also, can you clarify what your expectations are on academic in the back of the year? I think I heard you say that you thought it could get a little bit better. I just want you to clarify that.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I'll take the general pricing trends, and John can talk about academics. But general -- in any period of time, a quarter or 6 months, we'll see 1 territory in the world kind of pop up with the sales force complaining that so and so has given away their products and it's much tougher to sell because, god, the discounts are ranging high. You almost always get some territory that's complaining about that. If you look at our average end market pricing across instruments, mass spec and chemistry, we have seen no significant change in that. Our margin, to the extent that you can see, a slight change in margin. It comes from mix and the fact that our mass spec margins are a little bit lower than our instrument margins, but it doesn't relate to a change period-to-period in the pricing. Pricing has been solidly constant.", "John A. Ornell", "And on the government, academic expectation, we started the year with a high-single digit growth in government and academic. We came into the second quarter, it flattened out there. So the expectation and the guide in the third and fourth quarter is that we'll see a couple percent growth worldwide for that market.", "Operator", "Our next question does come from Peter Lawson of Mizuho Security.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Just to dig down deeper, on the customers, what were they actually saying around those delayed orders?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'm sorry, Peter, what -- I didn't catch all of that. What are the customers saying about the delayed orders?", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Yes, exactly.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, in terms of some specific orders, we've actually seen them close in the third quarter. So that gives us some confidence that our people on the ground were right, in that a number of those orders were in the works and for either capital spending reasons or just administrative delays, they flipped from the second quarter into the third quarter. When you look at the pharma dynamic in early stage, our customers -- again, you don't get them to talk specifically about a delayed order necessarily there. It's -- they're not saying anything different about their commitment to early-stage discovery. It's not like a big pharmaceutical company is now saying that they're out of the early-stage discovery business. So you probe around it as to what their capital budgets are, what their plans are, and that's the same story. We don't believe that there are significant changes, and that's another reason why we think that this is just kind of quarterly abnormality, that we're more likely to see a more average period of demand than we are -- either the spike in the first quarter or the downward turn in the second quarter.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then the disconnect you're seeing in LC versus mass spec for pharma discovery, could that be anything internal versus being an external issue?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Internal, by -- you mean, like a company specifically?", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Yes, sales organization issue or...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "No, we don't think so. We don't think it's the fact that the sales force is happier with mass spectrometry. We have pretty good mechanisms to -- both in the compensation arena, as well as in the field force management. We don't think this is internally driven. We think that this is just the vagaries of demand across a big wide, worldwide marketplace.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And how much of it -- FX impact, how has that changed since 1Q? I guess I'm trying to work out how much of the...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Kind of little bit worse, probably $0.05 worth in the second half.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, we ended up having the yen, as you might recall, lifting up meaningfully across the quarter, coming kind of back down to where we thought it would be. But the average was like a couple percent higher across the quarter. Other currencies were under a little bit of pressure versus original guy. But really, the yen, at the end of the day, is the biggest contributor, and you're looking at, as Doug said, about $0.05 across the year associated with incremental FX.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And that's versus 1Q and now?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "That's versus -- right, the guide we gave in April for the 1Q results.", "Operator", "Our last question does come from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "My question is just a follow-up on one of your answers to Tycho's question regarding operating expenses. And I was just wondering, now that you've had to lower the EPS guidance again, as it relates to your variable compensation, how much of a reduction in variable comp is there? I think, if I remember correctly, maybe last year, there was a pretty large cost of variable comp last year that helped earnings a little bit. I was just wondering how much variable comp has come now -- come down now in your new guidance.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, that -- there's still some base amount of variable comp that's in there for various geographies and various groups, so they are likely to still achieve some base level of hedge. There's other measures, EPS and others, that are now likely not to have a payout. So a significant portion of the decline is associated with expectations that plans won't be met and we'll see a reduction in the variable pay that leads to a meaningful piece of that reduction overall.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Just to flesh out, the meaningful -- our variable pay plan for the senior people, as I talked about the 25 senior people in the company, are all driven off earnings per share growth, and the payouts don't get meaningful until you get to double-digit earnings per share growth. So in a period like this where there is minimal, if any, earnings per share growth, there is no variable comp that is paid out. So we go into the year, of course, planning to have a successful year, and if it turns out like this year, then there will be no variable payout of any significant amount to the senior-most players in the company.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "I think that goes to the heart of my question. Just were you accruing for senior management incentive compensation and now because of the guidance reduction, you reversed that or you've stopped accruing for that?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "There is a piece of that. We -- coming out of the first quarter, we anticipated that there would be some payout, now we're not.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Is there any way to quantify that change?", "John A. Ornell", "It's a few million dollars.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, it's in the low millions of dollars.", "John A. Ornell", "Right. We were accruing, Steve, at the lowest payout levels in the first place. Otherwise, it would have been a more meaningful amount.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Okay. I appreciate everybody staying on well past our normal stop date -- stop time. Hopefully, that helped you in putting in, in perspective coming off a difficult quarter. I do want to emphasize that we have seen times like this in the past. We're disappointed that we had a soft quarter. We do think that we're well positioned for the future, and we do think that the second half is likely to be a better performance than we saw this quarter. So hopefully, you'll all be back to hear about that the next time we get together, and we hope to hear from you again. Thanks for taking the time, and we'll talk to you again.", "Operator", "Today's conference has ended.

If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter and full year 2013 conference call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, our Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, the Corporate Vice President. Well, today, I will start with an overview of the business. Then John will follow with details of our financial results, and Gene will conclude our prepared remarks with an outlook for our business in 2014. But before we start, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.", "John A. Ornell", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q1 and full year of 2014. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, in Part 1 under the caption Business Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2014.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to meet most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, John. Well, I'm pleased to tell you that our 10% constant currency revenue increased in the fourth quarter with a strong finish to 2013 and resulted in full year sales growth that was in line with the growth that we had anticipated early in 2013. When you look at the full year, stronger academic and industrial spending, significantly in overseas markets, offset less robust sales growth for new instrument systems, primarily to our larger pharmaceutical accounts. These trends were reflected in our product line revenues in 2013 as high-end mass spectrometry sales to academic and biotech accounts were particularly strong, while growth for core chromatography instruments recovered late in the year. Throughout the year, our recurring revenues grew consistently, indicating increasing utilization of instrument systems in the installed base, a positive indicator for future new system sales. Across our markets, pricing held up well in 2013, while gross margins were slightly off from last year's due to a combination of currency effects and product mix dynamics.", "Through the year, we judiciously managed our expenses while adding required field personnel to support customers in rapidly expanding regional markets. In addition, we supported several new product introductions for our Waters and TA divisions. Our slower-than-typical growth in operating income was largely due to the sharp decline in the Japanese yen.", "So for the full year, our adjusted earnings per share were up moderately to $5.04, an increase that's significantly less than typical given our history of generating operating leverage along with accreting EPS through our share repurchase plan. However, the effects of currency translation in 2013 largely explain the slower-than-expected growth in adjusted EPS.", "Looking at the fourth quarter. Constant currency sales in the corporation were up 10% for both instrument system sales and for our recurring revenue. The strength that we saw in the quarter was balanced in terms of major geographical regions and across our product lines. In comparison to our results earlier in the year, the most pronounced improvement was in the sales growth for Waters Division instrument systems, which were up close to 10%. Geographically and for the Waters Division, sales growth in the United States was up 9%. In the quarter, we saw a meaningful improvement in pharmaceutical spending and very strong industrial, chemical and food analysis sales. For the full year, sales in the U.S. were up at a mid-single-digit rate.", "Sales growth in Europe for the Waters Division was up 5%. As we saw earlier in the year, for Europe, academic spending was robust and grew at a strong double-digit rate in the quarter. Year-over-year European pharmaceutical sales were slightly down in the quarter due to a strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "However, looking at this segment from an orders growth perspective and sequentially from the third quarter results, the trends are encouraging and more reflective of the improvement that we saw in the U.S.", "Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan increased in the quarter due to continued government funding -- funded spending, primarily for research-focused applications. The strength in Japan was particularly driven by strong sales of high-end UPLC/MS/MS instruments for academic institutions.", "In the quarter, our business to industrial and pharmaceutical firms continued to be under pressure. We are hopeful that new stimulative policies will revive the export-driven industrial firms in Japan and consequently result in higher levels of scientific instrumentation demand.", "Our quarterly sales growth in China returned to a solid double-digit rate, as administrative delays that we cited in the third quarter were largely resolved and allowed us to return to a quarterly revenue growth more in line with the true business momentum in China. In the quarter, shipments of instrument systems to governmental and academic customers drove our growth with end-use applications for life science research, food testing and environmental monitoring all showing strength.", "Sales in India were down modestly in the quarter compared to the 2012 quarter, but shipment volumes were a little higher than in the third quarter of 2013. All in and in light of improving ordering trends, we continue to feel that demand in India has stabilized and hold out optimism that 2014 will be a better year. For the full year, our business in India did grow modestly in contrast to the contraction in sales that we experienced in 2012. Our sales in Asian markets outside of Japan, China and India grew at a double-digit rate, an improvement over the growth we saw earlier in the year and a promising sign as we enter 2014.", "Our TA Instruments division had a very strong quarter with double-digit sales growth primarily based on strong demand across the entire TA portfolio of products and for most large regions. Core thermal and rheology instruments provided a strong foundation for growth for the year, and in the fourth quarter, TA closed on 2 small acquisitions and is quickly integrating these product technologies into the TA lineup.", "Now I'll discuss some product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters Division in the quarter. The division's recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter. Chromatography consumable sales were strong in the quarter and grew by 10%. A portion of this growth can be attributed to a favorable base of comparison and an extra selling day in the quarter. However, the lion's share of the growth is associated with the continued rapid uptake of ACQUITY columns, including our new line of CORTECS column. Our service business also performed very well in the quarter and grew at a high-single rate with balanced strength across all major regions of the world.", "Looking at our Waters Division mass spec instrument system sales. We continued to see strongest demand in the quarter for high-performance QTof technology systems, including Xevo and SYNAPT platform instruments. New SYNAPT G2-Si, which we introduced at ASMS last June, continues to be well received for large biomolecule applications. At the same time, our UNIFI-enabled Xevo QTof instrument is potentially defining a new market category for bench-top accurate mass and rapid screening mass spec capabilities for both life science and applied market applications.", "Sales of our tandem quadrupole system were flat in comparison to a strong quarter last year. Sequentially, demand was up nicely from shipment levels in the third quarter. And in 2013, we enjoyed our highest volume for tandem quadrupole technology instrument in our history.", "In all, 2013 was a strong year for Waters and mass spectrometry. We believe that we have secured a differentiated position in research Tof technology, by uniquely coupling high-resolution ion mobility capability and advanced software to deliver an easy-to-use and performance-leading SYNAPT system.", "On the chromatography instrumentation front, I believe we delivered an impressive quarter from multiple perspectives. Importantly, we saw a nice recovery in demand from our pharmaceutical customer base and classical small molecule applications to augment an already healthy trend in biomolecule applications. The improved demand was primarily for ACQUITY UPLC systems.", "In addition, our chromatography instrument growth was further enhanced by higher sales volumes of application-tailored systems, including our proprietary UPC2 instrument and our advanced polymer characterization system. Both of these systems are quickly reaching a point where larger accounts will begin to incorporate multiple systems into their research workflows.", "Most significantly, we are excited and pleased with the recent introduction of a new detection technology that's attractive for existing and new customers alike. When we last spoke in October, I noted the introduction of the Waters ACQUITY QDa, a compact, easy-to-use and cost-effective LC detector, incorporating quadrupole mass spectrometry technology and enabling chromatographers to augment their current instruments with molecular mass measurements. The reception of this product among our existing base of users has been very positive, and the QDa was quickly recognized as providing a unique set of attributes. This positive first impression was quickly followed by a high interest to purchase, quickly generated purchase orders and instrument deliveries. Interestingly, we found that about half of early orders for the QDa included the purchase of complete Waters systems rather than a mass detector upgrade to an existing instrument. We are confident that our late year introduction of this technology has provided our customers the opportunity to include this new system in their 2014 capital purchasing plans. Thinking more broadly, this new detector is enabling a first-of-its-kind LC system for both research and routine testing applications, much in the same way compact bench-top GC/MS technology transformed the gas chromatography market.", "So in summarizing our fourth quarter results, overall instrument system demand improved meaningfully from what we experienced through the first 3 quarters. Though weak public sector demand in the United States and restructuring activities at some of our large pharmaceutical accounts continued to serve as headwinds, global strength in public sector segments, along with continued improvements in industrial demand, contributed to a strong quarterly result and allowed our full year sales growth to recover to a solid mid-single digit level. Throughout the year, our recurring revenues delivered predictable and profitable growth. Our TA Instruments business continued to perform well, contributing positively to the top and bottom line of the corporation. Sales growth in this division suggests that TA is doing a good job at attracting an increasing share of the improving advanced materials characterization market.", "We see factors that suggest to us that market conditions in 2014 will be as good or better than those of 2013. U.S. public spending for research is likely to improve with the issuance of an NIH budget. The gradual global economic recovery will hopefully continue, and China will continue to invest in scientific infrastructure.", "In addition, India may return to more reasonable growth, and we are encouraged that our technologically differentiated products, such as the SYNAPT G2-Si and our new ACQUITY QDa, will contribute -- will continue to attract new orders even from a challenging pharmaceutical end market.", "Before turning it over to John and Gene, I will say a few words about our nonoperational plans. In short, please expect more of the same in terms of our capital structure and deployment of our free cash. On the M&A front, we will continue to seek smaller complementary technology opportunities that fit our profitability and growth characteristics. Our strategy remains focused on seeking assets that enhance our technology and market-leading positions within the broadly defined liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis markets. The key deployment for our cash flow has been toward our share repurchase program, and this will likely continue into the future.", "In closing, I believe we have a great business and a proven long-term strategy. A commitment to the continuity of this proven business model has allowed us to both maintain market leadership and strong returns over the last 20 years. As we look toward the future and consider our capital allocation, research priorities and management development plans, we plan to proceed in ways to best ensure that the core tenets of our strategy will be preserved and consequently, our customers, employees and shareholders best served.", "Now here's John for a review of our fourth quarter financials.", "John A. Ornell", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Fourth quarter sales grew by 10% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 2% resulting in 8% overall sales growth. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 7% to $1.70 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.59 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.65 this quarter versus $2 last year. And a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.", "As I just mentioned, before foreign currency translation, sales were up 10%. Looking at this growth geographically and again, before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 10%. Europe was up 5%. Japan was up 3%, and sales in Asia, outside of Japan, were up 15%. On the product front and in constant currency, within the Waters Division, instrument system sales increased by 9%, and recurring revenues grew by 9% as well this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, total sales increased by 16% versus prior year.", "Now I would like to comment on our Q4 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margins came in as expected at 59.5% and continued to be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation versus prior year. SG&A expenses were up 6% this quarter driven largely by sales greater than forecasted, generating higher variable compensation expenses in several geographies. And R&D spending was up by 8% driven by heavier project expenses on new products.", "On the tax front, our higher sales performance was weighted towards our higher tax rate geographies and brought our full year tax rate to about 14.5% versus our previous expectation of about 14%. Within the quarter, the effect of applying this rate to our full year pretax income reduced our earnings per share by about $0.04.", "In the quarter, net interest expense was $6.9 million, and share count came in at 86 million shares, 1.9 million shares lower than Q4 last year, as a result of our continuing share repurchase programs.", "On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $1,804,000,000, and debt totaled $1,323,000,000, bringing to us a net cash position of about $481 million. As for Q4 share repurchases, we bought 755,000 shares of our common stock for $75 million. This leaves $348 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. For Q4, free cash flow came in at $133 million after funding $23 million of CapEx. Excluded from this CapEx amount is $8 million of spend associated with major facility construction.", "Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 69 days this quarter, down 2 days from Q4 last year. And in the quarter, inventories declined by $16 million.", "So for the full year, 2013 sales grew by 5% pre-currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales by 2%. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 2% to $5.04 per share versus $4.93 last year. 2013 saw significant currency headwinds from the Japanese yen. All in, currency translation reduced earnings by $0.27 versus prior year. Without this currency effect, the 5% sales growth would have resulted in approximately 8% growth in non-GAAP earnings before diluted share.", "And now here's Gene with the current financial view of 2014.", "Eugene G. Cassis", "Well, thank you, John, and good morning all. Looking ahead to 2014, our outlook generally assumes the continuation of the market conditions we saw in 2013. Specifically, we are envisioning stable increases in our recurring revenue sales in combination with a modest increase in the growth rate of our instrument shipments. This growth in instrument sales is associated with an assumption of a continued improvement in the overall global economy and from our new product initiatives. We feel these factors combine to support a mid-single-digit organic sales increase for 2014. Currency at today's rates and in light of our sales and cost footprints should be about neutral to our revenue and operating income growth.", "Moving down to P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2013. Volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains may likely be offset by increases in costs associated with the startup our new U.K. mass spectrometry center and potentially with higher initial manufacturing costs for new products planned for introduction in 2014. At the projected sales growth rate, operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate that's slightly less than sales.", "Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense is expected to be around $28 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. This projected change in rate is higher than our 2013 rate and assumes that United States R&D tax credits that reduced our '13 rate by more than 1% will not be extended into 2014.", "We plan to continue our share repurchase program throughout this year at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of about 85 million shares.", "Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2014 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $5.35 to $5.55.", "Now looking at the first quarter of 2014. We are estimating that sales will grow at a slightly slower rate than for the full year. This expectation is due primarily to a strong quarter -- first quarter in 2013 and accordingly a moderately more challenging base of comparison.", "Currency at today's rates is about neutral to sales and the stronger euro being offset by weakness in the Japanese yen.", "An increase in our effective tax rate will adversely impact the first quarter's earnings. Last year, in the first quarter, the rate included a recognition of both a 2012 R&D tax credit, as well as one in 2013. The 2012 credit was only passed by Congress early in 2013.", "So rolling all these factors together, we expect the first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15.", "Thank you. Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Thank you, Gene. And Amy, I think now we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So Doug, I'm just thinking about it a little bit, and I'm sort of bouncing back a little bit between calls, but I know you've highlighted the strength of QDa, and I'm just trying to think as we move into '14 here, new products overall. What else can we expect? And what would you expect their contribution to be to the top line kind of over the next 12 to 24 months?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think, Jon, we've got a number of things that we're aiming for, essentially the Pittsburgh Conference and ASMS, which is middle of the year. But of course, the QDa, we really only saw their results in the fourth quarter, and so you'll wind up seeing 3 quarters of incremental growth from the QDa in 2014, which we expect to continue to provide some momentum there. We're not prepared to discuss the mass spec introductions that are coming at ASMS, but I think you can tell from our history to expect some new innovations showing up at ASMS. We're also seeing continued momentum coming out of our introduction of the UPC2, which had good results in 2013, and we think we have many years of momentum that are likely to come out of the UPC2 product line. And finally, TA, which has substantially refreshed their product lines over the last 1.5 years, as well as incorporating the series of their small acquisitions over the past 12 months, we think we can get incremental growth out of the TA product lines, too. So that's all very encouraging, I think.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And maybe just to follow up, tying it into end markets. Are you seeing any end markets, in particular, more receptive to buying some of these new products as opposed to the ones that are maybe still a little bit more conservative?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think what we saw as we came through the latter part of 2013, I think the key words is broad based. We saw excellent response across most of our major product segments and saw an improvement in the broad-based pharmaceutical market. Now granted it wasn't so much big pharma that, that came from, as much as specialty pharmaceuticals, biotech. But I'd say we're certainly seeing a good response to our technologies across the applied markets, as well as the broad-based life science markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just wondering if you can dig in a little bit more on kind of pharmaceutical trends, Doug, John and Gene. Maybe just give us some color. I know, Doug, in your wrap-up, you mentioned there was just still kind of a headwind, although they did improve this quarter. So kind of what are you seeing from kind of your large pharma in terms of restructuring kind of trends and spending, whether it be geographically or just any anecdotal color to help us?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'd say we're continuing to see slow momentum out of the large integrated pharmaceutical companies. We still see a lot of restructuring going on there. I would say looking for silver linings, the response to the QDa across big pharma in the early stages has been very good. We haven't seen them move en masse to the technology, but I'd say we're very hopeful about the response in big pharma to the QDa and what it can mean across their applications. But clearly, the strength that we've seen in the broad-based pharmaceutical life science market has been really outside of the big pharma accounts, particularly strong in CROs, particularly strong in biotech. So that's what we saw coming out of the latter part of 2013 there.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And then would you characterize your 5% organic as kind of a conservative guide given the improvement in NIH funding, PMIs globally improving and some of the trends that you're seeing with your customers?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I'd say we're trying to be as realistic as possible as we always try to be in looking out 12 months. I think, clearly, we saw a bit of an inflection in the fourth quarter, and that's very encouraging coming late in the year as to what that might portend for 2014. But one swallow doth not a summer make, so we want to put probably a little bit more behind us before we take that kind of growth to the bank. So we're trying to walk that line. We'd clearly like to overdeliver on our forecast. That's been hard in some years past, and maybe we're set up to reverse that trend. But I think we've got to put a little more experience behind us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I'm curious what your thoughts are. I know you made some comments on India, but in general, just sort of in emerging markets, we've obviously seen a little bit of wobble to start the year, just given some of the currency movements. And then specific to India, I'm curious how much of it is sort of folks coming back online versus sort of a steadying out in the rupee versus just easing comps to kind of give us a little bit of recovery there.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Ross, I think India has clearly got a mixed bag of all those things. You've got these companies trying to restructure their financials based on a weaker rupee. You clearly have a weaker basis because of the lower growth in 2013. You've got regulatory issues that I think they thought were behind them. But I'm sure you saw the FDA issues with Ranbaxy just this week, so they're probably not all behind in India. But I'd say we're cautiously optimistic that we'll see better results in 2014 than we saw in 2013, and it's the sum total of all those factors. We don't see -- contrary to losing market share, we think we're holding our own to cautiously gaining some market share in a tough market. So that's the India story. The emerging markets is definitely not homogenous. We see areas in Asia that you'd characterize as emerging as generally very strong. Our performance outside of China and India in Asia was very good. And China, if you consider that emerging, continues to -- boy, coming out of 2013, we have just as many discussions with major opportunities in China as we had going into the year. So we see no underlying factors in China that suggest a slowing there. In the areas of the Middle East, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, very good performance, so continuing signs of those emerging economies investing in our kinds of technology. So as I say, I'm sure I'm being redundant, but there's broad-based results that we saw, and kind of building confidence is happening across the developed areas and most of the developing world. I'd say Brazil continues to raise question marks. It's a big economy, and we've seen some delays in Brazil, but it's not a big part of our emerging markets. So outside of that, I'd say, generally, it's all positive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Can you [ph] quantify the impact of currency mix and amortization on the gross margin in the fourth quarter?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "John, you want to...", "John A. Ornell", "Yes. Currency had about a 50 bp hit in Q4, about 70 for the full year.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "And amortization for...", "John A. Ornell", "The UNIFI we're talking about?", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, UNIFI was about 35 bps in Q4 and about 50 for the full year.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Great, that's helpful. And then could you elaborate on the impact of the Japanese stimulus funds in the fourth quarter in terms of revenue contribution? And should we expect a tailwind from that program into the first half of the year?", "Eugene G. Cassis", "Yes, I -- if I take a look at the -- this is Gene -- the factors that grow growth in Japan were heavily weighted towards government and academic spending. In fact, as we look at the first quarter, we're expecting some new tax policies to potentially get some of the pharmaceutical and industrial chemical spending to a higher level. So it's not clear that the government spending on research will be as pronounced in calendar year 2014 as it was in 2013. However, the base of comparison that we have on pharmaceutical and industrial chemical spending is favorable this year, and we see both economic stimulus policies by the Abe government as well as potential tax reform as being a positive to the nongovernmental spending in Japan.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Wondering how your communication and [ph] half of the QDa were full system sales as compared to bolt-ons. How does that compare versus your expectations? And do you think that's sustainable?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I'd say it's probably twice as loaded towards full systems, Dan, than we anticipated. We thought early on, particularly in a tough capital market, that customers would be more inclined to find available capital money to satisfy the detector but probably not the full system. And what we found was clearly a little surprising to us, that even though this wasn't a system that we had available so that they could budget for it this year, they were very strong in finding end-of-the-year money in order to purchase.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "And your views on the sustainability of that, of the QDa to pull through full LC sales?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "We don't think -- it's a mixed bag. I -- we certainly believe that there's a major opportunity to have accounts upgrade their detector, installed detector base to this new technology. But at the same time, it looks like, early on, there's going to be a strong desire to bring in full system. So I think what we're likely to see and what we could well be seeing is these accounts are buying 3 or 4 and bringing in full new systems in order to get the experience on it and to expose it to their broader laboratory environment. And once that happens, then they may proliferate it into their more existing systems. That could well be what we're seeing at this stage of the game.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Doug, when do you think the diagnostics market is meaningful? And where do you feel your, I guess, competitive position is as you kind of look at that in the years ahead?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Paul, I think, long term, we're very optimistic about the opportunities of our technology to serve emerging needs in the diagnostic marketplace. As you know, in -- we kind of satisfy it in a niche basis today with immunosuppressant drug monitoring and vitamin D and pain management applications and of course, neonatal screening. And mass spec has made some inroads, you see, in the rapid microbiology area. There's been some success there. But it's still kind of a niche-oriented marketplace for LC and particularly for mass spec. We are investing early funds in several areas. We're doing some things on a cooperative basis with some thought leaders in this area that we think will pay off, probably not early on in 2014, but as we look out past 2014 and to the broader area of things that are in classical diagnostics or broader than that in the kind of metabonomics, metabolomics and proteomics area. Looking at biomarkers, looking at early-on indicators of disease, we're seeing broad-scale interest there across many, many thought leaders. And it's blurring the identification of what's truly a diagnostic application versus what's an early-on biomarker application. So I think that's coming, but I think you're going to see the classical R&D and discovery applications certainly being serviced in 2014. Getting into the actual clinic probably comes later on.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And last, in the ultra-high pressure marketplace, I think there's some that try and grab a niche by having lower-pressure formats. Is -- does that really matter in ultra-high pressure, that you can offer a more of a dynamic range? Or is it just a game of getting the most atmospheres?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I think what you're probably hearing, Paul, is competitors trying to position themselves against the market leaders. And so if Waters has a particular position that's carved out in the UPC -- UPLC arena and others can't get there, they'll try their best to say, \"It doesn't matter.\" or \"We can do almost as good.\" I think what we find is that customers are looking for the best performance to fit their application, and we don't sell high pressure in and of itself. We sell the -- an instrument that best performs with the chemistries and the software that we bring. So in some applications, you absolutely can get the absolute best performance by utilizing the highest specs of a system, and in other applications, it's the chemistry and the software and service that most bring them into our realm. Art, you want to expand on that?", "Arthur G. Caputo", "Yes. The reality of the situation is that having been first to come out with a very intensified position in the ultra-performance area, if you look across our product line, we cover the complete gamut of just about everything that anybody's thinking about from all forms of mixing, all forms of pressure, all forms of interfacing. And so from our standpoint, this is all focused on solving specific problems. And most of the competitive positions against us pick 1 or 2 of those areas and try to emphasize it. If you go broadly, our position in the marketplace has not been affected much at all in the last 10 years as we introduced the products.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to ask a question on pricing. Can you maybe try and quantify how much pricing contributed to growth in 2013 versus 2012? And as a follow-up, what's baked into your assumptions for guidance this year?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "In a classical sense, pricing's a push, Isaac. We introduce new products, and to the extent that they establish a different price point, that certainly has a mix dynamic, we'd call it. But if you look at the prices of existing products, they're essentially equal across the years.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then for this year, same sort of effect...", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "You should anticipate the same dynamic. Margin -- and you can see that in the margin dynamics. The margins are stable x the currency dynamics that we've talked about.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then on the tax rate, just given the unusual cadence there you had last year, could you a little bit -- shed a little bit more color on the cadence this year? You talked about first quarter but maybe for the rest of this year.", "Eugene G. Cassis", "Yes. We're -- Isaac, we're expecting the tax rate to be between 15% and 16%, and the base of comparison is going to be most dramatic in the first quarter because we started last year off at a rate that included 2 U.S. R&D tax credits. But we're also not sure if we -- we don't discount the possibility of seeing an extension by the U.S. Congress into this year, but we haven't factored that yet into the -- into our assumptions.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "So if tax law stays the same, Isaac, you should see the rates stay stable right across the quarters, unlike last year, when the change in law mandated how we recorded it differently in the first quarter versus the rest of the year.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And then just last one, if I could, Doug. Any update from the board on succession planning? And specifically wondering if -- where you guys are in narrowing the field of candidates and whether or not that list includes internal candidates at this point.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Yes, sure. As I think everybody knows, the board has established a successor planning committee that is meeting regularly, has retained an executive search firm. But we're still early on in the process. There's no fast-burning fuse on this, and so I'd say the board is moving in a very confident but measured pace. And I wouldn't expect you to hear anything dramatic on this anytime soon. The board is definitely considering all possible strategic candidates, both internal and external, and it'll probably be the middle of the year before we are prepared to announce any update on this.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess, Doug, I wanted to just understand a little bit more about performance in the quarter, to the extent maybe you could characterize how much of a backlog drawdown you had and how much of a pull-forward in sales you had in this quarter versus what you're expecting from the first quarter of '14.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure, Amit. The simple answer is that if you look at our sales growth rate versus our orders growth rate, our orders growth rate was a little bit stronger than our sales growth rate. And backlog dynamics did not materially influence our fourth quarter results. So it's really still an open question as to whether the orders and the underlying strength that we saw in the fourth quarter, how much that portends for the future. And you can make a case that it's a stronger case for the future than we've seen, but as I've said, we're going to be a little cautious in how we approach 2014.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And a follow-up, I guess, on the gross margin side, I was hoping maybe Gene or John could talk a little bit more about the dynamics between the U.K. facility and the volume gains for 2014. Just trying to understand why gross margin won't tick up more. And I guess I have one more for you on China. The big players, GE, Siemens, Philips, have all talked about slowdowns there. Do you look at that in any sort of lag factor as potentially impacting the business later in '14 for you?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "The China question, I think, is a logical one for people to ask. I think, like a lot of areas, the fact that GE faces different dynamics in their infield in the United States or in Western Europe certainly comes as no surprise to you versus us. It's a different business. It has different dynamics behind it. We're in a totally different segment of the marketplace. We think -- and of course, we try to monitor this with how much funding is available and what the underlying requests for new applications are. I'd say, if anything, we see increasing demand in China rather than decreasing demand. And yes, at various times, we see there's a little funkiness with the release of funds, but I'd say we see no current signs or underlying signs of reduced demand across our major served marketplaces in China. And on the other question, Gene, you want to...", "Eugene G. Cassis", "Yes, on the gross margin front, Isaac, the guidance...", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Amit.", "Eugene G. Cassis", "Oh, I'm sorry, Amit. I'm sorry, Amit. On the gross margin front, we typically get manufacturing leverage on the instrumentation side. And in prior years, and when we have a typical growth rate in our instrument sales, we'd usually talk about 20 bps' worth of leverage on the manufacturing side. As we begin to look at what we hope is conservative guidance for 2014, we're thinking that, that sort of better absorption of fixed cost will likely be offset by some potential higher cost on the U.K. side, as well as some potential mix dynamic. So it's those factors that are driving our assumption of a flat gross margin. Looking at the effect of foreign currency, if we look at it on the top line, you're likely to see that the stronger euro kind of offsets the little weakness in the yen. And again, as you're looking at gross margins, be cognizant that it's really the yen and the pound that are the most important currencies to look at because we have a disproportionate amount of cost in goods sales that are pound denominated, and we have pretty low costs in Japan that are yen based.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Amit, I think it's important to note that when we talk about the differential cost of our Manchester facility, what our Manchester folks have been residing in for the past 17 years, to call it manufacturing sites that Charles Dickens would have thought was not adequate would be probably being fair. I mean, what they have produced in the kind of facilities that they've lived in has just been amazing, and we finally bit the bullet and have brought them into what we think of as the 21st century. But that's come at a cost, and it'll take us a year to kind of leaven those expenses. So that's why we're careful about describing -- bringing those costs. It'll take a while to grow into.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "My first question is looking at the incremental margin of about 30% in Q4, which was on a really strong revenue growth number, this is arguably a little bit lighter than what one might have expected on that type of revenue growth. I think you could say that's even more true given the extra day in the quarter, and that can have, I think, a favorable impact to the margin line, especially if you have a strong instrument performance. So could -- with all that in mind, could you address any concern related to the margin performance as some might argue that this performance could be indicative of you approaching peak margins? And I think this is especially relevant given that your 2014 guidance seems to imply that you're expecting incrementals only in the 20s on mid-single-digit top line growth.", "John A. Ornell", "The answer to that question is really based on the fact that the overage that we had in the fourth quarter put a fair number of our incentive plans in marginal payout situations from no payout as we made our way through the third quarter. So what you're seeing is an incremented spend in Q4 that's really making up for amounts that would have been accrued across the quarters had we anticipated that we would have reached this type of growth earlier in the year. There's no doubt that Q4 was much stronger than even our internal forecasts, and fortunately, for those in some of these geographies, there is a payout versus nothing. And you're really seeing the impact of all of that, like I said, all in the fourth quarter versus spread across the year. So I think from that perspective, you can understand how that surprise on the top line just translated to a little bit heavier spending down the P&L. On the tax front, another area that took a little bit of the wind out of the balloon as well, again, the overage was more a factor of production in the U.S., better experience with some of the mass specs that were coming out of the higher tax rate jurisdictions, so it moved the tax rate a little bit as well and took away some of the leverage all the way to the bottom line, as you might have expected. And I wouldn't say, really, any of that is indicative of the ability of the business to leverage itself going forward. These are just plans that generally pay out at a mid-single-digit rate. We've got them factored in to the guidance going forward. And I think we're being, hopefully, a bit conservative on the leverage that we're looking at for next year, and I would say if we're lucky enough to do a little bit better than the mid-single digit, you're more likely than not to see that create the type of leverage that you historically have seen from us as that may materialize as the year goes on.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So that's really helpful. And I guess, if we use that as a launching point into my follow-up, it seems like the guidance for incrementals, at least embedded into guidance for 2014, are a little bit lower than I would have expected. Again, that may just be a function of trying to be conservative as you head into the new year. But if you look at, again, and this is nothing new, your high capital mix as a percentage of revenue, visibility is clearly inherently challenging for you quarter-to-quarter. It always has been. It does seem like visibility has been a little bit more challenging than normal the last several quarters. I think it'd be useful to maybe just to talk through to the extent that there are some efforts that you guys have made over the last several quarters to improve visibility, if those are progressing and how relevant are those as we think about your outlook heading into 2014 and what looks like a wider range at the EPS lines than, I believe, what we've seen from you for a little while.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Sure, Doug. I mean, I think visibility in our business isn't -- most of the life science tools people is challenged because we work with such slim backlogs. And for all of us, most of our revenue is produced by orders that are generated in the quarter. So you're really challenged by looking at what you think is going to happen from quarter-to-quarter rather than some of the large industrial players who work with multi-quarters that are -- of sales are in their backlog. And so clearly, as we look at 2013, we went from flat to low 1% kind of growth coming in the first quarter, gradually increasing. We saw 4% kind of growth in the third quarter, and then very strong fourth quarter. So you're talking about -- and clearly, we influence that. We think we're doing better than most. I don't think most people are going to produce 10% organic growth, and the people we've seen so far are about 1/3 of that. So I do think we're doing better, but it's tough to string that -- what do you string next to that, and say the first quarter's going to be 12% growth? We think that's unlikely. Maybe we saw some end-of-the-year budget flush in some of our customers. We clearly saw a strong response to our new products, so we're encouraged about that. But where we think we're being rational and logical, as we say, the first quarter is probably not as strong as the fourth quarter. Where is it on that continuum? And certainly versus the first quarter of last year, we think it's better. We'll put a couple of quarters behind us, and we'll have greater confidence in how we proceed. But at this point in the year, as we look out a full year, we think where we are is a proper mix between the encouragement that we saw in the fourth quarter and the possibility that we'll see a blip or 2 as we go through this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Arias with UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe just one from me, bit of a bigger-picture question for Doug. Doug, when you think about the mass spec field for this year, do you have a view on what technology or workflow area you think the industry might focus on? 2012 seemed to be a bit of a QTof year. Last year, it looks like there was a triple quad focus. Is there anything or anywhere that you think is sort of ripe for attention in 2014?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "I think outside of the single quad area or the QDa that we're very optimistic about, which is really a chromatographer's platform, I think it's going to be a continuation of the high-end research-grade instruments, Dan. I think the interest in proteomics and metabonomics, this whole area of translational interest in getting molecules, either diagnostic molecules or therapeutic molecules, we're seeing from the cancer centers and from other therapeutic centers a huge amount of interest. And so they're looking for the most powerful technologies they can get, and they're very interested in both the physics of the high end, as well as the software. So I'd say that's the area that I'd look to sustaining high interest.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Doug, just what worries you about the underlying business strength as you go from Q4 to Q1?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Well, I guess I see more silver linings, Peter, than I see looming dark clouds. I think that -- I wish the large integrated pharmaceutical companies had some more strength to them. So in a macroeconomic sense, I don't see a lot of momentum coming out of big pharma, but I see a lot of continuing strength almost everywhere else in the life science arena. So I don't see, certainly, any short-term issues coming out of China, just the opposite. We see more interest coming out of China. So I'd say, India, it's still -- I think we're going to have to wait until later on in the year to see a real bounce in India. It's not likely we're going to see early-on return to growth in India. But we continue to see good conditions in the United States and I think improving conditions in Western Europe. So I think that, overall, is more silver lining than dark cloud.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. Just 2 quick ones. Can you tell us what about the TA deals you did and how much that's going to contribute to '14? And also, John, is this your last call?", "John A. Ornell", "I believe it is.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "John, you can take care of both of those.", "John A. Ornell", "Yes, it is, but I'm -- and I'm going to let Gene talk about 2014's impact from TA. But yes, it is. Thank you.", "Eugene G. Cassis", "Derik, I think as you look at TA business and the 2014 outlook, probably companies that we acquired before 2013 are going to have the biggest impact on the top line growth. So these are the assets that we acquired that involve high-temperature DSC, as well as biocalorimetry. The most recent couple of introductions are probably going to contribute less than a point of growth to the TA business this year, but potentially more significantly in 2015. So there is a little bit of a lag. If I think about the growth that TA had in 2013, we probably got a couple of points of growth over the full year from those high-temperature applications and biocalorimetry. But you had a very stable business in rheology and thermal analysis that had a nice growth foundation for that business.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "That was a couple of points for TA, Derik, de minimis for the total company.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, correct. Yes. So first of all, I'm just going to say, John, it's been a pleasure working with you the last 13 years. I can't believe it's been that long, but good luck. And then I'll go back to something more mundane on this is -- and I guess, can you quantify -- just given sort of the pickup in pharma, I mean, how much do you think was budget flush related? And I guess it goes to the question of sustainability of the pharma business. You sort of alluded that. I'm just wondering if you could quantify how much flush there could be from pent-up demand, you thought there could be in the quarter.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume", "Derik, I don't -- typically, when we talk about budget flush, we're talking about big pharma. And we're talking about the fact that their capital plans are getting finalized later in the years, and they're cautious early on in the years, and then they find themselves with money to spend at the end. We didn't see that from big pharma. So -- and we don't think that much of what we saw in the fourth quarter was kind of big pharma funding through biotech joint ventures or things like that. So while you always think that you could be seeing an end-of-the-year dynamic, as we look at what actually happened in our fourth quarter, we can't say particularly in our big U.S. accounts that we've seen much of that. So we're cautiously optimistic that this is more sustainable than a onetime event that dramatically influenced the fourth quarter.", "All right. Well, thank you, all, for taking the time to be with us. We certainly think we ended the fourth quarter on a high note, and we'll look forward to updating you on our next conference call.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter 2014 financial results conference call. With me on today's call is Gene Cassis, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, President of the Waters Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Treasurer and Investor Relations. As is our normal practice, I'll start with an overview of the quarter's business dynamics. Gene will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like Gene to cover the cautionary language.", "Gene Cassis", "Thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events and for the future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results for the company. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions, and that our actual results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from our present expectations, please see 10-K included with our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. Specifically, examine Part 1 under the caption Business Risk Factors. Also, see the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and Form 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is planned for July 2014.", "During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release that we issued this morning. In our discussions of results and operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials. This schedule is included in this morning's press release.", "Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, Gene. Well, clearly our first quarter results was significantly weaker than what we had expected. The strong business momentum that we saw at the close of 2013 was encouraging for us as we entered this year. However, as we moved through March, we began to see our bookings forecast weaken as pharmaceutical capital budget release has slowed and as our sales opportunities in China and Latin America were adversely affected by ordering delays, primarily from governmentally-funded programs.", "This weaker-than-expected topline performance combined with negative currency translation resulted in a decline in operating margins within the quarter. The year-over-year decline in our net profitability and adjusted earnings was also affected by an anticipated increase in our operating tax rate. As you might expect, we are most focused on the topline weakness as the currency and tax issues are likely to lessen in significance as we move through this year. Looking at the first quarter, our constant currency sales were flat with last year's and our adjusted earnings per share were down 14%.", "For the Waters Division, our pharmaceutical end market sales were flat in the quarter due to delayed budgetary releases, mostly notably in the United States. Global government and academic business slowed in the quarter in comparison to last year's strong results in Europe and Asia. We anticipate government-funded research in the US to improve this year as funding levels have increased, as the business pipeline looks strong and as the first quarter's results were promising.", "Geographically, weakness in Latin America and Canada and slower sales growth in China were below expectations for us in the quarter. In these markets, weaker-than-expected governmental spending adversely affected demand for our products. In China, we believe that the spending delays are temporary and that we will see a recovery in our sales growth. The business in China that we had anticipated booking and shipping in the first quarter is largely expected to be secured during 2014.", "Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan were strong in the quarter and grew at a high single-digit rate. In comparison to last year's first quarter, sales growth benefited from healthy increases in governmental and academic spending. In addition, sales for our products to Japanese industrial chemical customers suggest improving economic activity for these exporting companies. First quarter's positive momentum appears to be continuing in the second quarter, the first quarter in Japan's fiscal year.", "In the US, since staying in the Waters Division performance, sales was slightly down in the quarter in comparison to a mid single-digit increase in the 2013 quarter. Sales to pharmaceutical customers were flat in the quarter with budgetary delays and larger accounts offsetting stronger performance by smaller and specialty firms. Chemical analysis end markets in the US were also soft in the quarter and down from the prior year's more robust results. As I mentioned earlier, government and academic spending in the US was up in the first quarter and our pipeline for future sales is encouraging for our full year outlook.", "In general, our developing markets in Latin America were under pressure in the quarter due primarily to weaker governmental funding for academic research and from weaker demand for food and environmental applications. As I mentioned in prior calls, business in these developing markets can be lumpy and a single quarter's outcome has historically not been a harbinger of future results.", "Our European Waters Division business at constant currency was about flat in the first quarter. In contrast to the US, pharmaceutical sales were strong and up at a high single-digit rate, while government and academic spending was meaningfully down in comparison to a very strong 2013 performance.", "Our TA Division started off 2014 with a mid single-digit decline in shipments following a strong 2013. After a slow January, orders began to build through the quarter and the division closed the quarter with year-over-year orders growth and the backlog build. Within the quarter, a significant investment was made to integrate newly acquired product lines into the TA portfolio and to train the worldwide sales and service organizations on these new technologies.", "Geographically, Europe performed well in the quarter and enjoyed strong sales and orders growth. However, the division saw weakness in developing regions and the sales declined in the US. From a product perspective, rheology instruments had a strong quarter. Thermal systems saw a significant growth variability by region. And there was essentially no contribution from newly acquired product lines in the quarter. The outlook for TA for the second quarter and full year is for improvement across the division's product lines and regional markets. For the full year, TA expects to generate incremental sales growth from businesses acquired in 2013 and mid single-digit organic increases from core product offerings.", "Now I'll talk about some product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew 5% in the first quarter. Within the quarter, severe weather conditions, particularly in the US, and adverse impact on recurring revenue growth as restricted traveling conditions resulted in lower lab productivity. We believe underlying demand for chemistry and service offerings is marginally stronger than our first quarter sales growth may indicate.", "On the chemistry front, ACQUITY UPLC columns after 10 years in the market now represent our largest column product line with broad penetration across research-focused end markets. Water service business was generally strong across all regions as the trend toward higher penetration for service maintenance contracts was apparent in the quarter's results.", "Looking at our Waters Division instrument system sales and in contrast to the strong demand we saw late in 2013, UPLC MS system revenues were generally weaker than expected. For higher-end instruments, which incorporate advanced (inaudible) Q-Tof technology, the quarter's weaker performance was somewhat expected due to the particularly strong demand in the base quarter. We anticipate stronger sales growth from our SYNAPT and Xevo Q-Tof systems in subsequent quarters this year due to increased funding levels for government and academic research labs in the US. In addition, the release of capital budget to larger pharmaceutical accounts will benefit research instrument sales.", "Of greater significance was the year-over-year decline in tandem quadrupole instrument sales. We believe that this weakness in the first quarter is larger attributed to lower demand for food analysis and environmental testing systems, especially in Asian, Latin American and European markets. At this year's Pittsburgh conference in March, we introduced a new iron source technology for our Xevo TQ-S tandem quadrupole systems. This new ion source called ionKey couples the demonstrated advantages of our StepWave technology with an integrated (inaudible)-based ACQUITY column separation to deliver improved sensitivity for challenging applications.", "Initial customer demonstrations for this new technology has evidenced the competitive edge over more conventional source designs. Accordingly, we anticipate stronger high-end tandem quad system business as we go through 2014.", "On the chromatography front, ACQUITY instrument system sales benefited from another strong quarter for our ACQUITY QDa mass detector. Demand for this compact mass detection technology, it has the potential to redefine the capability of research-focused liquid chromatography, exceeded the unit shipment volume in the fourth quarter of 2013. The primary application area for this new detection technology continued to be in the area of small molecule drug research. And in the first quarter, we saw drug research customers purchase the QDa as a detection module for existing UPLC or HPLC systems as well as within new system orders.", "The demand that we saw in the first quarter is particularly encouraging, as we believe it represents a rather small proportion of the likely full year sales, given that many capital budgets were not released in the first quarter.", "Now we can take a look at the second quarter and the full year. On the new product front, we expect that the positive momentum established for the past two quarters for the ACQUITY QDa will continue to build through the year. And in addition and based on positive customer feedback, we expect that our tandem quadrupole position will be strengthened by ionKey technology and meaningful new product launches planned at the ASMS Conference this June. And in addition, we are confident that our recurring revenues will continue to contribute profitable and stable growth throughout the year.", "On the TA front, we will ship against the first quarter backlog and begin to meaningfully benefit from newly acquired product lines beginning the second quarter and through the year. If you look towards future M&A, we do see some encouraging opportunities to strengthen our technology portfolio and broaden our reach into medical research. I hope to provide you with more details later this year. In the meantime, it's likely that we'll see more M&A activity from our TA instruments division over the next few quarters, as we see more opportunity to continue with consistent and focused business acquisition plan here. As you know, a key deployment of our cash flow has been our share repurchase program and this will also continue in the future.", "Before passing you on to Gene, I want to say that we anticipate delivering full year 2014 results that are improved over the first quarter's performance. We have an exciting set of new products to drive business growth, most notably our ACQUITY QDa and new system launches planned for this year's ASMS Conference. The medium and longer-term outlook for our businesses in China and in fact all of Asia continue to be promising. And our competitive positions in these areas are strong. Academic and government spending in the US are expected to improve as governmental agencies will be better funded in 2014 in comparison to the budgetary pressures that we saw in 2013.", "I believe that 2014 will a successful for Waters, but I would have like to seen a stronger start than our first quarter's performance. Our new product flow is strong and we're well positioned in the most promising market segments. Organizationally, I feel we have fine-tuned our structure at the onset of this year to better address growth opportunities in a cost effective manner.", "On the leadership transition front, we are steadily progressing to identify and position my successor in a manner that is sure as a smooth transition and the continuation of the core strategies that have accounted for our long-term success. I hope to share with you more information on developments in this area in upcoming communications. In the meantime, we will direct our operational efforts to securing the business that was not captured in the first quarter and we'll modulate our spending to provide a return to operational leverage and earnings growth.", "Now I'd like to turn it over to Gene for a review of our financials.", "Gene Cassis", "Well, thank you, Doug, and good morning. Our first quarter revenues of $431 million were flat with last year, with currency translation neutral to sales. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were down 14% to $0.92 in comparison to earnings of $1.07 last year. This is primarily due to adverse currency effects and the higher operating tax rate. The tax rate for 2013 benefited from $3.5 million in US R&D tax credits. This opportunity is no longer available.", "On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.82 versus $1.39 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release that we issued this morning. The GAAP results in the first quarter of last year benefited from $31 million reduction in reserves of tax audits and the $3.5 million that I already mentioned in US R&D tax credits.", "Looking at our growth geographically and before foreign currency effects, the United States sales were down 2%, Europe was up 2%, Japan was up 8% and sales of Asia outside of Japan were up 1%. Rest of world sales notably including Latin America were down against the strong performance in the prior year's quarter.", "On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters Division, instrument system sales decreased by 5% and our recurring revenues were up by 5%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 1%. For our TA instruments division, constant currency sales including instruments and services decreased by 3%.", "Now I'd like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. Gross margins came in at 56.4%, down from the first quarter of last year, largely due to foreign currency exchange dynamics. SG&A expenses were up 1% as a result of continued tight spending controls and cost reductions from the modest restructuring earlier in the quarter. R&D expenses decreased by 2% due to higher than normal project-related expenses in the 2013 quarter.", "On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter came in as expected at 16%. This rate was meaningfully higher than in the first quarter of 2013 when we benefited from both the 2012 and 2013 R&D tax credits that I cited earlier. For full year 2014, we expect our operating tax rate to be between 15% and 16%.", "In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and share count came in at 85.9 million shares or approximately 1.3 million shares lower than in the first quarter of last year. This is a result of our share repurchase program.", "Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.85 billion and debt came in at $1.33 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of about $521 million. As for first quarter share repurchases, we bought 769,000 shares of our common stock for $86 million. This leaves 262 million remaining on our existing authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the first quarter of 2014, free cash came in at $108 million after funding $16 million worth of capital. Excluded from this amount is $6 million of investments associated with major facility expansion. On this front, we expect our new Wilmslow UK mass spectrometry center of excellence to be fully ready for occupancy and full utilization by mid this year.", "Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 85 days this quarter, up five days from the first quarter of last year. This increase is primarily the result of the particular timing of overseas sales in the quarter and of not signified change in the long-term character or quality of our receivables. In the quarter, inventories increased by $31 million as we built instrument systems to accommodate a stronger than realized shipment volume and as a consequence of our plan to build safety stock during the transition of manufacturing at our new UK mass spectrometry facility.", "Now I'd like to discuss our 2014 full year outlook. Clearly, we had a meaningful slower topline growth rate in the first quarter than what we had expected. We currently attribute this slow start largely to ordering delays and to a lesser extent shipping delays at our TA instruments division. In the upcoming quarters of 2014, we anticipate that positive new product momentum, the release of delayed capital budgets and the general improvement in our Asian businesses will allow us to recover most of the first quarter shortfall and to finish the year with the mid single-digit growth rate or similar to the constant currency growth rate that we delivered last year.", "On the currency translation front, at current rates, we are estimating that for the full year, currency will approximately neutral to our sales growth or potentially slightly dilutive to operating margins. Moving down the P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be around 59% and consistent with those for last year. Operating expenses are expected to be up moderately from 2013 levels or below our sales growth rate. Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million and we expect our full year operating tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%.", "Turning to share count, our full year average diluted share count is now expected to be reduced to around 84.5 million shares outstanding. This is a result of our continued share repurchases. Rolling all of this together, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.50. As we think about our expectations for the second quarter of 2014, we anticipate organic sales growth to improve from our first quarter's results and come in at or above the mid single-digit range. Currency translation at today's rates would be about neutral to sales growth. This level of growth in combination with continued tight expense control is expected to result in non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $1.15 to $1.27 in the quarter.", "Thank you. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, Gene. Operator, I think we can now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question is Brandon Couillard, Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies", "Gene, in terms of the provided outlook for the year, could you give us a breakdown of how you see that developing geographically and then by end market?", "Gene Cassis", "Generally for the full year outlook, it's pretty safe to look at our business in United States in our pharmaceutical business and assume that sort of the midpoint in our topline guidance is weighed around what our expectations are for that geography and for the pharmaceutical industry. Generally we anticipate that growth rate in Asia will be faster and we're a little bit more conservative on the full year growth rate in Europe. We started the year off pretty strong in Japan where we see positive signs coming into this quarter. So we're expecting that the Japanese rate may come in above the mean or maybe slightly below.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies", "And then in terms of the 2Q outlook seems to suggest that the snapback in the organic growth rate, was there something in the order book late in the quarter that gives you the confidence in that rebound sequentially? Any color you can give us in terms of the backlog for the period would be helpful. And then the EPS range implies a slightly wider band than is usual for Waters in terms of the $0.12 delta. Is there something unusual in that low and high-end range?", "Gene Cassis", "Yes, those are both good questions, Brandon. In terms of the backlog, the one thing that we cited already in Doug's commentary is that we did have positive growth for our TA instruments division, even though we reported slightly negative sales results. So we do have that backlog. We also want to point out that as you look at the base year comparison, for the full year, we had a relatively strong first and fourth quarters and the two middle quarters were relatively flat in terms of our instrumentation growth. There is a base of comparison benefit as we go from the first quarter to the second quarter.", "Also, as you look at the range of EPS and you look at what the expectations are on the topline, I'd say that the bottom of the range makes very minimal assumptions on the level of snapback that we see from the first quarter, in that our original expectation were that our growth rate in the second and third quarter would be stronger than the fourth quarter. But based on what we're seeing in the market now, we do have reason to believe that a portion of the delays that we saw in the first quarter will in fact come in, in the second quarter. At the high end of the guidance in the second quarter, we were anticipating a more full recovery of the sales delays that we saw in the first quarter. So that's one of the reasons for the expanded delays is kind of encapsulated in that rationale.", "Operator", "Our next question is Doug Schenkel, Cowen.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen", "Some of your peers have already talked about the delay of capital budgets in China. I don't think anyone has talked about delays in US pharma capital budget releases. Why do you think US pharma budget release delays would be more impactful for you? And I'm just wondering if at this point in Q2, you've seen some improvement in that dynamic specific to US pharma.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Doug, I think a couple of reasons. Number one, in many of those comparables, our large pharma business is more significant to us than it is for a number of our competitors. And so a delay there is probably going to show up more significantly in our results than in some of the competitors. We talk about this delay and it's not a dynamic that we haven't seen before in terms of late releases of big pharma's capital. And it's something that seems more common than I'd like to believe. But if you look at the request for quotes, there's typical time of turning a quote into an order and particularly look at the non-competitive that is labs that are almost totally dedicated to Waters business versus anyone else. You can see that this quarter, that time delay stretched much longer than has been typical from quote rates to delivering the orders.", "And obviously we've gone back at this since the quarter completed. We've queried those customers. We feel reasonably confident that as it affects us, these are delays and not lost business. Gene, do you want to add anything to that?", "Gene Cassis", "No, I think that's accurate. And you know what's interesting? We're seeing this continued trend of an increasing percentage of our pharmaceutical business moving towards more specialty pharmaceutical accounts, more on the buy-out side. And the top 15 accounts that at one point made up about 25% of our sales. That percentage continues to attenuate and it's now approaching closer to 10% of our sales.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen", "And I guess one or two quick related questions. I guess in hindsight, looking back at Q4, I'm just wondering if you think some of that Q4 strength in a quarter that was really great and where you attributed a lot of that strength to essentially recapturing revenues that you didn't get earlier in 2013, now if there's any signs that maybe there were some revenue pull-forward out of Q1, was that a dynamic? I know you guys talked about having a lot of momentum heading into Q2 and further into the year. But I am wondering if maybe you think Q4 maybe benefited to some extent in hindsight at the expense of Q1.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "It's not impossible. I'd say if you look at where we continued to see strength in the fourth quarter, the strength that we saw in China was a continuation. We saw a minor slowdown of releases in the third quarter in China. And that all kind of came back robustly in the fourth. I don't think there was much pull-forward in China. I think what we're seeing this quarter is a new dynamic there. And the pharmaceutical business that we saw in the developed countries in the fourth quarter, it's just kind of so typical of what we see in a budget-less year where that momentum starts off slow and builds up through the end of the year.", "The only thing I could say would be that our performance with the QDa was very strong in the fourth quarter. So there might have been a little bit of a disproportionate piece of business, because it hadn't been available for sale. But then you look at the QDa and the orders and shipments on the QDa were even strong in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter. So clearly, we ask ourselves many of the same questions, because we don't want to be diluted as we go forward. But we can't find too much significant evidence that the fourth quarter represented a big pull-out of the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question Amanda Murphy, William Blair.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair", "I just had a question on the QDa. So you mentioned that some of the platforms were slow to people who already had a solution. I'm curious just can you give us a perspective on how many are buying from existing platforms versus how many are buying QDa as part of a new platform? Just trying to get a sense of how penetrated the existing opportunity is.", "Gene Cassis", "To the last point, I think we're still very much at the beginning in terms of looking at penetration rates. And we think that there's a tremendously large market for research-focused chromatographs that can benefit from this technology. When you take a look at the fourth quarter last year, we were somewhat surprised to see how many of the QDa technology modules were sold as part of a complete system package. There's about half of them in the quarter. And we saw that people had some money at the end of the year and they decided to invest in a complete system at a rate that was a little bit higher than what we anticipated.", "If I look at this last quarter, two-thirds of the instruments that we sold in the first quarter were additions to existing chromatographic systems, which was much more in line with what we were envisioning last year. So although the unit volume was up in terms of modules shipped in the quarter, from a revenue point of view, the fourth quarter of 2013 was comparable to what we saw in the first quarter of 2014 and kind of consistent with the outlook that we had coming into this year that the QDa could contribute quite a point of growth for the whole company in full year 2014. And I'd also just add that in terms of the uptake of this technology continues to be most sought after by people doing small molecules work research.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair", "And have you guys said how much of your LC install base you think might be candidates for a QDa and then also what the ASP differences are if you were to buy as an add-on versus as part of a broader system?", "Gene Cassis", "Generally speaking, we look at the install base of chromatographs, Waters and non-Waters, we think it's pretty evenly divided between those that are being used for research purposes and those that are being used for quality control compliance type purposes. And the key market in the short term for QDa technology is going to be on the research side. So there is a tremendously large install base of instruments that are using photodiode array technology. And the usage of that technology implies that the customer is interested in getting qualitative research or compound identification. So we think that this customer base, which might be a quarter to a third of the install base of chromatographs, is a great candidate for QDa technology.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "And in terms of looking at pricing for this technology, we're able to offer a complete system for less than $100,000, very comprehensive system. And we're able to offer an upgrade to an existing system for something less than $40,000. We think these price points are very attractive for the end markets.", "Operator", "Our next question is Jon Groberg, Macquarie.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "I'm just looking at your new guidance and if you look back over the last three years now, every year has something different, but kind of 2% EPS growth, 2% mid single-digit EPS growth this year. I'm just curious if anything that you're seeing in terms of newer challenges in the business. Maybe can you talk about how that is impacting, if it is impacting, the type of candidates that you're looking at to succeed you to run Waters?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think the answer is no, we think that the basic Waters strategy and the strength that we've seen over the years hasn't and shouldn't change. It's not like we believe that long-term opportunities in the high value-added technologies that we bring to market and has sustained our growth over the years has petered out. I think if you look at the last couple of years, I mean look at last year in particular, if the yen had stayed stable, our earnings would have grown double-digits or thereabout. So yeah, I do think it's possible to pull things in and out of any given year. But the focus that we have on developing new technologies and new products with this opportunity to selectively enhance our product portfolios in areas that directly related to what we do, we would currently focus more on TA than anywhere else. But the emerging medical applications and clinical diagnostic software, we think are some real opportunities for us. So I'd say we haven't changed the specs on what we're looking for and we haven't changed what we think the success of Waters long-term is likely to be.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "And, Doug, would you say in terms of the process, are you pleased with the candidates you're seeing? I know you're going to say you hope to update more in the future, but just kind of maybe you can give us a little bit more color on the process?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think the process has shown that there is a broad array of very interesting candidates who have shown real interest in the opportunity, Jon. I won't say that that surprises me. It's a great company with great technology and great opportunity, but it's nice to see that as you go out there that's reinforced by the response that we're getting from very qualified candidate.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "Obviously the gross margin I mean down to 56% was one of the weakest just going back over the year, it's a pretty weak number. Are you still expecting 59% for the year? Can you maybe just talk a little bit about why it was so weak in the first quarter and why your comps would be able to get back to a more normalized number for the year?", "Gene Cassis", "Yeah, the year-over-year comparison going from the first quarter of last year, Jon, to first quarter of this year, you need a little bit more detail to fully understand the dynamic there. The biggest thing is the currency impact on gross margin. So the lion's share of the difference that you see between last year's gross margin and the gross margin that we delivered in the first quarter is related to currency. And this includes the strong flow-through that we get in Japan, where last year for most of the first quarter, we're done with the yen that was at around 92 average (inaudible) this year.", "Also on the currency, we had the pound movement in direction that was unfavorable to us. So it had the impact of increasing our cost of goods sold for product that sold to United Kingdom. So those are the big dynamics. Now superimposed on that, there is a natural progression of gross margin with volume, as you look at Waters over a one year period. So the reduced volume that we had in the first quarter combined with the typically lower volume that you get in the first quarter contributed to less absorption of fixed cost in the quarter and had negative impact on gross margins. So broadly speaking, it's that dynamic as well as the currency dynamic that caused the 56%-plus gross margin for Waters.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "But just so I'm clear, If the currency stayed where they are, the yen and the pound, how do you make it up in the next few quarters?", "Gene Cassis", "In fact, there is a big difference in the value of the yen as you move from the first quarter last year to the second quarter. So as you go and take a look at how the yen progressed across the year, you'll see that as we come into the second quarter, that'll be much more favorable. But pound, I made some commentary that foreign exchange might over the full year be a little bit dilutive. If the pound continues to strengthen, well, that can work against us. But as we go from the first quarter to the second quarter, implied in the guidance is a recovery in the growth of our instrumentation business and that will have a positive effect on our cost absorption.", "Operator", "Our next question is Paul Knight, Janney Capital Markets.", "Paul Knight - Janney Capital Markets", "Hi, Doug, I think on some of the same topic and that is operating margins were severely detrimental in the quarter. And is that due to in China when you sell the product, you're probably operating at a higher level of profitability than maybe other markets, or what are the dynamics going on that kind of cause that detrimental to occur?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The margins we get around the world, they're remarkably consistent, certainly at the gross margin level. So the effect of the shortfall in China would be really no different than what we'd see from a shortfall in the United States. So if you look your way down P&L, the shortfall in earnings and clearly the shortfall in sales had a significant impact on us. So we were $17 million, $18 million shy of where we thought we were going to be for all the reasons that Gene talked about. Now at the same time, we under-spent SG&A, because we're careful and that's traditionally our bent.", "So SG&A spending is clearly under control. But when you're flat at the topline, it's still tough to get any leverage out of that. So the real story on the profitability side was the gross margin line. And that's 2.5 points that Gene talked about largely affected by currency and the fact that we have such a shortfall on the instrumentation mix in this quarter. So we see ways for that to reverse itself as we go forward in 2014. We think that's a reasonable forecast. And if the currency behaves itself, it seems to be more or less with a little bit of question on the pound side, we think that recovers.", "Paul Knight - Janney Capital Markets", "With the completion of the UK facility, what portion of product is made in the UK now?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "If I take a look at our mass spectrometry center of excellence in Wilmslow, the high-end mass spectrometry that incorporate time of flight technology is primarily manufactured in United Kingdom. If I take a look at mass spectrometers that heavily utilize quadrupole technology, the lion's share of production is at our Wexford, Ireland facility. So most of this facility is not dedicated to manufacturing, Paul. We still are manufacturing more intensely in Ireland for our mass spec products. So it's really a focus on R&D, marketing and administration.", "Operator", "Next question is Dan Leonard with Leerink.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Justin on for Dan and thank you for the questions. Just was curious if you could elaborate on what you saw in China this quarter, maybe across product lines and some of the end markets and then maybe hone in on the change in kind of dynamics you saw there or alluded to in your prepared remarks.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think that surprised us versus our original expectations is the fact that the incoming quote rates and the desires on the part of customers is still very robust, still looks like kind of what we saw in typically in the last several years. As a matter of fact, the number of very large projects are with customers being very interested in talking to us about outfitting labs in a multiple instrument levels is going up. So the amount of grass roots level of interest, if anything, I think is growing. What we clearly saw was getting those quotes through the orders phase and then through the banking system to approve the shipment and then the payment of the orders, that all slowed in the first quarter. And that's kind of what we've spent a lot of time and researching the current status, why do we think that that's more or less a temporary dynamic. There's some risk that that issue will continue, but we don't think so. We think that we saw a little of this in the third quarter last year that then corrected itself in the fourth quarter. We're anticipating that our business for the year in China will be less than we originally forecasted, but that this significant slowdown will not repeat in the second quarter.", "Gene, you have anything to add to that?", "Gene Cassis", "Just that if you look at our position in China historically, it's been a consistent year-over-year double-digit compounded average growth rate business for us. We don't see a very meaningful change in that long-term trajectory. But we also recognize that a significant portion of our business in China is funded by governmental agencies. So I guess that's a risk factor going forward as you begin to think about how governmental spending might have an impact on our business.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Can you talk a little bit about customer receptivity to the ionKey and then what kind of contribution to topline growth you're banking on this here from that product?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Do you want to talk about the initial customer reaction?", "Gene Cassis", "Sure. The primary aspect of the ionKey is it's designed for applications where you're dealing with very small samples requiring very high sensitivity. Traditionally standard chromatographs were used, which in conjunction with mass spectrometer made for a fairly sophisticated and complex system with a lot of plumbing and tubing. The ionKey for the lack of a better term is almost a solid state chip-based system that really replicates the performance levels that you find with the ACQUITY-based type performance systems. So about two years prior to its introduction, we tested it roughly 25 major pharmaceutical houses with people doing high sensitivity regulated bio analysis. It probably had one of the most expensive free introduction evaluation that then got outstanding review.", "So as we have rolled it into the marketplace, the receptiveness in a fairly narrow space, which again is low-volume high sensitivity applications, typically clinical type trials and so forth, is quite strong. Having said that, these systems are sold in a fairly high-end mass spectrometry based systems. And they're going into a market segment that is well established. The acceptance probably will take anywhere from six to 18 months for the early adopters now in the go to marketplace to pick up on this technology and find its advantages. So we think it has a fairly large audience in the pharmaceutical industry, but we also believe, because it's regulated and it will require a shift from traditional methods, it's not going to be an overnight transition. It will take a while. But we're very excited about the technology. The customers are excited. And we think that the future is very promising. And it will probably represent the direction of separations technology on the front end of these types of mass spec systems.", "Operator", "Our next question is Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs", "I just want to ask one on the pricing environment in general, maybe talk a little bit about what's embedded in your guidance this year and what you've seen year-to-date.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I would say there's been no dramatic changes in the pricing environment. You always, Isaac, have some territory around the world that pops up out of the vacuum that all of a sudden the competitor seems to go on a rampage of offering special discounts. But those things happen in kind of very small areas. And we frankly don't see a broad dynamic of significant difficult price competition. It's a very competitive market. So we're always cognizant of what's going on. Certainly if you just look at China, for example, it wasn't that all of a sudden somebody started charging lower prices. We haven't seen those kinds of dynamics. It's more or less business as usual, as we've seen over the last several years.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs", "And then just a follow-up would be on your visibility in the drug industry. We're obviously facing a potentially unprecedented year in M&A there. And if you could just remind us, if we think about the cadence of spend from those customers, when you have M&A out there, is it the kind of thing where you have some sense of visibility on when the budget dollars get held up versus when they get released and spending comes back to normal, so to speak? And if so, how much of that's kind of discounted in your current guidance? I think this question might have been touched on earlier, but I was just hoping to tease out some more specifics relying on past precedent?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "First of all, I'd say in terms of a real merger, nothing is really underway. I mean you see the transactions going on between Glaxo and Novartis and restructuring those R&D programs. But that aside, certainly the Pfizer AstraZeneca, if it ever happened, wouldn't affect this year. And so on the largest front, I don't think you're likely to see those M&A activities affect 2014. To the extent that they do happen, I'd say we've seen both kinds of effects in the last, Christ, go back over 10 years. Some of those deals were aimed largely at sales force consolidation and back-office and G&A. And I'd say in many of those cases, you always see somewhat of a delay, but a pretty rapid return to a normal run rate of business.", "In more recent years, we've seen more of a focus on R&D organizations and in fact have seen a more significant short-term effect on R&D procurement as they have consolidated R&D operations and significantly in some cases cut back. What we've clearly seen in our broad pharmaceutical marketplace is that the strength in the activity in the generic and the specialty pharma and biotech has made up for that slowdown in the consolidation of big pharma. But that's where I'd say you really have to look at the specifics of any transaction. And who knows if a US company really gets $100 million or more in tax benefits from doing this, maybe they'll have more money to spend on R&D.", "Operator", "Next question is Jeff Elliott, Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird", "Can you talk a little bit more about the triple quad, what do you see in there? Is there a change in the competitive environment or what's going on?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, Gene can chime in here too. The triple quad market I'd say is one of the most competitive segments of the mass spectrometry market. It traditionally has been a marketplace where something happens with one product introduction and they kind of hold up a stronger position for a while. And then a competitor adjusts and comes back. And I'd say that happens almost year-by-year. No one gets knocked out of the box, but they have to respond to specific introductions. With us, I think you've seen us to some extent respond with things like ionKey and in terms of system configurations. But I do think it's fair to say that we've seen a number of competitors' introductions in the triple quad market in the past 09 to 12 months, and that probably had some effect on what's going on in the marketplace. And you'll see us respond over the next nine to 12 months with our own introductions, some included in ASMS. And I think this is just the market that we live in.", "Gene Cassis", "As we look at the tandem quadrupole market, we see the largest segment of that market being for regulated bio analysis. And based on the performance of our Xevo and Xevo TQ-S, over the past few years, we've made some inroads into a market that has historically been a tougher one for us. Over that time though, I think we've made very good penetration into the food safety testing and environmental segments. So we're disproportionately represented in our market mix towards these applied markets. And I'd say that as you look at these applied markets by quarter, it tends to be a lumpier business. As regulations come into place, you get a surge in business. And it feels good then, but then a year later, it's in the base. So I would say along with the dynamics that Doug pointed out that looking at what's changed year-over-year from us, it's just as not as robust a market for some of these applied market opportunities.", "Operator", "Tim Evans, Wells Fargo Securities.", "Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities", "Gene, I think you said at the earlier part of the call that you got basically no contribution from acquisition revenue, inorganic revenue in the quarter. But it looks at you spent like maybe about $45 million dollars on acquisitions since the middle of 2013. Can you comment there on what's going on? I don't think you're buying zero revenue company there, are you?", "Gene Cassis", "Well, if I take a look at the acquisitions that were made last year and look at those for the TA instruments group specifically, we made about four acquisitions. We did not get product revenue for those acquisitions within the TA instruments division. Now within the Waters Division, we also made acquisitions last year, but they were technology-based. So it was technology that's embedded primarily in our SYNAPT line of mass spectrometers. So it's a long-term with technology play rather than revenue stream that we acquire. So that's the reason why you're not seeing revenue associated with the Waters Division acquisition, because we really were not buying revenue, we were buying technology.", "And on the TA side, we have devoted significant amount of time during the last quarter towards training the new organization and getting manufacturing processes for future growth this year. And I think you'll begin to see in the second quarter and beyond some nice contribution from the TA acquisition.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yeah, Tim, the TA acquisitions were largely done late in the year. And they were smaller organizations. In many cases, they're doing businesses through distributors. And so we decided as part of the transactions to take the time and renegotiations, we're doing direct. We had to renegotiate agreements in many cases and thought that it'd be much cleaner to not press these products through an old distribution channel, but to take our time and drive it out there later in the year. So that's why you're seeing a de minimis effect in the early part of the year. But these sales will grow significantly as we move through the year.", "Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities", "And can you just make a real quick comment on what you saw in the quarter?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yeah, our overall business in India was flat in the quarter, which is probably a little bit better than it was on average last year. And I still think we're seeing the effect of the regulatory issues in the generic drug manufacturers in India. And we're beginning to see the (inaudible) beginning to settle down. So we have optimism that as we get later in this year, we could see an improvement in our India business.", "Operator", "Our next question is Derik De Bruin.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I don't mean to harp on this, but I'm a little bit surprised that you're maintaining your organic revenue growth guidance of mid single-digits, given historically what's happened. I mean there has been purchasing delays, as people have looked (inaudible). And also in emerging markets, you're not as strong. Academic and government markets, they're not strong as they were in the past. Even the applied markets are slowing. I'm just a little bit curious as to why you still think that this time is different from what we've seen in the past. I'm still just a little bit flabbergasted.", "Gene Cassis", "I think as you begin to look at the mid single-digit growth rate assumption, here're some of the basis tenets that are beneath that. We think that market conditions are not drastically different from what we experienced last year. And last year, our constant currency growth rate was a little bit better than 5%. If I take a look at the components that drive our growth, we have roughly half of our business within the broad definition of recurring revenue. And historically, it's grown at a consistent mid single-digit or better rate. So if we think about the recurring revenues growing at a rate that's historically in line, you'd be looking at 5%, 6%, 7% growth rate, which brings about 3 points of growth to the corporation. So superimposed on that, we think that we have some opportunities this year with products like the QDa and with the TA acquisitions to ensure a certain level of instrumentation growth above the recurring revenue growth.", "So when you begin to rip the business apart that way, you think about what the implications are for the core revenues for instruments. They're really not that dramatic to get you to the 5%-plus level. So that's the basic understanding that brought us to this position.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think, Derik, to be fair, if you look at one of the most significant shortcoming in the quarter, China was a big piece of it. And so if you look at the risk/reward equation, we clearly think that the rest of the year in China isn't going to be a continuation of the first quarter. We think we have analyzed that to a level that we're not crazy in that assumption. In many ways, we're looking at significant projects that would even add to that enthusiasm. But they're not in hand yet. So we're not going to take them to the bank. But I would admit that China is a swing. If we're not right and China doesn't come back, but we don't think China can cut off forever their commitment to this technology. And so that's an important part of why we think the future is better than the first quarter.", "Well, thank you, all, for hanging with us this quarter. It was clearly not the strongest quarter that we've had recently. And we hope to be talking to you on a more enthusiastic bent next quarter. So thanks again and we'll see you in the future. Bye, bye.", "Operator", "This does conclude the conference for today and all participants may disconnect at this time.

Welcome to Waters Corporation Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today\u2019s call is Gene Cassis, the Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations. As is our normal practice, I\u2019ll start with an overview of the quarter\u2019s business, and Gene will follow with details of our financial results and then update you with our outlook for the third quarter and for the full year. And before we get going, I\u2019d like Gene to cover the cautionary language.", "Gene Cassis", "Thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for quarter three and full year 2014. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events and results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, please see our 10-K annual report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning\u2019s press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2014.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly compatible GAAP measures is attached in the company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning\u2019s press release. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, Gene. Well, our second quarter\u2019s results were largely in line with our expectations. Improved demand from our global pharmaceutical customers and strong overall sales growth in the United States contributed nicely to our topline. In comparison to the first quarter, higher sales volume, more favorable currency translation, and continued cost controls resulted in improved operational leverage and double-digit growth in our adjusted earnings per share.", "Looking at the second quarter, our constant currency sales were up 6% and our adjusted earnings per share grew at 13%. For the Waters Division, organic sales growth was 6% and benefited from stronger shipment volume to pharmaceutical end markets. Budgetary delays that we had cited in our April call resulted in a shift of business into the second quarter, most significantly in the U.S.", "Overall sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical segment were up 8% in the quarter and up 5% through the first half of 2014. Global government and academic business declined moderately in the quarter with growth in the U.S. offset by continued weakness in China and a quarterly decline in Europe.", "This European decline was primarily due to very strong growth in the prior year\u2019s results. We anticipate government-funded instrument sales in the U.S. to continue to increase during the second half of this year and are also seeing signs that governmental spending in China is beginning to improve. Our combined industrial chemical and chemical analysis businesses grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter and benefited from a nice pickup in most developing markets.", "Geographically, we saw varying levels of strength across our key regions. Coming into the quarter, we were very focused on monitoring business conditions in China. As you may recall, a drop in order volume had an adverse effect on our first quarter results, and that we had attributed this lower business flow to delays in placing orders at governmentally-funded institutions. Through most of the second quarter, we continued to see a similar dynamic, and consequently finished the quarter with a double-digit decline in China\u2019s sales. However, during the closing weeks of the quarter, we began to see improving governmental orders, and by the close of the quarter and in contrast of the first quarter, we finished with a moderate increase in orders and a nice sequential pickup in orders in comparison to the first quarter results.", "Needless to say, we are continuing to watch for signs of improving momentum in China, and at this time, we feel encouraged by the second quarter\u2019s ordering trends that suggest a return to growth in orders and sales during the second half of 2014.", "Sales growth in the U.S. was encouraging in the second quarter. For the Waters Division, sales were up 9% with particular strength in governmentally-funded accounts and with the solid performance in our pharmaceutical business. Elsewhere in the Americas, business trends were very positive and recovered nicely from a slow first-quarter start. Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan moderately increased in the quarter and were up around 8% through the first half of 2014.", "In the quarter, meaningful improvements in pharmaceutical and industrial chemical accounts were tempered by declines in public sector spending. Our business in Asia outside of China and Japan was robust in the second quarter. India, in particular, saw a healthy and long-awaited return to double-digit sales growth as generic drug firms resumed adding new instruments and replacing old ones. In addition, the stability of the rupee and a general sense of optimism following the recent election cycle seemed to be contributing to more favorable business conditions.", "Our European Waters Division business at constant currency grew modestly in the second quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid-single digits, while our government and academic business declined in comparison to a double-digit increase in the 2013 quarter.", "Looking at our TA Instruments division, sales were up 9% in the quarter. Within the quarter, we began to see sales from recently acquired businesses contributing to the division\u2019s topline performance. In general, sales growth for TA was strongest in developed markets, including the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Underlying demand for TA\u2019s products and services appears to be strengthening as we move into the second half of 2014, and we are looking to achieve mid to high single-digit topline growth in the second half of the year.", "Now, I would like to turn to some product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew 7% in the second quarter. Waters\u2019 service business was generally strong across all major regions as the trend toward higher penetration for service maintenance contracts was apparent in the quarter\u2019s results.", "On the chemistry front, our new line of LC columns called CORTECS was recognized as a significant scientific achievement by R&D Magazine with the prestigious R&D 100 Award. This new CORTECS packing product line is complementary to our broad line of UPLC chemistry offerings, and will further expand the application reach of UPLC technology, especially for UPLC MS applications.", "Waters Division instrument system sales grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. Demand improved most significantly in the U.S. where our more advanced instrument systems benefited from higher funding for governmentally-supported labs and improved spending by pharmaceutical customers. Overall, sales for research-focused UPLC MS systems in the U.S. were up double digits. Outside of the Americas, sales in Europe for research UPLC MS systems declined against the strong base in 2013. In Asia, shipment volumes declined as orders in China were booked too late in the quarter to complete shipments and recognize revenue.", "Demand for our tandem quadrupole systems improved in the second quarter in comparison to our first quarter\u2019s results. The improvements that we saw were most apparent in the U.S. with stronger pharmaceutical demand and an increase in clinical diagnostic business drove our growth. At this year\u2019s ASMS conference in June, Waters showcased a range of new systems offerings. Most significantly, we introduced two new Xevo benchtop mass spectrometers, the Xevo G2-XS QTof and the Xevo TQ-S micro. Each of these new offerings provides researchers with a differentiated level of performance and value in a compact benchtop design. Initial customer feedback has been very positive, and we are anticipating meaningful shipment volumes of these new systems in the second half of 2014. Earlier in the year at the Pittsburgh conference, we introduced ionKey technology for our Xevo TQ-S tandem quadrupole system. This advanced Ion Source couples the demonstrated advantages of our StepWave technology with an integrated tile-based ACQUITY column separation to deliver improved sensitivity for challenging applications.", "In the second quarter, adoption of this technology had a positive effect on our high performance Xevo TQ-S orders and sales. Based on the demonstrated advantages of this new technology source, we announced at ASMS that ionKey will be available as an option for a wider range of our tandem quadrupole and top platforms.", "On a chromatography front, ACQUITY instrument system sales benefited from another strong quarter for our ACQUITY QDA mass detector. The primary application area for this new detection technology continued to be in the area of small molecule drug research, and in the second quarter, we saw drug research customers purchase the QDA as a detection module for existing UPLC or HPLC systems as well as within new system orders. The sales volume associated with the QDA through the first half of 2014 is consistent with an opportunity to generate meaningful and largely incremental sales from this new mass detector.", "Now, I would like to turn to our outlook for the second half of 2014. Broadly speaking, we are anticipating sales growth in the third and fourth quarter of 2014 that will result in full-year constant currency mid-single-digit growth for the corporation. For the Waters division, this growth anticipates pharmaceutical demand that is consistent with the first half\u2019s results, continued growth in governmental and academic spending in the U.S., and a return to positive growth in our China business. The division\u2019s recurring revenues are envisioned as continuing to grow at a solid mid-single-digit range. If you look at TA instruments, we anticipate seeing more sales associated with the recently acquired product lines and a high-single-digit topline full-year growth rate.", "On the M&A front and for the Waters division, we see opportunities to benefit our long-term initiatives in applications such as food safety testing, microbiology, and clinical diagnostics by licensing and acquiring innovative technologies. In fact, later today we plan to issue a press release that will describe a technology investment that is directed towards future growth in these areas. For our TA division, we will likely continue a consistent and focused business acquisition plan. However, given our primary focus on driving organic growth, we plan to continue to deploy the lion\u2019s share of our strong cash generation on our share repurchase program.", "And finally on leadership transition front, we continue to progress in the search for my successor. During the second quarter, we have continued to identify well qualified executives whose candidacies are now being further developed. Though we are optimistic about completing a transition within the timeframe we have already discussed, our primary focus will be to ensure a smooth succession that will result in the retention of the core tenants of our focused and proven business strategy. I will look forward to sharing with you more information on developments in this area in the upcoming quarters.", "In the meantime, we will direct our operational efforts towards building on the positive business momentum that drove our second quarter\u2019s performance and leverage the advantages of our recent new product launches.", "Now, I would like to turn to Gene for a review of our financials and an update on our outlook.", "Gene Cassis", "Thank you, Doug, and again good morning.", "In the second quarter, our sales came in at $482 million, an increase of 7% over last year with currency translation adding about 1 percentage point to sales. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 13% to $1.22. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $1.13 versus $1.03 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release that was issued this morning.", "Looking at our growth geographically and before foreign currency effects, U.S. sales were up 11%, Europe was up 2%, Japan up 4%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were also up 4%. Strong sales growth in India helped offset a decline in China. Rest of world sales notably including Latin America were up 10%.", "On the products front, and again in constant currency and within the Waters division, instrument sales increased by 5% and our recurring revenues grew by 7%. In all, the Waters division sales were up 6%. For our TA instruments division, constant currency sales including instruments and services increased by 9%.", "Now, I would like to comment on our second quarter\u2019s non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins came in at 58.1% versus 58.3% in the second quarter last year. SG&A expenses were up about 3% before foreign currency effects, which added another 2 percentage points. R&D expenses increased 6% before foreign currency translation, and notably the British pound contributed to add another 3 points to the reported growth number.", "On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter came in at about a point lower than expected and at 14%. This favorability was primarily due to production mix dynamics. For the full year 2014, we now expect our operating tax rate to be between 14% and 15%. In the quarter, net interest expense was at $6 million and share account came in at 85.2 million shares or approximately 1.4 million shares lower than in the second quarter last year, a net result of our share repurchase program.", "Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.9 billion, and debt totaled $1.4 billion bringing us to a net cash position of $524 million. As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 908,000 shares of our common stock for $93 million. In May 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a new three-year share repurchase program for $750 million while extending the duration of a previously authorized program. So, in all, we have more than $900 million in authorized share repurchases remaining when both programs are considered.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the second quarter, free cash flow came in at $110 million after funding $17 million of capital. Excluded from this amount was $5 million of investment associated with major facility expansion and a one-time $21 million pension contribution in Europe. Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 78 days this quarter, up 2 days from the second quarter last year. In the quarter, inventories increased by $6 million in comparison to the first quarter to accommodate new ASMS product launches.", "Now I will discuss our 2014 full-year outlook. For the second half of 2014, we anticipate positive new product momentum, a continuation of growth in our pharmaceutical markets and in our recurring revenues, and we also anticipate a general improvement in our Chinese business. With these dynamics in play, we expect to finish the year with a mid-single-digit topline sales growth. On the currency translation front and at current exchange rates, we are estimating that our full year \u2013 that for the full year, currency will be approximately neutral to sales growth.", "Moving down the P&L, gross margins for the full year are expected to be between 58.5% and 59% as we anticipate stronger than previously envisioned headwinds from foreign currency. In particular, the British pound which has continued to strengthen year-to-date. Operating expenses at constant currency are expected to be up moderately from 2013 levels and below our sales growth. Moving down to the operated \u2013 moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million, and we expect our full-year operating tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%.", "Turning to share count, our full year average diluted share count is expected to be reduced to around 48.5 million shares outstanding as a result of our continued\u2026", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Not 48.", "Gene Cassis", "I\u2019m sorry 84, I\u2019m sorry, 84.5 million shares outstanding as a result of continued share repurchases. Thank you, Doug. Rolling all of this together, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.40. As we think about our expectations for the third quarter of 2014, we anticipate organic sales growth to come in at or above mid-single-digit range. Currency translation at today\u2019s rate would be about neutral to sales growth. This level of sales growth is expected to result in operating leverage that is less than what we delivered in the second quarter. This is due to the timing of variable compensation expenses in the base year. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be within a range of $1.22 to $1.32. That\u2019s it. Thank you. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, Gene. And operator, I think we can now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Doug, could you elaborate on what you saw in terms of mass spec demand on a year-over-year basis and give us some more color both across technology verticals and end markets? One of your competitors had cited strength in the academic market, curious what you saw there?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure. Overall, the underlying strength in our mass spec business was somewhat camouflaged by the lateness of the orders. So, overall we saw mid to high single-digit orders rate growth, but particularly in China, a lot of those orders came in late in the quarter and you didn\u2019t see it reflected in revenue. So I think, we are seeing good decent demand. ASMS came a little later this year than it normally does, so we did see some customers delaying decision-making, and some of that I think clearly slipped out of the second quarter, and we\u2019ll see more momentum on those new introductions coming in the second half of the year. Gene, do you want to talk about the academic dynamics or at least the --?", "Gene Cassis", "Yes, it\u2019s interesting that in the first half of last year, we had particularly strong academic uptick in our SYNAPT and QTof business in Europe, and of course that\u2019s in the base this year. Now, we\u2019re beginning to see sort of an echo effect in the U.S. as governmental spending in the U.S. is better funded this year. So, I would say that, key leading dynamics are improved spending by governmental accounts for high-end mass spectrometry products in the U.S., and another thing that we\u2019re seeing again in the U.S. is a nice uptick in both quadrupole and orthogonal time of flight in the pharmaceutical area. So, I would say that as Doug mentioned, we ended up seeing some demand late in the quarter, particularly from China, that wasn\u2019t reflected in sales but is in the order book, and we suffered from a little bit of a tough base of comparison in Europe just given the particular strength that we had during the first half of 2013.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "And I would say Brandon, in terms of underlying symptoms, we\u2019re seeing very strong interest particularly out of academic medical centers for very large programs that anticipate investments in mass spectrometry. I would say in terms of leading indicators, that\u2019s a strong and early dynamic or symptom that we\u2019ve seen recently, so that\u2019s encouraging.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "", "Thanks, that is helpful. And then one for Gene. Could you quantify the impact of currency on the EPS line both in the second quarter and as well as what\u2019s baked into your full-year guidance at this point? And then could you quantify the impact of M&A on the TA segment in 2Q on the revenue line?", "", "Gene Cassis", "", "Yes, if I look at the first half of the \u2013 of this year, we probably had a total effect year-over-year of about $0.10 that we can attribute to currency, and most of that came in the first quarter because we had a more meaningful yen comparison in the first quarter. So we probably had about $0.01 headwind from currency in the second quarter. Looking at the full year, you\u2019re likely to see currency during the remaining -- during the remaining two quarters become a slight headwind, a few cents, fortunately largely offset from a more favorable tax rate this year. So, the negative effect of currency on our EPS is largely offset by the positive on the tax rate. I think for the full year, if I take a look at the effect of M&A, you\u2019re likely to see the major contribution from our TA instruments division. You will recall they acquired four smaller companies last year, and we\u2019re beginning to see the positive impact of those acquisitions in the second quarter, and my estimate is that we might benefit around 50 basis points this year on the topline, primarily from TA acquisitions.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "And the second quarter impact was $2 million to $3 million.", "Gene Cassis", "", "It was a little bit higher. It was a little bit more than half of the TA growth in sales that we can attribute to these acquired companies, but again, if I look at the underlying order dynamics, it\u2019s looking as if about half of the growth that we get from TA this year will be M&A or acquired businesses and the other half organic.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Good morning. So you indicated in your prepared remarks that part of the recovery in the second quarter was driven by recapturing of revenue not captured in Q1, and you seemed to point largely to U.S. pharma, and clearly while you indicated China got better in terms of orders, at the end of the quarter it didn't help you at the revenue line. So it seems like when you are talking about the recapturing, you are talking about U.S. pharma, but when I go back to what you described during the quarter talking about the $20 million Q1 miss, about $15 million of that was attributed to China and $5 million was attributed to TA backlog. And usually when I think of recapturing revenue, I think the incremental margin is going to be a lot better, so I'm just trying to figure out the disconnect here. It does seem like there is a little bit of a disconnect in the explanation, and really importantly as I think about looking ahead, it is definitely great to hear that China is getting better, but it is hard for me to understand exactly what is going on with Waters in the bio-pharma end market. Are things getting better or was there just a recapturing of revenue?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Well, just to -- just to go back and look at the first quarter momentarily right in the $20 million miss, and we had described that as about half of that attributed to slower order growth in China. We had about $5 million associated with the backlog build at TA and another $5 million that we attributed largely to just business shifting in pharma from the first quarter into the second quarter, so it was about a $5 million issue that we were talking about in terms of order slippage and sales slippage. If I take a look at where we are through the first half of this year, the pharmaceutical -- global biopharmaceutical growth is up around 5%, so the strength that we saw in the second quarter of 8% growth in sales does contain some of that business that we might have -- you might think of as first-quarter business. So, going forward, Doug, I would say that a way to think about it is that for the first half, we grew at a nice, mid-single-digit range. We think that that is a logical outlook for the second half of the year.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "", "Okay that is helpful. And then, I guess just a couple cleanups. OpEx increased $10 million relative to Q1, we haven\u2019t seen that since 2011. Most of this was at the SG&A line. I understand some of this was at least FX year-over-year, but I wouldn\u2019t think that would make a huge difference sequentially, so I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle on, are there particular areas where you guys are stepping up investment and is this catch up or is it opportunistic as you see some signs of promise in particular areas?", "Gene Cassis", "", "Well, it had a few components to it Doug. When you look at the business sequentially, you have to realize that we do have married increases that kick in at the first of April. So, you have that and of course that\u2019s in the base quarter last quarter. And you\u2019re right, there is a foreign currency impact that we have, particularly the pound and the euro, both of those hit us in the second quarter and contributed about 2 percentage points of growth on the SG&A line. On top of that and you also have the effect of the acquired businesses at TA, it is not a big effect, but you do have more operating run rate expenses associated with those companies that we acquired last year.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "And the revenue hasn\u2019t really totally kicked in at this point.", "Gene Cassis", "", "Yes. So, those we think are the major components of the SG&A increase.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "", "Okay. And very last one, I don\u2019t think you gave a specific to one decimal point contribution from M&A and FX in the quarter. Would you be willing to break those out?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "FX was 1 point, and M&A was less than 1 point, it was about three quarters of a point.", "Gene Cassis", "", "Yes, it was about 70 basis points from M&A in the quarter, but again it was \u2013 it\u2019s kind of particular to the shipments that we made in the quarter. If I take a look at the underlying impact of the TA acquired businesses, you\u2019re going to be closer to 50 basis points for the year.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Gene Cassis", "", "Welcome.", "Operator: Thank you. Next question is Ross Muken with ISI Group.", "Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group", "Good morning guys. I want to dig in a little bit more again just on sort of China and the rest of Asia, and it seems like developing markets kind of getting better across the portfolio. Usually, that would sort of be feeding off at least as we think to Asia off of China. I guess in terms of the weakness there, particularly on the government end, are we still seeing some of the delays just in terms of budget approvals on high end CapEx, you know say over $50,000 type items where it\u2019s really the sign off process that is just taking time given some of the anti-corruption probe and sort of concerns? And secondarily, when you are seeing some of the order pickup or order improvement, you are feeling more comfortable, is some of that activity that should've happened in the first half that is now getting signed so there is a bit of a catchup or do you think just underlying improvement is kind of happening as just -- there are some releases but demand is also coming back?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Well Ross, you asked a number of questions in there. First of all, the overall Asia business, ex-China, as a matter of fact, the overall developing world definitely saw an uptick in the quarter. Of particular note I would say is India where we\u2019ve been struggling with the political dynamics, the strength of the rupee or the weakness I should. We clearly saw a turn in India, and we\u2019ve continued to see that as we go into the second half. So, I think the symptoms in India are very positive. In China, we think that we\u2019ve seen a clear turnaround in the underlying dynamics of the orders in the revenue cycle. It came in the latter part of the quarter and it particularly turned up in the last few weeks, and needless to say we\u2019re continuing to monitor that, we monitor the China organization, look at the drop sheets. We think we have seen very clear symptoms that the overall tenor of that marketplace has improved. Now, how much we recapture from what maybe could have been a run rate basis in the first half, right now we are not counting on a doubling up of what happens in China. We\u2019re anticipating that this turn that we saw late in the quarter is going to continue to build some momentum as we go through the rest of the year. We clearly see a number of signs that that\u2019s likely to happen. We think the issues that existed is related to a crackdown on corruption kind of was a general dynamic that affected a lot of business in China wasn\u2019t necessarily focused on the lab and analytical marketplace, and to that extent, maybe we have seen it leave that area of the marketplace sooner than some others, but clearly we are more optimistic as we go into the second half.", "Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group", "", "And maybe taking off something Doug said earlier, I mean as we think about the margin line, I mean it seems like the last 12, 18 months have really been characterized a lot by sort of FX movements and sort of a drain, but we have been sort of hovering in this high 20\u2019s area of margin now for a while. I think you hit 29.5 on an annual basis back in \u201811 and that was kind of the peak. I mean as you think about peak margins in this business or the multi-year opportunity and how that translates into kind of your multi-year view on earnings growth, I mean has anything else in the business changed around what you think this model can kind of deliver, and if we stripped out all the noise on FX the last several quarters, anything else of note that you would point out from an incremental perspective that in your mind has kind of changed?", "Gene Cassis", "", "I think that during the time period you\u2019re focusing on, Ross, I think one of the things to bear in mind is that the overall pharmaceutical growth was somewhat less than historical averages typically for Waters Corporation. The pharmaceutical segment has grown at the same rate as the corporation as a whole, and over the past couple of years has been a little bit of a point off the line. We\u2019re kind of encouraged with the trends that we see this year where pharmaceutical seems to be picking up. There is a certain ebb and flow in the business dynamics for that market, and I think that an important component of getting the leverage that we need at the operating profit line is going to be a more sustainable growth trajectory for the pharmaceutical segment.", "Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group", "", "Got it. Thanks Gene.", "Gene Cassis", "", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets.", "Paul Knight \u2013 Janney Capital Markets", "Hi Gene, you had mentioned that the European academic market was down in the second quarter. What was the dynamic last year, a large order flow last year? What do you see in Europe creating that, I think you mentioned down here in 2Q?", "Gene Cassis", "", "I think there was a convergence of positives last year in that the funding, the funding was there and we had a very exciting product in our SYNAPT G2. And so, we were encouraged that that combined to have a very positive effect for us in Europe last year. We\u2019re beginning, as I mentioned before, to see a little bit of an echo of that in the U.S. this year. We believe that the product story is just as compelling and with the funding being better we\u2019re optimistic for the second half of this year.", "Paul Knight \u2013 Janney Capital Markets", "", "And then in China, you had mentioned, you know the corruption issue has been a major deal consolidation of agencies. You seem pretty confident about 2H, is it the orders or anything else you see in China?", "Gene Cassis", "", "Well, you know, if you look at the business in China and think about the non-governmental businesses, the occidental companies that have footprint there as well as the more chemical and food safety business, those businesses have done well all along. So, it\u2019s been the governmentally-funded businesses in particularly around the greater Beijing area where we\u2019ve seen most of the problem. And late in the second quarter, we began to see some orders break through on that front, and I don\u2019t think -- we\u2019re not deep enough into this release process to be able to call a new trajectory on demand, but it\u2019s certainly more encouraging that we began to see some of these bigger ticket items start to flow through into sales.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "We\u2019re also seeing Paul, our customers act a little bit more confident as we go into the second half. So, that\u2019s another point on the line that encourages us.", "Paul Knight \u2013 Janney Capital Markets", "", "And then lastly, the healthcare market here in U.S., is it pharmaceutical better or is it biotech better?", "Gene Cassis", "", " Well, it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s more of the spec pharmaceutical, it\u2019s more of bio. The particular strength that we had in higher-end mass spectrometry in the U.S. is more indicative of the -- more of the biotech business. The large pharmaceutical firms that currently make up something in the range of around 10% of our sales had a rather lackluster year-over-year performance. So, it is more specialty pharmaceutical biotech and generics that are showing strength.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "And clinical too continues to be a pretty robust area particularly in areas of drugs of abuse testing and areas like that.", "Paul Knight \u2013 Janney Capital Markets", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hey thanks. Just to clarify on guidance, you know bringing down the high end of the range by $0.10, is that just simply a catch up from the first quarter miss? I mean, obviously the end markets are improving a bit, you\u2019ve got a lower tax rate, and you have got the restructuring initiatives, are there other factors in there in the back half of the year or is this simply recalibrating from the first quarter?", "Gene Cassis", "", "No, I think when we gave guidance on the first quarter, the high-end of the guidance, anticipated that the issue in China would be resolved, and although we\u2019re encouraged with some of the late quarter trends that we saw, we still had a sales decline in China. So as you begin to think about a recovery and as the year \u2013 what remains in the year gets shorter and shorter, I think it\u2019s only wise to be a little bit more conservative. The other thing is that we\u2019re seeing a little bit more pressure on the currency front, and depending on how product mix materializes for the full year, that could have a little bit of a drag. So, we thought that, that this range that we have right now, maybe has a little bit of conservatism in it. It doesn\u2019t anticipate a full recovery in China, and it does anticipate that we could have a little bit of headwind on the currency front.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "But if you look at the tone of your question Tycho, I do think you \u2013 we are more optimistic than pessimistic about these estimates, I would say.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "I know you had a question on China before, but as we think about -- I mean the tone at ASMS on China was pretty negative, Gene, so can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of the momentum you\u2019re seeing there?", "Gene Cassis", "", "Yes. I think we really can\u2019t talk about that until we have a little bit more clarity on that front, Tycho. I mean we are encouraged that very late in the quarter, and you\u2019re right, post-ASMS we began to see some of these orders break through, but again I think it makes sense to be cautiously optimistic that this is the beginning of more improved business conditions. Fortunately, we are seeing the nice uptick in India offset. We saw it offset some of the China weakness in the second quarter, and frankly the business trajectory in India looks pretty strong, so there could be a little bit of an upside for us during the second half of the year.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "So I think the other thing in China, just another piece of positive data is that we\u2019re talking to a few of the large clinical research centers that we know are favored in terms of the funding initiatives in China. We feel very close to some large commitments from those [tenors] (ph). The timing is a little bit unclear, but we weren\u2019t looking at that as strongly a quarter ago versus today. So, you know, more than a few points on a line that point to positive activity in China.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Okay, and then lastly Gene, can you just comment on the $6 million in restructuring in one-timers, and how should we think about additional restructuring initiatives going forward?", "Gene Cassis", "", "I don\u2019t think you should think about additional restructuring. There is nothing in the second half of this year that I see.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Thank you.", "Gene Cassis", "", "It was a first quarter dynamic, yeah, welcome.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Next question, Jon Groberg of Macquarie.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "Thanks, good morning. Hey Doug, from the tone around the CEO search, it sounds like this may take a little bit longer than you initially anticipated. I think oftentimes we think these things are going to go quicker. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color around kind of what you are seeing there and maybe why you think it could take a little longer?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "I\u2019m not sure. From my perspective, it\u2019s going about as I expected Jon. The process just -- you\u2019ve got Directors involved, it\u2019s not a one man initiative. So, you know, you\u2019ve got to go through the process of identifying all the players and vet them and then reference check them. That is mainly the reason why I provided such a long window of transition, so I think we are right where I expected. We have had some good strong interviews with very viable candidates, but it is just the process grinds it down finer and finer, so I fully anticipate that within the window I\u2019ve described, we will have a very good candidate. We\u2019re continuing to vet both internal and external candidates, but it\u2019s going to still take some time. I think I wouldn\u2019t want or lead you to believe that we\u2019ll have an announcement anytime in the next few months.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Doug, also if you look at your balance sheet, I mean your net cash continues to build again. I know that you noted you are going to make a technology acquisition. I guess the question is are you -- you mentioned you are still committed to the buyback, but obviously you have given your cash outside the U.S. I mean it continues to build up. So I guess, I'm just trying to think about is there any shift in terms of what you want to do with that cash, and is this technology acquisition large enough that is it dilutive, is it contemplated in your guidance? I'm just trying to understand, I guess, your, kind of, cash, if there is any shift there around your cash [view] (ph)?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Frankly, Jon there is no shift around our view. We continue to believe that it\u2019s unlikely that we will do anything in substantive terms that increases the risk quotient in our business. We continue to believe that long-term we\u2019ve got excellent opportunities to continue to grow the business at an organic rate that\u2019s in the high-single digits. It\u2019s going to continue to produce outstanding free cash flow, and certainly if there is anything near the current price of our stock, we think it\u2019s a good deal. So, we\u2019ll continue to focus on the buybacks. The technology deal that we\u2019re going to talk about with the press release is fully anticipated in our forecast for earnings and sales. It\u2019s not going to impact our sales in the short-term, but it is a very highly anticipated technology transaction largely focused in the mass spec and long-term in the clinical arena. So, we continue to think long-term. We are not looking at acquiring businesses, cost reducing, and leveraging the short-term. I think we\u2019ll continue to do what we\u2019ve done for years, and I think in the long run, you wake up, we\u2019ll have fewer shares outstanding and we\u2019ll be leveraging the bottom line in a way we have historically.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "", "And a lot of your customers are looking at \u2013 on the pharma side are doing inversions to be able to have more access to their cash, it sounds like that\u2019s not something you are contemplating?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "It\u2019s highly unlikely, I would say. We certainly wouldn\u2019t be interested in doing it from a tax rate perspective, obviously inversions give you some additional ability to use your cash outside the U.S., but I would say that\u2019s an unlikely scenario for us.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie", "", "Okay thanks.", "Operator", "", "Dan Leonard with Leerink.", "Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink", "Great, thank you. I could use some more color on how important the new mass spec launches are to your second-half outlook. I think Doug, you mentioned meaningful shipments are anticipated, but is there any way you can further quantify?", "Gene Cassis", "", "It\u2019s interesting that the two benchtop instruments that we have I think fit into a sweet spot within the mass spectrometry market. They are directed nicely at regulated testing. Clearly, I think they will represent significant shipment volume. It is not likely that there will be heavy cannibalization of our high-end TQ-S system. So, as we looked across our product line and thought about the sequence of introductions that we\u2019ve had over the past few years, we clearly recognize that some of these value priced, value performance segment of the market probably required a new product introduction, and we feel confident that from initial customer reception of these devices that we\u2019re going to be in a nice position there. In addition, Doug had alluded to the ionKey technology as being an important innovation in mass spectrometry, and I think it\u2019s the combination of ionKey technology and these new benchtop devices along with the TQ-S also makes a very interesting opportunity for us.", "Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink", "", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful color. And for my follow-up Doug, could you elaborate on a comment you made in response to Brandon\u2019s question earlier. You mentioned there are some very large programs that academic medical centers that anticipate mass spec investments. Could you talk a bit more about that, what are the applications and what specifically is happening on the field?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Yes, I would say without mentioning specific names, we are looking at more large research programs in the academic medical center area than we probably ever have, and I would say they are closer to fruition than many of these discussions typically are. I would say they -- you\u2019ve all been exposed to the dramatic increase in investment in genomics that\u2019s going on. I think you\u2019re beginning to see a similar type of focus on phenomics or whether it\u2019s down to proteomics or metabolomics of looking what\u2019s going on in specific phenome centers that are taking on kind of comparable levels of anticipated investment. Well, we have certainly done some of that with Imperial College in London and building on that relationship, we\u2019re seeing a great deal of interest apparent in other centers around the globe, you know not limited to the United States. Limited -- also showing up in Asia and in \u2013 and interestingly in areas of the Middle East also. So, I\u2019m very encouraged by it -- this investment that we are going to announce this afternoon further complements our activity in that area, so we\u2019re building a portfolio that I think is going to be pretty impressive to answer the needs in these emerging research areas.", "Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "The next question is Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks for taking the question. Just one on the guidance here. It does assume in your guidance I think for an acceleration in the organic growth rate in the second half as we just kind of look at the first half versus the full-year assumptions. And the reason I'm asking the question is the comps that you have are considerably tougher in the fourth quarter versus third quarter on a year-over-year basis for organic growth. So, I just want to get a sense of what kind of organic growth assumptions are contemplated in your third quarter guidance?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Yes. Gene can flesh it out, but I think if you look at our all-in first half growth rate, we\u2019re looking at roughly the same anticipated growth rate in the second half. We certainly had a very low growth rate in the first quarter, and that kicked up to high-single -- mid-single digits, I would say, in the second quarter. We anticipate our growth rate to be higher in the third quarter than it will be in the fourth quarter largely for the dynamics you cited, Isaac, that the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter last year. It\u2019s not impossible to have another very strong quarter, but the reality is when you\u2019ve got a tough compare, it\u2019s probably wiser to anticipate leavening of that. So, I don\u2019t think the second half is anticipated in our guidance to be much different than what we have seen in the first half, and to be fair I mean, I would say we\u2019re probably [err] (ph), the reality could be a little bit better than that. I think right now we\u2019re running a little bit stronger than that, but we\u2019re careful given the fact that China doesn\u2019t have that many points on the line, and it\u2019s still an important part of our worldwide revenue.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Got it. And maybe just a follow-up, product specific question. Curious if you can comment on the market for medical cannabis testing. That is an area where we\u2019ve seen what looks to be pretty interesting uptick in demand for your products, so I would be curious what the contribution was either it\u2019s whether this quarter or year-to-date, just the current impact and outlook for that business specifically?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Yes. It is an area that we are optimistic about. We think that it\u2019s reasonable to provide the products particularly to help in the overall characterization and quality control of that marketplace. Of course, it\u2019s now limited to a small handful of geographies around the United States. In the quarter, it wasn\u2019t a material number, certainly not a point, much less than a point of revenue for us, but we think it has the opportunity to grow into an eight figured revenue number. This year, it could press that, so that means the second half would be stronger than the first half. We certainly are responding to a level of requests, particularly in the extraction area of our business, where we have a pretty strong position with supercritical fluid. So, I would say, I think the second half is going to be stronger than the first half, and I think it\u2019s going to be a multi-year opportunity for us, but it will probably be a few quarters before we\u2019ll talk about it being, you know a $4 million or $5 million business.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Got it. Okay, thank you so much.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the Amanda Murphy with William Blair.", "Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair", "Hi, good morning. Just a question on competition. I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing on (inaudible) sides of the business around competitive dynamics, particularly in China?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "I would say the competitive dynamics in China across the product lines haven\u2019t changed very much. We haven\u2019t seen -- we\u2019ve seen a few of our customers, our competitors show up in the news because of transgressions, but I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve seen that have a dramatic effect on the competitive issues, so I\u2019d say it is kind of no news both on the mass spec front and on the chromatography front in China. It\u2019s almost totally a customer dynamic that we are willing to talk about China. And the rest of world, I would say chromatography is a remarkably consistent competitive arena, don\u2019t see too many ripples on that wave front. On the mass spec front, you see some ebbs and flows from quarter-to-quarter. We probably ebbed a little in the early part of this year. We think we are beginning to flow more as ASMS comes behind us, and we see a number of these very large initiatives beginning to pay fruit, so that\u2019s probably what I\u2019m seeing on the competitive front.", "Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair", "", "And just on the columns, you\u2019ve talked a little bit about attach rates in the past between HPLC and UPLC, are those still basically the same? And is there -- are you seeing any \u2013 especially on the UPLC side, just given that you have a higher attach rate, is there a potential for that to maybe change going forward?", "Gene Cassis", "", "Well I think the biggest dynamic on that front, Amanda, in the long run, I could see the migration of UPLC into quality control methods, and that\u2019s a multi-year process, because the usage of columns is so much higher when you\u2019re running a regulated method like that. But we\u2019re very excited about the trajectory for our new line of CORTECS columns. It seems to have a significant performance advantage, and it complements the other column chemistries that we offer on the UPLC and HPLC front.", "Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair", "", "Got it. And then just on the, I guess a product specific question as well on the QDA, I think you\u2019ve talked about that being adding about a percent of growth, is that still what you\u2019re looking for?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Yes the \u2013 what we, the results that we have for the first half of the year are consistent with that vision.", "Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo.", "Tim Evans \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hi thanks. Gene, I\u2019m a little confused on the comments about the contribution from your recent acquisitions, I think in response to Brandon\u2019s question, you indicated that there was about $5 million of revenue there, and then later on you said it was more like 70 bps in the quarter. $5 million looks to me like it would be over a point of growth in the quarter and assuming that you get more revenue in the back-half of the year from these acquisitions, which I think has been your forecast, you would be looking at more than a point of growth for the full year from these acquisitions. And so, I\u2019m just trying to understand what the right number is on that and how that relates to your mid-single-digit revenue growth guidance?", "Gene Cassis", "", "Yes, Tim, I know that the number of $5 million was in an answer to a question and I know that 70 bps was an answer to a question. But I don\u2019t think the two of them are together, because you\u2019re right that\u2019s inconsistent. And that the TA instruments business is roughly 12% of the corporation sales. So understanding that we\u2019re anticipating a mid-to-high single-digit growth rate for that division this year and on top of that understanding that we\u2019re anticipating that half of it is organic and half of it is acquired business. I think you can do the numbers and certainly it doesn\u2019t equate to a $5 million per quarter.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "But simply put the acquisition revenue in the second quarter was something around $2 million, $2.5 million. So the effect of acquired revenue was less than a half, it is mostly half a point probably a little bit less. It\u2019s now that that\u2019s going to ramp up in the second half, we fully believe.", "Tim Evans \u2013 Wells Fargo", "", "Okay, so when we think about your full year organic growth what should we be thinking about?", "Gene Cassis", "", "Yes, mid-single-digit and assume about 50 basis points worth of contribution from M&A.", "Tim Evans \u2013 Wells Fargo", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Baird.", "Jeff Elliott \u2013 Baird", "Good morning, thanks for the question. First question is on Japan, little bit softer the second quarter, how should we think about growth in the second half?", "Gene Cassis", "", "I think we should think about it as maybe a little bit less robust than what we delivered for the first half, through the first half the constant currency growth rate was about 8%, I would say in the second half we are encouraged by what we see as improved business dynamics in the four profit sectors of that market. And understanding that in terms of government supported research we have a kind of the tough base of comparison given the performance that we had for that segment in the prior year. So, overall we\u2019re probably expecting Japan to be maybe close to mid-single-digit, maybe a little bit less than mid-single-digit. But certainly positive growth with the growth being driven from the industrial chemical and pharmaceutical segments of that market.", "Jeff Elliott \u2013 Baird", "", "And Gene two quick modeling questions, first on Easter in the quarter did you see any impact there, particularly in the columns business?

Competitively, I think I touched on it in the previous question, and some of our competitors have run into minor or not so minor legal issues. So that had to deal with some of those, we have of course not gone with, did not run into similar kinds of issues. But on balance I don\u2019t think the competitive dynamics in the LC area have changed very much that we are all still there and it\u2019s competitive. I think some of our competitors tend to use price more aggressively, but we haven\u2019t seen that affect our business to any great extent.

We didn\u2019t see that the customer was all of a sudden looking at four competitors, because they didn\u2019t like our product that kind of thing was all is internal dynamic and that\u2019s what we saw begin to loosen up as we worked our way through the quarter. To be fair our organization anticipated, they are in the ground they are talking to customers, they are talking to the government officials, and they saw internally and forecast that the process would begin to loosen up and in fact it did and those orders begin to flow late in the quarter.

We do built throughout our business in the quarter, but that one in China was the one that was related to this whole process of government intervention.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities ", "But I\u2019m just\u2026", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "I think since we\u2019re well over an hour here, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "", "Our final question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America", "Hi, good morning. Just one quick one, I just sort of want to clarify and just make sure I understand, and this is sort of related to what Isaac was asking about the comps in the back-half of the year about 10% organic revenue comp in Q4 and that include some contributions from the QDA launch already. And so just if I\u2019m sort of sifting through the commentary in the Q&A, is part of that is that your confidence since you\u2019re getting and being able to beat that number or deliver on the organic revenue growth is that large multisystem orders is that what I saw here you\u2019re hitting that or it is just sort of steady growth and improvement in the overall market in the year end? Basically, are you expecting some large multisystem orders in mass spec in Q4?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "Those, we may get some large orders Derik in the second half of the year. However, those are not baked into the expectations that are included in our guidance. I would say that, you\u2019re absolutely correct that the, from a growth point of view it is a 10% growth quarter in debate. But there is another way to look at the base year and understand that on a percentage base the fourth quarter last year represented about 30% of the annual sales. In that regard it is not that atypical when you look at the natural quarterization of our business where typically the first quarter is 20% to 22%, the two middle quarters are around 25% and the fourth quarter is typically in the 28% to 30%. So it is a little bit on the high side, but when you look at the quarter, when you look at the base of comparison using percent of business across the quarters, it doesn\u2019t look quite as steep as it might when you just look at growth rates, which in terms have a dependants on what the 2012 year look like.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America", "Great.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "", "That\u2019s largely because of that strong base that you will see as you derive with our anticipated growth rates, we\u2019ve taken our anticipated growth rate in the fourth quarter down to the lower single-digit. So, we clearly expect the growth to be stronger in the third quarter tempered because, of the strong base in the fourth quarter. And we think that\u2019s very reasonable.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America", "Great, okay that\u2019s actually what I was heading for. Great, thanks a lot, I appreciate it.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Welcome.", "Gene Cassis", "Welcome.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, thank you all for sticking with us through this extended timeframe.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter 2014 financial results conference call. With me on today\u2019s call is Gene Cassis, the Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "And as is our normal practice, I\u2019ll start with an overview of the quarter\u2019s business, and then Gene will follow with details of our financial results and then update you with our outlook for the fourth quarter. But before we get going, I\u2019d like Gene to cover the cautionary language.", "Gene Cassis", "Thank you, Doug.

We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for January 2015.", "During this call, we\u2019ll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly compatible GAAP measures is attached with the Company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results and operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which include the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials also included in this morning\u2019s press release. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thanks, Gene. Well, I am pleased to tell you that our third quarter results exceeded our expectations. Continued strong demand from our global pharmaceutical customers contributed to faster sales growth rates in most regions of the world. Margins in the quarter benefited from higher sales volume and favorable product mix dynamics. In all operating leverage in the quarter in combination with steady share repurchases, resulted in mid teens adjusted EPS growth.", "When you look at the third quarter, our constant currency sales were up 8% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 16%. That's clearly an improvement over the strong results we delivered in the second quarter. For the Waters Division, organic sales growth was 9% and benefited from stronger shipment volume to pharmaceutical end markets.", "Overall sales were broadly defined pharmaceutical segment were up 12% in the quarter and 7% through the first nine months of 2014. Global government and academic business also picked up nicely in the quarter with growth in the U.S and Europe leading the way.", "We anticipate the government funded instrument sales in the U.S and Europe will remain strong in the fourth quarter and see some opportunity for improved demand from government and academic labs and our larger Asian markets, especially for our more advanced mass spectrometry based instruments.", "Our Waters Division industrial chemical and chemical analysis businesses declined at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, due primarily to weaker demand in Asia and weaker cyclical demand for food safety applications.", "Coming into the quarter, we remain focused on monitoring business conditions in China. Earlier in the year, delays in placing orders at governmentally funded institutions, contributed to overall declines in China sales. In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of this business trend and finished the quarter with a mid single-digit decline in sales, although a modest increase in orders. Though customer interest continues to be strong, we do not expect to see a dramatic change in the fourth quarter and will incorporate a conservative short-term outlook in our guidance.", "Sales growth in the U.S was encouraging in the third quarter. For the Waters Division, sales were up 9%, the same growth rate as we delivered in the second quarter. Growth was strongest in our pharmaceutical and governmentally funded segments and elsewhere in the Americas business trends continued to be very positive across most customer segments.", "Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan increased slightly in the quarter, with strong growth in pharmaceutical and solid growth in industrial chemical accounts somewhat tempered by declines in public sector spending, and that's a trend that we saw also in the second quarter.", "In India, we saw a continuation of healthy double-digit sales growth as generic drug firms resumed adding new instruments and replacing old ones. In addition, our service business in India benefited from strong demand for validation services as drug firms there are actively taking steps to ensure regulatory compliance.", "Our European Waters Division sales at constant currency were up 9% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid single-digits while our government and academic business accelerated and grew with a strong double-digit rate.", "Looking at our TA Instruments Division, global sales were up 3% in the quarter. The slower sales growth can be explained by a strong mid-teens growth this division delivered in the prior year\u2019s quarter making the comparisons difficult. Geographically sales in Europe and Japan was stronger this quarter, while more challenging business conditions in China and in smaller developing countries slowed TA\u2019s overall growth. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect constant currency growth at a stronger mid single-digit rate for TA.", "Now, I'll talk some of our Waters Division product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew 9% in the third quarter. Waters\u2019 service business was generally strong across all major regions and the trend towards higher penetration for service contracts was apparent in the quarter\u2019s results.", "On the chemistry front, our Column business benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. Our new line of CORTECS columns has been very well received and we've recently expanded our high-performance column offerings for biotherapeutics.", "Waters Division instrument systems sales grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter. Demand improved across most regions and especially for pharmaceutical applications, and for governmentally funded and academic labs. Overall, demand for research-focused UPLC MS systems was up double digits and particularly for proteomics and phenomics applications. Our new UPLC QTof system, the Xevo G2-XS introduced earlier this year at ASMS has been very well received across a wide range of lifescience applications.", "On the tandem quadrupole front, we\u2019ve just began shipping our recently introduced Xevo TQ-S micro late in the third quarter. This new instrument delivers a unique combination of performance in value and a compact benchtop design and shipments in the fourth quarter expected to contribute nicely to our overall instrument systems growth.", "In addition, third quarter sales of our highest performance tandem quadrupole system, the Xevo TQ-S, significantly benefited from our new ionKey source technology. As you may recall, this technology integrates high-performance tile-based UPLC separations technology with our StepWave ion source to effect dramatic improvements in analytical sensitivity. Sales for this technology have been particularly strong at select international drug firms for early to mid stage drug development applications, and we believe that successes at these accounts will drive wider adoption.", "Speaking about mass spec technology, I'm pleased to tell you that we acquired the assets of MediMass in July. This acquisition provides us with an ion source technology called Rapid Evaporation Ionization Mass Spectrometry or REIMS for short. Though this new technology has value across a wide array of research applications and is complimentary to other atmospheric pressure ionization techniques that we offer, we are very excited about the longer-term benefits of REIMS to our recently announced health science initiative. This initiative which we formally organized earlier this year recognizes an important transition in medical research that demands a suite of usable advanced technologies, including research grade mass spectrometry to attain a more comprehensive understanding of disease.", "This molecular based understanding will result in more effective predictive diagnostic and therapeutic dose to cost-effectively manage human health. For example, leading oncology researchers in North America, Europe, and Asia are envisioning technologies such as REIMS not only for research and diagnostic workflows, but also for surgical procedures wherein careful extraction of cancerous tissue can be more effectively accomplished with a specialized REIMS probe integrated with a surgeon\u2019s scalpel. This [ph] [ionized] concept currently underdevelopment, exemplifies the long-term potential for innovations in mass spectrometry in improving medical outcomes.", "More broadly, our health science initiative is recasting Waters as a key player in next-generation medical research. Working with leading researchers across the globe, we\u2019re developing new workflows to more effectively cross reference proteomic, metabolomic and phenomic data to better predict characterize and diagnose disease. Going forward, we believe we established a strong basis and differentiated position to achieve market leadership and a rapidly growing and profitable business opportunity.", "Return now to the recent quarter, on the chromatography front, all major system offerings performed well in the quarter. ACQUITY instrument system sales benefited from yet another strong quarter for ACQUITY QDa mass detector shipments. And the primary application area for this new detection technology is in the area of small molecule drug research, and in the third quarter, we saw drug research customers purchase the QDa as a detection module for existing UPLC or HPLC systems as well as within new system orders. The sales ramp up of the ACQUITY QDa is on track to generate about $20 million in sales in its first calendar year on the market.", "Now I\u2019d like to briefly discuss the outlook for the fourth quarter. Against a strong prior year comparison, we expect constant currency sales growth in the mid single-digit range. This level of growth will allow the Company to finish the year with a top line performance that's consistent with our original guidance, which as you may recall did not anticipate slower growth in China.", "For the Waters Division, we believe that the strength of pharmaceutical demand that we\u2019ve witnessed for the past two quarters is sustainable and that our recurring revenue will continue to deliver predictable growth through the fourth quarter. We are also encouraged by the success of our new product launches, including the ACQUITY QDa, and our new Xevo mass spectrometry platforms. In addition, there are near-term and significant opportunities associated with the health science initiative that I discussed earlier.", "On the M&A front and for the Waters Division, we continue to see opportunities to benefit our long-term initiatives in applications such as food safety testing, microbiology, and clinical diagnostics by licensing and acquiring innovative technologies. For our TA Division, we will likely continue a consistent and focused business acquisition plan. However, given our primary focus on driving organic growth, we plan to continue to deploy the lion\u2019s share of our strong cash generation on our share repurchase program.", "Finally on the leadership transition front, we continue to actively progress in the search for my successor. Our primary focus is to ensure a smooth transition and I look forward to sharing information on developments on this topic, probably during the next few earnings calls.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Gene for a review of our financials and an update on our outlook.", "Gene Cassis", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning all. In the third quarter, our sales came in at $493 million, an increase of 8% over last year\u2019s with currency translation neutral to sales. On a non-GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were up 16% to $1.38. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $1.34 versus $1.14 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release that we issued this morning.", "Looking at our growth geographically and before foreign currency exchange effects, U.S. sales were up 8%, Europe was up 9%, Japan was up 4%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 5%. Strong sales growth in India helped offset a 5% decline in China. Rest of World sales notably including Latin America were up 15%.", "On the product front, and again in constant currency terms and within the Waters Division, instrument system sales increased by 8% and our recurring revenues grew by 9%. In all of the Waters Division, sales were up 9%. For our TA instruments Division, constant currency sales including instruments and services increased 3% again off of a tough base of comparison.", "Now, I\u2019d like to comment on our third quarter\u2019s non-GAAP financial performance versus the third quarter of the prior year. Gross margins came in at 59% versus 58.1% in the third quarter last year as mix dynamics and continued manufacturing productivity gains offset some currency headwinds.", "SG&A expenses were up about 3% on a constant currency basis with the impact of currency translation being about neutral. R&D expenses increased by 13% before foreign currency translation, and a stronger British pound, in particular, added another 3%.", "On the tax front, we now expect our full-year operating tax rate to be around 14%. Applying this tax rate to our cumulative earnings, pushes our effective operating tax rate for the third quarter to 13.1%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $7 million and share account came in at 84.4 million shares or approximately 2 million shares lower than in our third quarter last year, a net result of our share repurchase programs.", "Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.95 billion, and debt totaled $1.4 billion bringing us to a net cash position of $516 million. As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 735,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $76 million. In all, we have approximately $843 million in repurchases remaining on previously authorized programs.", "We define cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the third quarter, free cash flow came in at $106 million after funding $17 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is $2 million of investments associated with facility expansion.", "Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 73 days this quarter, down 1 day from the third quarter of last year. In the quarter, inventories decreased by $4 million in comparison to the second quarter so sequentially.", "As we think about our expectations, for the fourth quarter of 2014, and considering the strong quarterly comparison, we anticipate constant currency sales growth to moderate from the third quarter\u2019s rate and come in at the 4% to 5% range. Currency translation at today's rate would reduce sales by about 2%.", "Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the fourth quarter are expected to sequentially improve from the third quarter of 2014. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled. Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $8 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at about 14%.", "Rolling all these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within the range of $1.83 to $1.93 in the fourth quarter. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first nine months of this year, we anticipate full-year 2014 constant currency sales growth of about 5% and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. These results assume the following: a modest full-year currency translation headwind to sales of less than 1%, a negative currency impact of full-year EPS of about 3%, a full-year operating tax rate of around 14%, and finally a full-year share count of about 85 -- an average share count of 85 million shares outstanding.", "That\u2019s it from me. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, Gene. Carolyn, I think we can now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ross Muken from ISI Group. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC", "Good morning and congrats guys.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Good morning, Ross.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC", "So maybe let\u2019s start on the pharma side, this was obviously a really strong print and the year-to-date numbers are obviously quite good as well. As we think about through the components terms of the pharma sub sector is [ph] [zero], biotech pharma, small pharma et cetera, where are you seeing the biggest upside surprise and to what do you sort of attitude, I guess, that magnitude change as we have kind of progressed through the year, which it seems like it\u2019s kind of gotten better?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Yes, Ross it has gotten a little bit better. I think it\u2019s fair to say. I'd say clearly this quarter India's return in the generic drug marketplace has certainly been strong. So that's a segment that we certainly saw here. Our biggest pharmaceutical accounts are up mid single-digit to little bit better. So that\u2019s an encouraging outcome for big pharma who are of course relying on specialty pharma more. Biotech and specialty would probably in the mid line area of our market, the strongest performers over and above the large integrated traditional pharma accounts. So generics and then specialty and bio and then big pharma as we\u2019d characterize it probably in that order.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC", "Thanks. And then, maybe just turning to China, which has obviously been a huge focus and I think disappointing for many other than yourself. I mean, as you look at that market, what are you keyed in on -- in any of the end markets in terms of giving you any signs of hope maybe of a stabilization or improvement or where would you expect to see I guess the inflection first that may give you a better signal that at least some parts of that market may heal and improve versus other parts that are probably more structurally challenged going forward?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, in our business the piece that\u2019s most challenged is the one that's directly government funded and supported. The piece of the China business that's expat, the large integrated companies is doing just fine. So it's clearly a government dynamic that's affecting China. And it\u2019s pretty broad; it's not like a segment that is happening in research pharmaceuticals versus food safety or versus environmental. I'd say they're all being affected and I don't think one is being disproportionately singled out where it's a cut back in healthcare spending or I think it\u2019s just this general concern that is capsulized in this crack down on corruption that I think its generally resulted in almost everybody in the approval chain taking longer to make sure all i\u2019s are dotted, t\u2019s are crossed and even when they\u2019re they go back for a second and third check. So I think the encouraging thing is that our orders rate grew in the quarter. We are certainly still seeing the underlying demand there and it\u2019s hard to believe that this whole condition can stay in the current condition too much longer. And as we said, we\u2019re not anticipating a rapid turnaround in the fourth quarter, but I wouldn't be surprised to see some let up come soon.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC", "Great. Thanks, Doug for the commentary.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Leerink. Your line is open.", "Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann & Company", "Thank you. As you think about your forecast for 2014 in China is coming in weaker, what is the primary offset that offsets that versus your view which enables you to make up for the weakness in China?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I\u2019d say generally in terms of trade classes its pharma that has continued to be a little bit stronger. We were probably always more optimistic than the analyst community, but it's probably even a few points stronger than that. I also think this broadly define healthcare initiative that we\u2019ve talked about paying real premiums in a -- as the world continues to invest in genomics technology clearly, but also recognizing that proteomics, metabolomics, phenomics is going to be an important part of delivering meaningful diagnostics in therapeutics. They\u2019re really ramping up the investment in mass spectrometry, particularly in the large-scale academic medical centers where we\u2019ve had, boy, a huge amount of interest, significant order rate, and a drop sheet or interest level that\u2019s very significant. So I think that piece of the healthcare marketplace is very strong and you see that reflected in our results and in our expectations going forward.", "Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann & Company", "That's helpful. Thanks. And for my follow-up, Doug, you made some comments in your prepared remarks about a cyclical downturn or cyclical weakness in the food safety market. I was just hoping you could elaborate. Is that wrapped up in the China phenomenon as well, or is there something different going on there?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "It's definitely significantly affected by China, and that we see in our orders in the quarter. But we\u2019ve seen that food safety can be lumpy. If you look at it for the year, we clearly have a good year in the broadly described food market, but quarterly, you can find that Thailand booked $2 million order last year and won\u2019t book again for another year or something like that. So we find these lumps of business, some of which we anticipate and some of which kind of slip from one quarter to another Dan. So, but calling it cyclical is probably a broad term that -- probably fair to call it more lumpy quarter-to-quarter.", "Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann & Company", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one is on the healthcare and the clinical end market, which I think you just talked about, Doug, and it did come up in the prepared remarks. This is something we\u2019re hearing a lot more about from Waters. It\u2019s not apparent that there is a lot of incremental investment at the R&D line or SG&A line related to that focus, although I\u2019m sure there is some embedded in the numbers. I\u2019m just curious, can growth in this end market occur at a meaningful and sustained rate without a whole lot of incremental investment in product development and/or channel? Just trying to think about how we model this really promising growth opportunity not just at the top line, but also at the operating line and, I guess, while we are on this topic, could you just provide an update on what percentage of sales this accounts for right now?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure, Doug. I think in terms of the strategic approach to this market, you're seeing two things. One of which is something that we\u2019ve traditionally done and you\u2019ve seen us do for 25 years is we reallocate the resources at both the R&D level and at the marketing level to focus, we can move it as we think we\u2019ve matured in one area and we can move resources into this clinical initiative. You can see from our growth in R&D, we have begun to increase R&D somewhat, but that's always been a hallmark of ours that we can redirect and then squeeze more out of our R&D spending than you might otherwise suspect. The other thing, you\u2019ve heard of me talk about the acquisition of MediMass and the REIMS technology and the iKnife. So we\u2019ve not dipped our toes dramatically into the acquisition for product or for acquisition sake. That\u2019s something that others are pretty good at and we kind of focus our acquisition on technology or specific missing elements of our product portfolio. So we\u2019ve done it with REIMS and MediMass, we did it with the TransOmics acquisition about 14 months ago. And we do it with partnerships, particularly with thought leaders in academia or in academic medical centers. That's been a particularly rich source with cancer centers here in the United States, with thought leaders in China, some of the biggest thought leaders in the world there, and in Europe. So, we\u2019ve had very close relationships in those institutions and we can therefore leverage their brains and their willingness to work as partners in development of many of these technologies. So, yes, we might find ourselves on the margin having to allocate more resources, but we think we can do it within our P&L models without dramatically affecting our results.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, I guess, my second question is on the succession plans. When you initially announced the plan to find a successor, you were clear in providing a window of about two years. So, there is still a decent amount of time left in that window and you've been clear it possibly could stretch. That said, I think it is fair to assert that many are surprised this is taking as long as it has, especially when you said in your prepared remarks you expect to have an update over the next few quarters. Could you just provide a bit more clarity on how this process is proceeding? And then, I guess secondly, I would think the longer this goes on the greater the risk that organizational uncertainty could become more of an operational concern. Do you agree? And if so, how are you managing this? Thank you.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Okay. I think it\u2019s a very fair question and I\u2019m sure, you are probably the only one interested in this question Doug, but I\u2019ll focus on it. The process is one where the Board of Directors is assigned a subcommittee of the Board who is principally responsible for the process. I participated with that committee as well as three other members of the Board including our lead Director. We have hired executive recruiters, and we have been proceeding through that kind of normal phase of going through phase one with candidates, getting names, betting their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, having initial interviews, then having second interviews. I would say that the process is not particularly troublesome from our perspective. Yes, we\u2019ve had some candidates that we thought were going to be very good and might have proceeded very quickly, and then either they dropped out of the process for their own internal reasons or towards the end of a process we got cold feet and have moved on. I\u2019d say, the process is kind of either on or off, and until we\u2019re ready to announce a transition either internal and as the process goes along the opportunity for an internal candidate to step up becomes somewhat higher in probability or an external candidate. And you know every day as these mergers happen in our space and people don\u2019t want to work for a bigger company, the population of potential becomes richer. And so we\u2019re examining new candidates on that front kind of people who have more proven r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and so I think the committee is very comfortable with the state of the process, with the richness of the shortlist that we\u2019re working. We\u2019re interviewing candidates on a weakly basis. But to some extent, I have always been comfortable with this window. I have always thought that it was going to take longer probably rather than shorter. As you can see it doesn\u2019t seem to be hurting our results and we\u2019re -- the organization listens to that story, is comfortable with it. And I think the evidence is that it continues to deliver excellent results across the Board. So, yes, maybe as the process winds along, you worry about continued performance, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sign that, that performance is eroding. It\u2019s quite the opposite. The performance is improving. And there\u2019s no indication that we will be bereft senior leadership as this process goes along. We\u2019ll continue to run it the way we\u2019ve run it for 20 plus years and sooner or later we\u2019ll have a good quality successor in place and we\u2019re not uncomfortable with the particular level of uncertainty that exists today.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "All right, thanks Doug. That\u2019s really helpful and congrats on the quarter.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Good morning. Thanks Doug. A question for you just on long-term product design. You guys had it done in franchise for many years. As you pointed out the results continue to be strong. What is your philosophy around where the HPLC market is going from here and specifically what can you do to add value both in your pharmaceutical customers and in the research markets? We\u2019ve had UPLC as a great technology for a while. What do you think -- how do you think about adding value from here forward?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Isaac, I think, maybe unlike some others in the industry we always believe that this is a very dynamic technology. Others thought 15, 20 years ago that you had to focus on cost reduction and the cost of ownership that the technology couldn\u2019t deliver more bank for the buck in terms of speed, sensitivity or resolution. I think the most clear example that that was wrongheaded was ACQUITY and UPLC that brought substantial new benefits to the user of chromatography. You look at our introduction of ionKey technology, the separation device particularly for use in the mass spec arena and early on the drug company users are astonished by the kind of user friendliness and benefits in terms of chromatographic results that result from that. I think you\u2019ll continue to see benefits in that kind of technology, as well as just improved speed, improved separation products. One of the benefits that Waters brings here is our substantial capabilities in separations technology in the column technology. And that\u2019s resulted in these things like ionKey and being able to configure chemistry in more novel delivery packages that prove useful for the consumer. You look at UPC2 technology, the use of supercritical fluids for bringing an additional tool to the benchtop and to be fair, we thought the UPLC2 was going to earlier on play a more dominant role, but I\u2019ll tell you this past quarters UPC2 grow at a substantial rate, and we think that the future for UPC2 in any number of applications is going to significantly improve the toolkit for analytical chemists and will contribute to our growth rate substantially. And I haven\u2019t even talked about data and the ability of novel new software and application protocols to bring the kind of benefit particularly in this healthcare initiative as we look at diagnostics and the research market place. So, no one has invested the kind of resources that we have in providing novel both chromatography and mass spec analysis capabilities into the healthcare marketplace and you\u2019ll see that continue to push the market place forward. I\u2019m sure if I\u2019ve forgotten two or three important things that we\u2019re also working on, principally in the hardware and the core pumping, injecting, detecting arena. So, I mean, I\u2019m very excited about it and I think you can tell that we think we\u2019re still perched on a future that\u2019s very strong growth because of all these initiatives.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "It\u2019s very helpful, Doug. Just as a follow-up to that, the reason I asked the question is, obviously with the transition in management coming up there is I think some curiosity about long-term innovation in the business. So, if we total up all the things that you talked about between ionKey and UPC2 and software and diagnostics, I mean, if we look three and five years down the road, do you think those initiatives will combine to be let's say more than 20% of your business? Or just trying to think about where it\u2019s going over the long-term? Are these initiatives together going to be critical mass such that you have a whole new leg to the business or at least a new complexion to the total exposure of your product line?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well I think what you\u2019re going to see is this melding of pharmaceutical and clinical care. Right now kind of the pharmaceutical business is to take care of drug development kind of and then hand it over to clinical care specialists and that kind of discreet markets more and more the combination of genetics and phenomics in drug discovery and drug development and clinical care are merging together. And I think the combination of those things is something that works in our favor because we are important players in certainly all elements of that in particularly a growing presence with our healthcare initiative. So, I think it will be a little bit tough to discern how much is kind of in a more traditional Waters modality and how much is kind of new work with cancer centers and diagnostic initiatives. But clearly we think a disproportionate amount of growth over the next five years is going to come out of these new partnerships and clinical care initiatives that result from phenomics and treatment modalities that are going to emerge.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "All right. We\u2019ll look for those. Thanks a bunch.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Paul Knight from Janney Capital. Your line is open.", "Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets", "Hi, guys, this is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess to start, I was a little surprised on the strength in European academic. I expected you coming off of a soft comp, but I expected some incremental acceleration here, but the strong I think you guys said double-digit growth was ahead of my expectations. So I just want to get some color there. And what are you guys hearing from customers on the ground in that government academic sector in Europe? Because I've also heard some budget numbers were released that weren't adhering to the EU restriction regulations on GDP ratios for next year. So just thoughts on whether it was flushing as well or commentary would be very helpful.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I\u2019ll ask Gene to handle some more color, but I think the -- its interesting that in Europe you\u2019ll hear us talk about broad base throughout this discussion. But clearly it was broad based in Europe. I mean almost every geography in Europe delivered good results this quarter. So it wasn\u2019t just a U.K. initiative or German initiative. It was kind of throughout Europe we saw this kind of response and it was -- some of it was pent up, some of it was clearly as a result of the new products that we\u2019re bringing into the market. And our sense is that, this is not a one quarter dynamic. Gene, you want to go into the details.", "Gene Cassis", "Yes. I think you did a pretty good job, Doug. But I would just add some color that, a lot of the strength that we saw in our European markets centered around our new QTof mass spec commentary offerings, and I think its somewhat of a product specific or a system specific strength that we had in that business. So, a combination of funding levels and a very competitive position based on new product launches primarily in high end mass spec commentary will grow the European government in academic growth.", "Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets", "Okay. And just a couple follow-ups to that. Would you say sentiment is still pretty strong then on outward looking for your customers? And then, I guess the other kind of two quick ones I have, follow-up is -- your orders were strong in China at the end of 2Q, you\u2019re citing strength in orders again 3Q, maybe a modest improvement in 4Q on revenues from China. When do think those orders will be pulled through? Is it more of a 6 to 9 tail? And I guess, I\u2019ll leave it at that, there is plenty of other people in the queue.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think it\u2019s hard to tell given the strength of the concern on the product customers with this whole corruption crackdown and concern. I think its good sign that we\u2019re able to actually book these orders, but it\u2019s still tough to get through the payment processes and the bank clearances in order to get revenue recognition. So, that\u2019s where the Nitty hits the Gritty I\u2019d say in this process. And until we see a more broad based sign of that, again this is largely in the Beijing area in the government controlled segment, but we haven\u2019t seen that loosen up yet.", "Gene Cassis", "The color that I\u2019d add to that is that we probably saw the biggest change in trajectory in the first quarter, and for the last two quarters we have seen a level of stability in demand. I\u2019ll bite at a lower level than traditionally we\u2019ve seen in that marketplace, but we have a backlog build and so I think there is some reason for some cautious optimism as we go into the fourth quarter that we\u2019ll see some of these shipments in revenues be recognized.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Okay.", "Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Gene Cassis", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company", "Hi, thanks, good morning. Just a question on the LC business also. Obviously you built a very strong franchise and the results clearly reflect that. I'm just curious, I know there have been some new competitive entries there. So perhaps you could talk about kind of the competitive landscape and maybe pricing as well, just given obviously the market is becoming or has been quite attractive. Have you seen any changes either on the competitive or pricing front? And then going forward how do you kind of view Waters' position from a competitive standpoint?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure Amanda. I think to be fair, we face competitive offerings regularly in this industry. And I do think it\u2019s fair to say that many in the industry have been playing catch up to come up to par with our kind of offerings. So it\u2019s not surprising that people make a fanfare about their latest product offering. It\u2019s a little unusual to have such a fanfare post pick on where most people plan to deliver their new products. But it\u2019s a normal occurrence to us. I think you can see from our results that pricing is not suffering. Our margins, we\u2019re strong in the quarter. We don\u2019t see and frankly we -- we\u2019ve been asked this question year-in and year-out about price sensitivity. We have to compete, but very rarely do we see our overall price strategy suffering as a result of new product introductions by anyone. There have been low cost competitors, low priced competitors out there from time and memorial. They will always exist, but they don\u2019t typically have a significant impact on us. And I don\u2019t know, if they\u2019re having significant inroads in the LC market place then God bless them, then market must be even stronger than we think it is for us to be delivering almost 10% growth than them taking share. So, I\u2019ll leave that to you to decide whether that\u2019s happening.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company", "Got it, okay. And then just on the bench -- you've obviously -- well, you talked a little bit about getting some traction with the new benchtop mass spec platform that you launched recently. Maybe you could talk about that particular opportunity. Have you thought about how to frame that in terms of size? What it could add ultimately for Waters\u2019 over time?", "Gene Cassis", "Yes, I\u2019ll take a stab at that Amanda. We did talk about strength on the sales line for our new QTof offering, but we just began shipping the tandem quadrupole offering late in the third quarter. I think you can appreciate that within mass spec commentary tandem quadrupole sometimes called triple quadrupole mass spec commentary represents the largest market segment. And our new Xevo TQ-S micro really hits the heart of that market place. And we expect that in the fourth quarter you\u2019ll see us ship against a backlog that we\u2019ve built and show some nice strength in applications ranging from DMPK applications through the applied market. So, all through this year we\u2019ve had nice strength based on systems with the QDa. We\u2019ve had very good strength on QTof offerings at the high end, and now I think as we enter the fourth quarter we\u2019re going to be looking at the largest segment of the UPLC MS market and I think have a very strong offering.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Gene Cassis", "You are welcome, Amanda.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Miroslava Minkova from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "Hi, Doug. Hi, Gene. Congrats on a very strong quarter. I wanted to go back to the pharmaceutical rebound. It seems like it is two quarters in a row now. And I was wondering if you could help us understand the drivers behind the rebound. Is it a replacement cycle that\u2019s occurring after several years of subdued demand? Is it the new instruments that you have launched? How would you characterize it and how sustainable do you think it is looking out?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well Miroslava, I think its all of those. I think that\u2019s the interesting part about the strength in the pharma market for Waters\u2019. Clearly in the India piece which is largely aimed at generic drug manufactures you\u2019ve had a multiple quarter period of slow growth going back prior to this year due to regulatory concerns, due to macroeconomic and political concerns. So that\u2019s a pent up replacement demand, its regulatory that\u2019s driving that market. When you look at the launch of the QDa detector clearly is a new product, new capability initiative that\u2019s -- but really mostly aimed at small molecule analysis and mostly in more traditional drug applications. You look at the introduction of our ionKey again aimed at drug development applications be both in biotech and in large pharma. You\u2019ll look at the strong service requirement which cuts across all of those and our service business in spite of companies that want to service all instruments in a company and those initiatives come and go. Our service business continues to be very strong as these companies continue to value the constant uptime of their instruments and what Waters\u2019 brings in that. So, I\u2019ll start getting redundant, so it\u2019s everything, it\u2019s really across the board.", "Gene Cassis", "I\u2019d just like to add one thing, that if you look at the change in trajectory for pharmaceutical demand, one to look at it and say it really started in the fourth quarter of last year. Even the first quarter of this year if I looked at pharmaceutical demand in North America and Europe that was at a mid single-digit rate, but the other, three of the last four quarters we have had results that are pretty similar to what we delivered in this most recent quarter.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "Okay. Thanks for the comment. For Gene, sorry if I missed it, but could you please -- could you quantify the impact of currency on 4Q, EPS? And I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some insight into how you think at current rates it might play down into 2015 again on your bottom line?", "Gene Cassis", "Well, I\u2019m not going to speculate on 2015 at this point, but -- and looking at the third quarter just the way currency moved through the quarter afforded us pretty neutral impact of currency on the quarter that we just reported. As we look at the fourth quarter we\u2019re estimating that the effective foreign currency primarily based on what's outputting with the yen is going to result in some place between $0.02 and $0.03 worth of pain in the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s about the extent of it, Miroslava.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Gene Cassis", "You are welcome.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "And Carolina, I think we\u2019re approaching the bottom of the hour. So, maybe we can take one more question.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Our final question or comment comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Hi, thanks guys. A question on REIMS, I know you highlighted this at ASMS. Can you talk a little bit, now that you own the technology about regulatory plans for the iKnife, anything on pricing? Does this add any sort of consumable stream? And then going back to Doug's question earlier, do you need to make any sort of channel investments here?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Sure, I\u2019ll handle that. Gene wants to interject something here.", "Gene Cassis", "Yes. On the last question that we got on FX, when I talked about $0.02 or $0.03 that was versus prior guidance. If I look at the full year impact of currency on the fourth quarter its close to $0.06. So, I just wanted to make sure that that was clear.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Okay. So, Tycho as it relates to the iKnife, this is a very intriguing technology. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working with Imperial College and the original developers who actually came out of Hungary but has been working together for a number of years now where our Manchester mass spec operation has had a close relationship with Imperial College and have developed this technology that\u2019s we think proprietary that enabled a surgeon to while he\u2019s working on cancerous tissue to send that molecular sample immediately to a mass spec to be told whether he is in good tissue or in cancerous tissue. That\u2019s the theory and particularly in cases like breast cancer and then neuro cancers where the importance of taking all tumor but not more than tumor is clinically imperative. The initial research results are very interesting shall I say. It\u2019s important to note that this is a research initiative now. Its being developed principally in London but the amount of interest that\u2019s coming out of all of our academic cancer centers I must say is compelling where almost every one who has looked as this is interested in pursuing it. I want to emphasize that this is a future initiative. This is not available for sale today. It\u2019s going to take development. We\u2019ve got to make some decisions over a multi-year period of how this thing comes to market? How it gets sold? What the relationships are? That\u2019s going to come subsequent to this year. But this technology not only useful for surgical applications but this REINS technology could be very useful and we\u2019re working with some large food companies on food safety of being able to tell adulterants in milk or whether a particular meat sample is horse meat or hamburger. Very interesting user friendly capabilities that we think could well be enabling. Those less regulated applications could come to market soon, probably in 2015 while the most clinical applications are likely to come later. So was that enough, Tycho?", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Yes, now that\u2019s helpful. And then for the follow-up, maybe for Gene. I know you don't really want to comment on 2015, but if I looked at Street's modeling about 90 bps of operating margin expansion. Given I guess, Doug what you just talked about in terms of development for iKnife, is that a reasonable assessment on the operating side for 2015? I'm just trying to understand how much we need to think about next year being a year of reinvestment, if you will.", "Gene Cassis", "Well, I think we typically talked about \u201915 on my January call. But when we talk about the Waters\u2019 model in general, we always try to talk about the opportunity to get a little bit of operating leverage and a top line growth of mid single-digit typically as the point where we start to be able to see some operating leverage. So, at this point I wouldn\u2019t suggest that you think about the year 2015 much differently than you have previously.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Agreed. We don\u2019t think that this iKnife initiative maybe we\u2019ll have to reallocate some resources to support it. But we don\u2019t think it dramatically affects the traditional Waters\u2019 P&L model.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay, great. We\u2019ll leave it at that. Thank you.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "All right. Well thank you all for putting up with us this long. Before concluding the call I\u2019d just like to reiterate. I think why we\u2019re so excited. You clearly saw in this quarter us focus on the broad-basedness of our capabilities, broad based geographically. So almost everywhere except for China we saw our businesses produce very strong results. If you looked at our product lines, chemistry, service, instruments, LC instruments, mass spec instruments we saw our business perform well. And finally just look at the phase of our P&L, you\u2019ll see the sales growth, margins improving at a faster rate than sales, you\u2019d see SG&A held under control, but its not stifling the growth of the business. We\u2019re clearly investing more in R&D than anywhere else in the P&L. The buyback continues on the margin to affect better EPS growth. So, manifested very simply in that going back to the breadth of our business capabilities, I think the outlook is very promising. So, whether it\u2019s this management that will be with you for a while longer or the next one, I think the stewardship is in good hands. So thanks a lot. We\u2019ll update you on our next call.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call. We appreciate you being able to change your schedules in order to be with us late this afternoon. It was a result of the weather emergency and the mandatory travel restrictions that were announced this afternoon by the Governor of Massachusetts that we decided our best way to deal with it was to release earnings at the close of business today rather than wait for tomorrow morning when we weren\u2019t sure what the conditions would allow us to do. So, thank you for bearing with us.", "With me on today\u2019s call is Gene Cassis, the Waters\u2019 CFO; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Today, I am going to start with an overview of the business and Gene will follow with details of our financial results and an outlook for our business in 2015. But before we start, I\u2019d like Gene to cover the cautionary language.", "Gene Cassis", "Well, thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for the first quarter of 2015 and for full year 2015. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our Form 10-K Annual Report for fiscal year ending December 31, 2013 in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning\u2019s press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2015.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly compatible GAAP measures is attached to the company\u2019s earnings release issued this afternoon. In our discussion of results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials and that\u2019s included in this afternoon\u2019s press release. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, Gene. Well, I am pleased to tell you that our 8% constant currency revenue increase in the fourth quarter was a strong finish to 2014 and resulted in full year sales growth of 6%, a rate that\u2019s actually in line with our original full year outlook. And I think that\u2019s notable, because you will recall that our first quarter was significantly weaker than originally planned. So, we saw significant strengthening in the business as the year progressed.", "Looking at the full year, the big story was stronger demand from our pharmaceutical sector. This strength was geographically broad-based with improved demand from both research and quality control segments. So, with this increase in global pharmaceutical business that offset the softer demand that we and others saw in China throughout most of 2014. Consistent with our history and carefully managed \u2013 we carefully managed our expenses through the year, while launching new instrument systems and integrating a handful of small acquired businesses. So, for the full year, our adjusted earnings per share were up 9% after foreign currency headwinds reduced earnings per share by about $0.22 or 4%. Looking at the fourth quarter constant currency sales for the corporation were up 8% with instrument systems growing 6% and our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables up a strong 10%.", "If you look at our operating divisions Waters Division sales grew by 10%, again at constant currency. The strength that we saw in the quarter for the Waters Division was very encouraging and as the division saw a similar growth in the fourth quarter 2013. So that made for a tough base of comparison. Our TA Instrument Division sales declined at 5% in the fourth quarter. And I will describe the contributing dynamics shortly.", "Currency and translation reduced our sales growth by 5% in the quarter as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening against all major currencies. Geographically and for the Waters Division sales in the U.S. were up 12%. In the quarter we saw a continued strength in pharmaceutical spending and healthy government and academic growth. Industrial chemical growth declined against a very strong result in the prior year. For the full year sales in the U.S. were up 8%. Sales growth in Europe for the Waters Division and at constant currency was up 10%, similarly to the U.S. we saw a strong pharmaceutical, government and academic spending. For the full year Waters Division European sales were up 6% and benefited from stronger pharmaceutical sales growth throughout most of the year.", "We came into the year with some concern that general economic conditions would limit our growth in Europe. However, the large proportion of our sales to pharmaceutical end markets in combination with very positive uptake of our advanced mass spectrometry instruments by academic and government labs allowed us to deliver a very solid full year performance. In Asia, China is our largest market and I am pleased to report that shipment volume increased nicely in the fourth quarter and revenues grew 13% for the Waters Division. Consistent with Europe and the U.S., sales to pharma and government supported research labs drove the overall sales growth in China.", "Though I feel it\u2019s premature on the basis of one quarter to believe that business conditions in China will allow us to grow at a much accelerated rate in future quarters, we are encouraged by the fourth quarter\u2019s improvement. Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan were up moderately in the quarter with stronger pharmaceutical and chemical industry demand offsetting a decline in public sector spending. In the quarter Waters Division sales in India were up over 20%. The 2014 growth in India was primarily associated with higher instrument, software and service sales from the generic drug industry. Top line growth strengthened across the year and we believe that last year\u2019s business momentum will sustain into 2015 as drug firms continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and make needed investments to ensure regulatory compliance. Our sales in Asian markets outside of Japan, China and India grew moderately in the quarter.", "Our TA Instruments Division saw a mid-single digit decline in sales in the quarter admittedly against a strong result delivered in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Geographically TA shipments in China were weaker than expected as the conversion of orders to sales proceeded at a slower pace. Globally sales growth for the division was affected by a generally slower industrial, chemical climate.", "Now I would like to discuss some product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters Division in the quarter. The division\u2019s recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables grew at 11% rate in the quarter. Chromatography consumable sales were strong in the quarter and grew by 8%. Consumables growth was strongest in Asia and in the Americas. Overall, the business continued to see strong uptake of UPLC column offerings including our more recently introduced line of CORTECS columns. The Waters Division service business also performed very well in the quarter, including a 13% rate with balanced strength across all major regions in the world.", "For the full year and at constant currency, Waters Division service revenues grew 10%. Waters Division instrument system sales grew 9% in the fourth quarter. LC, LC/MS and informatics sales all contributed to the strong and balanced performance. And in the quarter, we began to see a positive impact from the new UPLC-MS systems launched mid year in at ASMS. Instrument systems continued to benefit from the rapid uptake of ACQUITY QDa, an advanced mass spectrometry-based LC detector that we introduced in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "On our October earnings call I described for you the REIMS technology that we acquired as part of our recent MediMass acquisition. You may recall that REIMS is an atmospheric ionization technique with potentially a broad range of applications, including a longer term potential usage as a medical device to optimize surgical outcomes, notably for certain oncology procedures.", "REIMS technology is complementary to other atmospheric pressure ionization techniques that we offer and are very excited about its benefits to our recently announced health science initiative. This initiative, which we formally organized in 2014, recognizes an important transition in medical research that demands a suite of advanced technologies, including research grade mass spectrometry to attain a more comprehensive understanding of disease. This molecular-based understanding will result in more effective predictive diagnostic and therapeutic tools to cost effectively manage human health.", "I am pleased to tell you that in the fourth quarter we began to fund the new internal research program to allow us to investigate and further develop REIMS technology for potential future advanced medical procedures. This represents a different type of investment for Waters as we have historically concentrated our research efforts on product development plans that were more closely aligned with the needs of our existing customer base. However, we view the value of this new embodiment of mass spectrometry technology and its potential medical applications as sufficiently compelling to cause us to slightly alter our strategy and incrementally invest in this effort. In addition during the fourth quarter, we also acquired access to advanced mass spec technology to more broadly support long-term applications for our health science initiative.", "So, in summarizing our fourth quarter results, I am very pleased with the level of top and bottom line growth that we delivered in a challenging currency environment. The strength in pharmaceutical spending in the second and third quarters continued nicely in the fourth. Our recurring revenues also grew impressively, indicating increased instrument utilization and demonstrating the strategic value in offering a full portfolio of technical services and superior column offerings. For our TA Instruments Division, the slower annual sales growth was primarily a function of weaker chemical industry spending. We feel that TA has a strong pipeline of new products that will drive growth in its core business in 2015 and beyond.", "Before looking to the future, I want to note that we generated record free cash flow in 2014, including a $115 million in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to 2015, we believe that market conditions will be as good as or potentially better than those in 2014 supported by continued strong global pharmaceutical demand for our products. We are hopeful that business conditions in China will normalize and that our TA division will also grow at a rate that is more aligned with its historical performance. Gene will provide you with a more detailed 2015 outlook shortly.", "On the product side and for the Waters Division, we will continue to benefit from the rapid uptake of recently introduced strategic instrument platforms. In addition, at our upcoming technical conferences, we look forward to introducing new products and programs to benefit 2015 sales growth.", "Well, before turning you over to Gene, I would like to say a few words about our non-operational plans. In 2015, we expect another year of strong free cash flow and anticipate continued capital deployment toward our share repurchase program. On the M&A front, it is highly unlikely that you will see us in pursuit of a major acquisition and more likely that we will continue to target smaller bolt-on businesses and technical acquisitions. On a more personal note, the search for my replacement continues and I feel we have made significant progress in terms of candidate identification and development to complete this process in roughly the same timeframe as I have originally put forward.", "So, on closing, I want to reiterate my confidence in our focused business strategy, the discipline that we have demonstrated now over a couple of decades of primarily growing our business organically has enabled us to have industry leading ROIC and consistently higher operating margins and cash flow. Our results in 2014 confirm the advantages of this strategy. Our employees have been and will continue to be a significant competitive advantage for Waters. They embody and reflect our business strategy and their focused commitment to be the best at what they do in order to ensure our customer success. I personally appreciate their efforts and feel privileged to oversee this great organization.", "Now, here is Gene for a review of our fourth quarter financials.", "Gene Cassis", "Well, thank you very much, Doug and good afternoon all. As Doug mentioned, our fourth quarter sales grew by 8% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales by 5% resulting in 3% overall sales growth. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share were up 17% to $1.99 this quarter and that\u2019s up from $1.70 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.80 for the quarter versus $1.65 last year. Attached to this morning\u2019s press release, you can find a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings.", "Looking at our top line geographically before foreign currency exchange effects, sales within the United States and Europe will reach up 10%. Our growth in Asia outside of Japan was up 8% and in Japan again before currency translation sales were flat with last year. On the product front and in constant currency, Waters Division instrument system sales increased by 9% and recurring revenues grew by 11%. Within our TA Instruments Division, total sales decreased by 5% in comparison to a strong quarter last year.", "Now, I\u2019d like to comment on our fourth quarter non-GAAP financial performance. Gross margins came in at 60.1%, up from 59.5% in the prior year as the benefits of higher sales volume and positive mix dynamics offset the negative foreign currency headwinds. Moving down to P&L, SG&A expenses were up 3% on a constant currency basis. The impact of currency translation reduced this growth slightly. R&D expenses, including ongoing spending associated with the medical initiative that Doug had mentioned, increased by 7% again before foreign currency translation.", "On the tax front, our full year operating tax rate came in at 13%. This rate was lower than what we had expected due to the positive effects of higher sales volume in lower tax locations and a $2 million benefit realized as the United States R&D tax credit was reestablished in the fourth quarter. Applying its full year rate to our cumulative earnings moved our effective fourth quarter operating tax rate to 10%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $7.6 million and our average share count came in at around 84 million shares, about 2 million shares lower than in the 2013 quarter. This is a result of our continued share repurchase programs.", "On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled close to $2.1 billion and debt totaled close to $1.5 billion bringing us to a net cash position of about $590 million. As for the quarter\u2019s share repurchases, we bought 655,000 shares of our common stock for $74 million. This leaves $769 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase programs. We define free cash as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any non-cash benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. Our fourth quarter generated healthy free cash flow at about $150 million after funding $21 million for capital expenditures, a level which does not include $2 million of spending associated with major facility construction.", "Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 68 days this quarter, down 1 day from fourth quarter last year and sequentially down 5 days from the third quarter. In the quarter, inventories declined by $23 million in comparison to the third quarter. So, for the full year, 2014 sales grew about 6% before currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales growth by nearly 2 percentage points. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted shares were up around 9% to $5.47 per share versus $5.04 last year. Notably, currency translation reduced earnings by about $0.22 versus the prior year, somewhat masking the more impressive organic operating leverage of our business.", "Looking ahead to 2015, our outlook assumes a continuation of the market conditions that we saw in 2014. Specifically, we are envisioning stable increases in our recurring revenue sales, in combination with continued growth in our sales for our broadly defined pharmaceutical sector. We feel these factors and a return to growth for our TA Instruments Division will combined to help support a mid-single digit organic sales increase in 2015. Currency at today\u2019s rates is expected to reduce 2015 sales growth by about 4%.", "Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2014, as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. We expect to manage our constant currency operating sales expenses to grow at a rate that is less than our constant currency sales growth rate. Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $31 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be between 13% and 13.5% next year. This rate assumes that the U.S. R&D tax credit that benefited 2014 by about half a point will not be available in 2015.", "We plan to continue our share repurchase program throughout this year and we want to do that at a rate that will result in an average diluted share count of about 83 million shares. Rolling all of this together and again, on a non-gap basis, full year 2015 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $5.55 to $5.80.", "Looking at the first quarter of 2015, we are estimating that sales will grow at a high-single digit rate due to a relatively favorable base of comparison and for additional business days in the quarter. Currency translation at today\u2019s rates is expected to reduce first quarter sales growth by about 5%. Rolling all these factors together, we expect first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of between $0.95 and $1.05. Doug?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, Gene. At this point operator, I think we can open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is now open.", "Dan Leonard", "Thank you. Can you comment on the book to bill in China, were booking is greater than revenue growth?", "Gene Cassis", "Sure. I mean, I think that we ended up seeing a significant backlog, a reduction as we closed the year out. We did see throughout the year a little bit of build in terms of the order rate. So, it seems that the order rate was improving, but one of the big dynamics that worked in our favor in the fourth quarter was that funds were available to allow us to complete some shipments against the order backlog that we had come into the quarter with.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Dan, you will recall that in we faced two separate issues in China. And I think most people are seeing this is that delays in actually getting the process of orders to the point where they can be viewed as a legitimate purchase order. And then even once the purchase order is received, the banking system slowdowns of getting money authorized to support a shipment were slow. We clearly saw some progress on that flow of money. So, we think we are beginning on those scores to see some breakthrough, but we are reluctant to believe that it\u2019s fully something that we can forecast improving is in the short-term. So, that\u2019s the state of the state.", "Dan Leonard", "Got it. And then my follow-up question, Gene, can you quantify the EPS, negative EPS impacts from foreign currency in your 2015 guidance?", "Gene Cassis", "Well, yes, I think as we had mentioned earlier that in 2014 the effect of foreign currency reduced the growth in EPS by about 4 percentage points. And looking at where rates are right now, we expect that, that impact will be a little bit greater, maybe a couple of points greater in 2015. Now, we have seen some pretty dramatic swings in currency lately. So, it\u2019s unclear whether the rates that we are seeing now are really going to be the rates that we deal with throughout the year, but if we do use the current rates and look at our projected mix of sales, that\u2019s where we think \u2013 what we think the impact will be.", "Dan Leonard", "Understood. Thank you.", "Gene Cassis", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hey, thanks. Either Doug or Gene, can you talk about the incremental spending around REIMS? You kind of alluded to maybe stepping up some of the efforts there, understanding obviously you want to grow expenses less than revenues, but how should we think about the incremental investment?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "You want to\u2026", "Gene Cassis", "Yes, I can start off. I mean, it\u2019s we actually did start to fund a program during the fourth quarter and we are looking within the fourth quarter, there were about a couple of million dollars worth of R&D spend that we can attribute to that program. So, you can look at that as sort of maybe a base rate going forward that will likely build off of. So, hopefully that gives you a little feel for what the level of investment is as we move into this year.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "And we have looked at the opportunity to accelerate that program, Tycho. You are talking about a program that could look at accelerated spending in the $5 million to $10 million annual level. We think we have some ways to look at programs that can contribute to not making that totally felt in the P&L, but to the extent, we are willing to bet on that that\u2019s all reflected in the guidance that Gene provided.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And then separately the pharma growth you have seen has been notable and seems broad-based, can you maybe just talk about how much of this is a function replacement cycle really hitting its stride, how much of it is from QDa uptake or alternatively share gains, other factors you may want to call out?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I think it\u2019s probably all of those. Certainly, the QDa has been very successful, but it certainly didn\u2019t add up to the 8 to 10 points of organic growth. It may have contributed 1 point of that. We have \u2013 I have been talking about the pent-up replacement demand for a while and some people believe that others didn\u2019t. I think we are seeing some of that as some anecdotal evidence that the industry went through so much pulling back that it was inevitable that at some point we would see some contribution as a result of pent-up replacement demand. We see some evidence of that. But we are seeing a big return to growth in India that we had a couple of years of repressed growth. I think most of that\u2019s kind of macroeconomic and regulatorily inspired. We are seeing very good response in the biotech segment of the marketplace, that\u2019s particularly vibrant area. And we are not seeing any reduction coming out of the top 20, 30 pharmaceutical customers. It certainly stopped being a drag in our growth. So and also again there is a piece here or a piece there, another piece is the strength that we are seeing on our informatics platform, to some extent that represents big pharma continuing to upgrade their information networks. But it also reflects the investments that we have made in the new unified platform and the response to that has been good both at the instrument level and at the larger network information level. So they were all contributing.", "Tycho Peterson", "Can you quantify what\u2019s embedded in guidance for pharma for this year?", "Gene Cassis", "Yes. I mean as we look at pharma as the broadly defined pharmaceutical, it\u2019s being more than half of our business. We are assuming in our guidance that pharmaceutical growth rate is at the corporate mid-single digit growth. It\u2019s slower than we saw in the fourth quarter, so if we are lucky and the world stays the way it\u2019s going now, there is some opportunity there.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Thanks. And I will hop back in the queue.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel", "Hey, good afternoon guys.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Hi Doug.", "Doug Schenkel", "So within the Waters Division it was very solid, a pretty balanced beat in the fourth quarter. One of the biggest drivers looks to have been services though which continue to trend for the year. And I am making an educated guess because we don\u2019t have precise numbers yet, but it looks like Waters Division services may have grown about 9% year-over-year constant currency and this follows a pretty strong 2013, which again was better than the division average. I am just wondering if you would talk us through what\u2019s driving such robust services growth to rates that exceeds Waters instruments and Waters chemistry. And how would you describe sustainability and I guess while I am on the topic could you just talk us through the current margin profile of the Waters Division services?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, maybe I can handle the strategic question and Gene can jump in on the profitability. Yes, Doug, the \u2013 we have been doing very well in the Waters services you would find that the bulk of our high growth comes from planned development, as we instruments particularly these sophisticated systems that compass not only LC, but mass spectrometry and informatics, chemistry solutions. As we have shifted to pushing instrument systems, we find that the growth in plans extended plans has been very high. The beauty of this strategy is that they stay somewhat immune to outside forces such as third-party. Customers invest very heavily in our services and support to keep that going. Embedded within those plans are a lot of compliance services as well informatics services. So that has been exceptionally healthy and it makes up a very large portion of the growth.", "On top of that, our services also consist of a fairly large parts business. And as you build your base and you keep on getting your install base moving, the amount of instruments going into the base versus instruments being retired just it exceeds that retirement and we see this increasing momentum. So for us the services business is very strong. We feed it with new products and services. We feed the organization in terms of manpower to keep it supported. So for us it\u2019s a perpetuating strength and we feel that our strategy keeps it fairly well contained within the confines of the Waters\u2019 infrastructure and doesn\u2019t allow too much outside force to come in and disrupted us. As you have pointed out, this performance has been pretty consistent not only over the last couple of years, but over many, many years. I mean, this was a particularly good year, but it hasn\u2019t varied downward by more than a couple of points. So, it\u2019s one of the reasons of this strong consistent kind of definable growth. Gene, do you want to talk about the profitability in that business?", "Gene Cassis", "Sure. If we take a look at our \u2013 our service business is a very attractive business for us. Interestingly at the gross margin line, it\u2019s probably slightly dilutive. A lot of the costs that we have are labor costs are the people that we have in the field. But if you look at it at the operating margin line, it is accretive to the corporation\u2019s operating margin, in the same way the chemistry business is. So, it\u2019s certainly something that as it becomes a bigger part of our mix, it does have a positive effect on our operating income.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay. Thanks for all of that. Very interesting and helpful. And I think somewhat related to that and I guess as my follow-up, if we look down below the revenue line into the expense line, you talked a little bit about R&D and that picked up a little bit in this quarter and if you actually factor in FX, it probably increased a decent amount. And I think for good reason most of us would agree that the incremental investment in REIMS in the clinical side. At the SG&A line, you increased, I think it was 1% year-over-year on a reported basis, on reported revenue growth of north of 3%, organic growth of I think close to 8%. On the surface, this actually seems a little bit light. I am just wondering is there anything to point to you in terms of product or geographic mix? I mean, this as you have just described, Gene, could relate to the higher services mix, is there a timing issue? I guess really what I am getting at is, is this the type of leverage that we can expect as we think about 2015 moving forward over the next few quarters? Thank you.", "Gene Cassis", "It\u2019s interesting, Doug, that if we look over the past five quarters, four of them have been pretty impressive in terms of the organic growth rate. And if I think about the guidance that we had for next year of mid single-digit top line growth, there really is not a lot of SG&A leverage that\u2019s assumed within that growth rate. And that\u2019s one of the factors that was considered when we gave you the guidance on the EPS line. Now, the one thing is that we typically have a base growth \u2013 a base growth of our expenses at the 3% or 4% level. And so if you look at some of the results that we have delivered in recent quarters, we have been very good at controlling expenses. But again businesses grow nicely and we have to make investments, specifically in our field service operation to make sure that we continue to support our customer base. So, I would just say that I think we have been conservative in our guidance in the amount of leverage that we forecasted for 2015.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay. Thanks again. Stay safe and stay warm.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Isaac Ro", "Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Just want to ask a question about the impact of falling oil prices. It seems sort of like sort of a very topical thing and while I understand it\u2019s not the biggest end market you have just maybe what your expectations are just given the energy CapEx in a lot of areas is going to be down most likely 25% or 30% this year. Just trying to get a sense of how you think that will impact your business on a net basis given all the puts and takes?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Isaac, not very much, directly to the petroleum industry, our sales are miniscule. It probably matters more to the industrial chemical segment as their feed stocks go down in cost, maybe it stimulates some of their spending. So, that\u2019s probably a longer term dynamic if the cost of those petroleum derived feed stocks go down, but I don\u2019t think you will notice the decline in the cost of energy from a revenue point of view nearly at all conceivable, because we sell to other divisions within the big oil companies that might have some small derivative effect, but I would not anticipate that. And as a consumer of energy, it\u2019s likely that our costs, particularly freight costs could be meaningfully reduced, remains to be seen, but I would anticipate that.", "Isaac Ro", "Got it. Thank you. And then just to follow-up on the tax rate for this year, it sounded like even without the R&D tax credit, tax rate this year should be down a little bit. And if I went back the clock maybe 18 months ago, there was some concern that maybe a little bit of tax credit to the upside. So just maybe the reasons why tax rate looks like it will be at least in line if not better this year?", "Gene Cassis", "Well, I think some of the reasons why we have seen some favorable moves in tax rate of course some of the products that we manufacture in Singapore and Ireland did very well on the revenue side. And also we have a more significant component of the TA mix that\u2019s U.S. manufactured. So, as the shift moved a little bit more towards the Waters Division that was beneficial to our tax rate. I think that we are looking at product mix and geographical mix for this year, 2015, to be similar to 2014. And we are not discounting the chance that we get another R&D tax credit from the United States government, but we haven\u2019t taken that to the bank. So, we are I think realistic in the 13% outlook for this year and I think there could be some upside, but when you have tax rates that vary from the very favorable rate that we have in Singapore to the mid to high 30s that we have in the United States, it doesn\u2019t take much of a shift in terms of geographic and product mix to move tax rates around for us.", "Isaac Ro", "Got it. Okay, thanks guys. Go Patriots.", "Gene Cassis", "Thank you, Isaac.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Miroslava Minkova with Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Miroslava Minkova", "Hi, good afternoon. Let me just start with Europe. It has been very strong \u2013 impressively strong for you in the fourth quarter and over the course of \u201814, how do you think about \u201815 in Europe in particular as well as given the mix of economic headlines that keep flowing from the continent?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The headlines are probably no more fearsome than they were through most of this year, Miroslava. We are certainly watchful as we began the year. Our organization was a little bit more optimistic I would say than we were and then they performed better than even that optimistic level. I think underlying it still comes down to the strength in the pharmaceutical sector that when you cut through all the noise, the pharmaceutical sector marches to a drummer that\u2019s different than the Greek crisis or the Spanish crisis or something like that. So, probably the surprising thing that held up was the academic and government sector not only in Europe, but specifically there where we saw good results through most of the year. So, there is one area that we continue to monitor it\u2019s that, but of course, the pharmaceutical segment is by far the most important dynamic.", "Miroslava Minkova", "Right, thank you.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "As that points out to me, the new products did well all over, but did particularly well in Europe both the new mass spec products and the QDa received a very strong push from our European results.", "Miroslava Minkova", "Okay, great. That\u2019s great commentary. And on the TA division, I appreciate it was a weak comp \u2013 I am sorry, a tough comp this quarter. Are you assuming that it will rebound as we go over the course of \u201815 or could there be a period of when chemical customers might be seeing some leftover pressure? Help us understand the cadence of the TA revenues.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I would say we are quite confident that the results will be better than we saw in the fourth quarter. There is the confluence of events that saw a mid-single digit decline in organic revenue. We have examined that very closely and think that the events they are quite definable. And as we look at a number of underlying dynamics coming out as in 2015, we are confident that that\u2019s not likely to be repeated. Early indications albeit early in the first month of the New Year are indicative that that momentum has definitely improved. So, we are not being overly confident, but the mid-single digit kind of level that Gene has talked about, we think is doable in this coming year.", "Miroslava Minkova", "Okay, great. Thank you so much. Stay away from the storm.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I don\u2019t think we are going to be able to do that.", "Operator", "Our next questions here will come from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Amanda Murphy", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So, just, I guess I had a follow-up on Tycho\u2019s question earlier on the replacement cycle. So and this maybe a hard one to answer, but I am just curious if you take the broad sort of LC install base and then the LC/MS install base, is there a way to think about the aging there more generally, so I am just trying to get a magnitude of what a replacement cycle might look like on both sides, is it 10% of the install base, it\u2019s right for an upgrade or 20%, any sense of how that might look and\u2026?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Art, do you want to shelter on that?", "Art Caputo", "Interestingly, on the LC side of the business, what we have been experiencing over the last few years has been somewhat the opposite. The cycle used to run 7 years pretty consistently. They seem to be \u2013 accounts seem to be stretching the cycles out on the LC side. In some cases, 8, 9, 10 years on the core basic traditional equipment. What we have had that has been offsetting that is the strategy that basically adds to that equipment. So, when you look at products likely the QDa and other add-on types of capabilities that we supply our upgrades, we look to offset those increased replacement cycles with additional capabilities which has worked out quite well for us on the HPLC side. Totally separate from that cycle, we do continue to see UPLC transition and replace some of the HPLC business. So, it\u2019s not necessarily replacement cycle as much as it is than upgrade cycle. So, the dynamics are in a straightforward as a continuous where at replace. There are some other things going on and we try to manage that.", "The cycles on mass spectrometry are very different from LC side. It\u2019s not yet fully matured out. There are still a lot of increases, performance going on across various types of mass spectrometers. On top of that, as I mentioned, we have added some capabilities with the QDa where we are trying to add HPLC detection. So, the mass spectrometry cycles tends to be much shorter where new capabilities will induce people to replace or expand at a much faster rate. So, we enjoy a much more vibrant activity on the mass spectrometry side which plays well for us.", "And I would add one more thing and that is that, with Waters, the biggest leverage we have in the marketplace is we have a very strong lead position in the separations business. We have a strong lead position in mass spectrometry and we compound this leverage by continually looking at the new applications and new capabilities trying to create new markets, new segments. The health sciences area is a classic where we are constantly bumping into new problems that need to be solved as people move from the discovery phase into this translational medicine phase. So, we can\u2019t really talk about a one-size-fits-all in the broad scheme of how we manage the business. We have it segmented into multiple components across the company. When we put it all together over the last few years, we are really seeing it start to work and that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s driving the growth on a global basis for us.", "Amanda Murphy", "On the HPLC side, are you seeing that 8 to 9 years come down a bit then or is it still running at about that 8 to 9 years?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, one or two quarters is a little bit too hard to call. I think intuitively we are beginning to see a little bit of what I\u2019d call pent-up replacement demand largely from the pharmaceutical industry who has pushed off this replacement cycle and dealt with reducing headcount. So, I think that has to account for some of our growth that\u2019s disproportionate with the industry\u2019s growth. So, we are so strong in the pharmaceutical market.", "Amanda Murphy", "Got it. And then just one quick one on the column side of the business, so I need you to say that the attach rate for UPLC was pretty high sort of 80% to 90%, so are you still seeing that? I know you have had some new products there and so curious if you are still seeing that and also is there a risk to that going forward?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "The UPLC attach rate continues to grow. It\u2019s growing at a rate faster than the rest of our HPLC lines and we continue to extend that capability by adding new chemical moieties to the substrate and new products. So, the UPLC column business is quite a success story for and it continues to expand. And we see very little competition attacking that specific performance range in the chemistry line.", "Gene Cassis", "Yes. And Amanda, I think the attach rate continues to be very robust in the ballpark that you spoke about. I think the big opportunity that still I think is largely in front of us. But as we begin to see more migration of UPLC technology into quality control applications, we think we have a wonderful reputation for quality of these column chemistries for the people who develop methods. And if the past is any indication of what the future would bring that, that\u2019s a great place to be once the new methodology goes into quality control.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "And that\u2019s when these new drugs though we develop using UPLC come into quality control, but they are still not into the mainstream of that process yet.", "Amanda Murphy", "Got it. Thanks guys.", "Gene Cassis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Question will come from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Brandon Couillard", "Thanks. Gene, quickly on the currency for next year, can you walk us through how you get to the negative 4% headwind on the revenue line, exactly what the spot rates are that you are assuming from our end maybe close to\u2026.", "Gene Cassis", "In general, if I think about the currency story for 2014, it was largely a yen-based story. But as we look at 2015, there is going to be a significant contribution to the top line from the diminished value of the euro and we continue to see some drag for the yen. If I look at sort of the rates that we are looking at for the first quarter, we are looking at a euro that\u2019s at about the $1.13 level, a yen at the $1.17, $1.18 level and on the cost side for us a pound and this works little bit in our favor at $1.50.", "Brandon Couillard", "Great. And for the full year, you are assuming basically today\u2019s rates to get the down\u2026", "Gene Cassis", "Yes. I mean, that\u2019s who knows what it\u2019s going to be. And all we can tell you is that listen, if grades are approximately what they are today, this is where the impact is going to be and we are not forecasting how rates are going to move through the year.", "Brandon Couillard", "Okay. And then one more on the outlook, could you give us a feel for the CapEx and operating cash flow?", "Gene Cassis", "Yes, I think on the CapEx side that the big investment opportunity that we have made in recent years is of course on new mass spectrometry facility in Wilmslow and in the later part of this year, we fully occupied that site. And I really don\u2019t see anything on the near-term horizon that\u2019s going to be a large consumer of capital expenditures. So, we are going to go back more towards a maintenance type of a cap level. I think if you saw what the capital expenditure was in the fourth quarter it was in the mid 20s. I mean, maybe projecting that out and thinking of capital expenditures that for the full year might be in the $70 million or $75 million might be a good estimate of what CapEx will like this year.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I think with a free cash flow next year it should be around the $500 million level.", "Gene Cassis", "Yes.", "Brandon Couillard", "Super. Thank you.", "Operator", "Question will come from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hi, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and thanks for braving the storm out there. I really just like to focus a little bit on China. I wonder if you could first give us a sense for what kind of growth you are assuming in China over the course of \u201815 in the company\u2019s overall revenue guidance? And then I wonder Doug if you could reflect a bit more on the comments that you made earlier about the outlook in China. It sounds like and you guys have been pretty consistent on this point, you have seen incrementally positive signs, but you are not willing to call for a really sustained recovery there. Are there specifics that you could point us to or is it more about maybe a mixed picture in terms of certain parts of China as an end market some better, more worse? Thanks so much.", "Gene Cassis", "Yes. Well, I will start off talking about our assumptions for growth in China in 2015. China represents something in the neighborhood of 12% of our sales. And what we saw from the full year on the sales growth for 2014 was very close to flat or just a tiny bit of growth for that business. We think that both looking at the momentum on the order side as well as the shipment side, there is some reason for optimism. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unrealistic to think about China as growing at around the corporate average for next year, so a mid single-digit top line growth rate against what is going to be a tremendously favorable base of comparison is a good base case scenario for us.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "And Steve, I think as you look and try to read the tea leaves in China, this dual track of how orders get processed and then how the financial systems fund that has been something that we face through most of the year in China. And at various times, we saw a little bit of progress on the order side and relatively little flexibility on the financial funding side. The thing \u2013 and I would say roughly we saw maybe a little bit better orders performance in the fourth quarter than we had expected, but we saw real progress with the financial system in being able to fund orders that had been previously booked. And so what begets what in China, I think is a fair question. Does the shutdown of the financial funding lead to reduced orders or kind of different things working on both sides of the equation? We take it as a positive that the funding has improved and our local organization clearly sees that.", "If you look at the projects and the underlying demand that we are seeing from customers and thought leaders in China, nothing has changed. They are still looking for \u2013 you would assume that the boom was still going in China. If you look at the underlying requests, the demand for new capabilities in the multimillion dollar projects that they continue to talk to us about. So if you gauge interest at that level, you would say wow, 2015 is going to be a robust year. So, we try to gauge all of that. I would say from a top down perspective, we don\u2019t see how the cork can be held in the order side of this genie for too much longer. There just appears to be the opportunity to be bursting at the seam. We have an excellent organization in China. I have compared to anyone else in the life science tools business, its top of the grade and its long service unlike a lot of organizations in China. So, it\u2019s been through the mill. And so, we are pretty optimistic, its business in these dynamics turns it all. We are going to be there to grab a hold of it, that\u2019s why we think this mid-single digit approach is more likely to offer us the opportunity to grow faster. The question is will it come earlier or later. So, it wouldn\u2019t surprise us if they were better than that, but it\u2019s awfully hard to bank on that at this point of time.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Perfect. That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thanks so much and get home safe guys.", "John Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question will come from Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Brokmeier", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Doug you stated earlier in the call that you expect the TA Division to up in 2015, but the fourth quarter looks like it was the weakest quarter of the year. Is that because of an easy comp next year that you expect pick up or new products that you plan to launch this year or is there something that you are seeing now that gives you the confidence that it will improve?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "I will let Gene\u2019s start and since Gene is very tied of this division. Gene, you want to\u2026", "Gene Cassis", "Sure, sure. I think that there is a confluence of activities happening this year that are going to work favorably for the TA Instruments group. If you look at the long-term growth rate of that business on the top line, it\u2019s been the solid high-single digit grower. Now, a component of that has been acquired businesses. And I think in 2015, what you are going to see is a nice delivery of some of the businesses that we have acquired more recently. We do have some new core products that will be coming to the market mid-year. So, we should have some second half of the year positive impact from those launches. And as you already mentioned, I think in comparison to prior year is this basic comparison affords us an opportunity to show some nice growth. I think that the pipeline looks excellent where both new products for the TA Instruments Division and as you begin to look at some of the customer dynamics, it looks like there is a lot of building interest in some of the newer product launches from that group that will begin to show their positive effects throughout this year.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "And as I said Bryan that, we can already see and I am normally reluctant to take January results to the bank and I\u2019m certainly not going to go hard at this, but already in the January timeframe, we are seeing very good strong indications of better performance coming.", "Bryan Brokmeier", "Okay. Thanks. And another question is, is the money you are spending on your health science initiatives and it\u2019s relatively immaterial or is it at the expense of investments in your core platforms or are you offsetting those investments with reductions in spending outside of R&D?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "It\u2019s not so much \u2013 well, first of all, independent of this decision, we continue to drive productivity programs. And so, we do that every year and we are doing it in 2015. So, we fully expect particularly in administrative and in science support areas to be able to grow our sales faster than we grow the support spending. With the health science initiative, independently, we looked at that and said while the payoff is not likely to be in 2015, the opportunity, the clear outsize opportunity that we have here means that we should spend faster to get there. And so, we made the decision to do that in our plan.", "We also have some initiatives probably three or four separate initiatives that we think will pay-off and added operating benefits. Anyone of which might not have happen, but taken in total, we think will contribute towards minimizing the overall P&L pain, not all of it, but it will mean that we can offset some of this increased spending. So that\u2019s probably the most I want to say about it. But it\u2019s \u2013 we are not trying to rob Peter to pay Paul.", "Bryan Brokmeier", "Alright. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is now open.", "Dan Arias", "Good afternoon guys. Thanks. Just one question for me, Doug or Gene in thinking about the margin runway, how do you guys see your ability for new product to be additive to gross margins. Just curious about the extent to which this happens and then whether that\u2019s something that you sort of aim for explicitly when you are thinking about adding products to the portfolio?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, it\u2019s interesting that typically when you have a new product launch the short-term impact until the volumes ramp is it has a little bit of a drag on gross margins. But I will take a look at some of the programs that we have introduced more recently in QDa and our new tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. I think we have done an excellent job in engineering these products to be accretive to the gross margin. So I mean it clearly is something that we are focused on especially for products where we know that there is a large market and you have a lot of initial market receptivity like the QDa, like our new tandem quadrupole. So and again we talked about this earlier in the call is the positive impact that our recurring revenues have on our gross margins and operating margins going forward and that\u2019s an important driver of our future profitability.", "John Lynch", "Operator, I have noticed the time and the conditions I think we could probably limit it to one more question.", "Operator", "Okay, great. Our next question will come from Jeff Elliott with Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff Elliott", "Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in and just one quick one here. Doug, when you look at the fourth quarter, what\u2019s your sense, was any of this revenue pulled ahead from the first quarter perhaps in the pharma side or were there any large orders in the academic side?", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Jeff, the clearest indication of a pull forward and I have \u2013 it\u2019s not often, but I can\u2019t say that in 20 plus years of doing this, I haven\u2019t seen some indications of major pull forwards. But I would say the clearest indication is that you see this big bolus of orders in the latter part of December and then you see orders fall off the cliff early on in January. Let me say that we clearly haven\u2019t seen that. I am certainly encouraged by the kind of early momentum that we have seen in 2015. So it\u2019s not a guarantee that it continues at a very high level, but I will say it\u2019s very indicative that we didn\u2019t empty the bucket in December.", "Jeff Elliott", "Excellent. Thank you.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Douglas Berthiaume", "Well, I want to thank you all. I appreciate you changing your schedules for this, who knows what the response would have been tomorrow. But we do appreciate it. And hopefully this is the last time we will have to change our schedule like this. We look forward to seeing you on a more rational schedule next quarter. Thanks again.", "John Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And with that, we will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. Well, good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation second quarter 2015 conference call. With me on today's call is Gene Cassis, the Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Water's Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations.", "And as is our custom, I will start with an overview of the business then Gene will follow with details of our financial results and an outlook for our business in the second half of this year. But before we start, I'd like Gene to cover the cautionary language.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for the third quarter and full-year 2015.", "We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For details, a discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, please see our 10-K Annual Report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.", "The next earning release call and webcast is currently planned for October of 2015.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release that we issued this morning. In our discussion of results of operations, we may refer to pro-forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted or non-GAAP financials, included again in this morning's press release.", "Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Gene. Well, the market dynamics that contributed to our strengths in the first quarter and largely continued through the second quarter of 2015 and resulted in a 10% growth rate in the quarter and 12% growth for the first half, both at constant currency. Looking at our operating divisions, the Waters Division constant currency sales grew at 11% while our TA division sales were up 2%. Currency translation reduced our overall constant currency sales growth by seven points in the quarter.", "Looking at the Waters Division and as we saw in the first quarter, the pharma business performed well in the second quarter, and sales were up 11% for this segment. As we've seen in recent quarters, the lion's share of our pharmaceutical health sciences growth came from smaller specialty and generic customers as well as from clinical labs. Our global chemical analysis business in the Waters Division, which includes food, environmental and industrial chemical markets, was up by the highest single-digit rate in the quarter.", "Geographically for the Waters Division, sales in the U.S. were up 10% with strong pharmaceutical and industrial chemical demand, with slower shipments in governmental and academic markets.", "Sales growth in Europe for the division at constant currency was up 5%, with weakness in Eastern Europe offsetting stronger pharmaceutical life sciences and industrial chemical results in the Western Europe markets.", "We turn to Asia, sales in China, which, as you know, is our largest Asian market were up at a strong double-digit rate with sales to government and academic labs augmenting a continuing trend of strong growth from private sector labs. This marks the third quarter in a row of a very strong sales growth in China. Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan were up 5% in the quarter with strong shipments to government and university customers as well as an increase in demand from chemical materials end markets.", "In India, Waters Division sales were up at a strong double-digit rate too. The quarter's growth in India was primarily associated with higher instrument software and service sales to the generic drug industry. During the second half of this year and starting in the third quarter, prior year sales comparisons will become a lot more challenging in India for us.", "And I noted earlier, TA Instruments are 2% increase in sales in the quarter at constant currency, which was over a very strong prior year's results. Through the first half of 2015, constant currency sales growth at TA stands at 7%. In the quarter, TA acquired assets related to the ElectroForce Group from Bose Corporation, and the ElectroForce Group designs and manufactures dynamic mechanical testing systems based on a proprietary electromagnetic motor technology.", "Now I'd like to discuss some product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters Division in the quarter. The division's recurring revenues, the combination of service and consumables, grew at 9%. Consumables growth at 9% benefited from strong uptake of ACQUITY UPLC column offerings. In addition, we introduced and begin shipping a new sample prep chemistry called Oasis PRiME HLB, and this next-generation solid-phase extraction product will improve and accelerate workflows across a wide range of applications that require high sensitivity and reproducible LC and LC/MS analysis.", "The Waters Division service business also performed very well in the quarter, also growing at 9%. The strength in the service business was geographically balanced and correlated to the general strength that we saw in our pharmaceutical end market.", "Waters Division instrument system sales grew at a strong 13% in the second quarter. This growth was highlighted by continued strong uptake of LC/MS systems that features Xevo tandem quadrupole technology and our ACQUITY QDa mass detector.", "LC systems growth for both ACQUITY and Alliance platforms was driven by demand from pharmaceutical customers in the U.S. and India and generally strong demand in China. Our recently initiated agreement with PerkinElmer Corporation also positively contributed to our LC component shipments.", "If you look at our new product introductions, we had a very busy quarter at this year's ASMS Conference in St. Louis. We launched the Vion IMS QTof mass spectrometer and our REIMS Research System with iKnife Sampling.", "Our new Vion IMS system combines the benefits of high resolution tandem MS analysis and ion mobility separation in a bench top configuration. By adding IM mobility capability, this instrument generates cleaner spectrum by removing interferences and provides collision cross section values for ions of interest. These capabilities allow for new levels of sensitivity and resolution for researchers in applications that range from complex screening studies to metabolite ID and more classical OMEX experiments.", "The REIMS Research System with iKnife Sampling drew quite a bit of interest at ASMS. A key feature of this system is the speed with which a researcher can determine chemical and biochemical differences and complex samples without the need for sample prep or a chromatographic separation. REIMS or, as it's known, Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry, is the technology that we acquired last year with our purchase of assets from MediMass. REIMS technology, in combination with capabilities in DESI and MALDI further extends our portfolio of surface ionization technologies.", "During our April earnings call, while discussing our health science initiative, I explained how the combination of DESI and MALDI ion sources, embodied in our full spectrum molecular imaging system, provides actionable information about the specific location of molecules on tissue surfaces. With our new REIMS capability, it's the speed of analysis that is advantageous. Researchers now can, for example, quickly determine fraud in food labeling or easily check for food adulteration by simply applying the ionize to a specimen surface.", "Staying on the new product launches, in June, we introduced and began taking orders for our ACQUITY Arc system. The ACQUITY Arc system is a modern platform, modular LC system, designed to bridge the performance capabilities of HPLC and UPLC systems, and facilitate method validation for improved workflows in labs running regulated legacy HPLC protocols.", "So in summarizing the quarter's performance, I will point out that our top-line growth indicates a continuation of recent business momentum. We were very active on the new product introduction front, and we managed our expenses carefully to generate strong operating results.", "And before turning you over to Gene, I'd like to say a few words about our planned leadership transition. On June 25, we announced that the Waters' board of directors appointed Christopher J. O'Connell as Waters' new President, CEO and member of its board of directors. Chris comes to Waters from Medtronic, where he worked for 21 years, and where he served most recently as the President of their Restorative Therapies Group. This is a business with $7 billion in annual revenues and more than 16,000 employees.", "Chris' appointment was the successful conclusion of a global search process that, as you know, spanned approximately two years and that surfaced a number of very qualified individuals. We were looking for a new leader who could successfully continue Waters' proven and focused business strategy while creatively looking for ways to successfully pursue new opportunities to further grow our business and create shareholder value.", "In Chris, we feel that he meets these requirements and actually so much more. The much more comes from the important fit that Chris' demonstrated management style and engaging personality have with Waters' established business culture, a culture that strongly focuses on customer needs, advanced technology development, and financial discipline. Chris will be assuming his new responsibilities in early September, and I feel confident that Waters will continue to prosper under his leadership.", "But getting back to discussing our business, I'm very pleased with our overall business results in the first half of this year. For the first six months, we have grown our diluted earnings per share by 18%, even with a stronger-than-expected currency headwind. And in looking at the P&L, as well as the balance sheet so far this year, I feel that we're well positioned to deliver a full-year performance that's better than our original expectations, all while continuing to invest in our long-term growth strategies and while generating strong free cash flow.", "Well, after about 20 years of hosting these quarterly conference calls, it does seem a bit strange to acknowledge that this is my last opportunity to address you in my current role. I want to personally thank our shareholders for their support over the years, and for their valuable insights that have helped us fine-tune our business plans. I also want to acknowledge the efforts of the analysts who have covered, and continue to follow and report on Waters. Over the years, they've made great efforts to understand our business and explain our products, technologies and end markets to potential investors.", "But most of all, I'd like to thank the employees of Waters for all the hard work and creativity that they have put into making our business such a success. I think therein lies the true Waters difference.", "And now I'd like to turn it over to Gene for a more detailed review of our financials.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning. At $495 million, our second quarter revenues increased 10% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth in the quarter by 7%, resulting in 3% reported sales growth. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 8% to $1.32, in comparison to earnings of $1.22 last year. On a GAPP basis, our earnings were $1.27 versus $1.13 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release that we issued this morning.", "Looking at our growth geographically, and before foreign currency effects: U.S. sales were up 7%, Europe was up 5%, Japan also was up 5%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 26%, with strong demand in India and China. On the product front, and again in constant currency within the Waters Division, instrument system sales increased by 13%, and our recurring revenues grew by 9%. In all, the Waters Division sales were up 11%. For our TA Instruments Division, constant currency sales increased by 2%.", "Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins came in at about 58%, consistent with the second quarter of the prior year. Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 1% on a constant currency basis. The impact of currency translation reduced SG&A by 8%. R&D expenses increased by 18% in constant currency, due to ongoing spending associated with new product development and incremental investments related to our health science initiative. The impact of currency translation reduced R&D expenses by 5%.", "On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.6%. For the full year 2015, we expect our operating tax rate to be around 14%; and in this projection, we have not assumed a re-establishment of the U.S. R&D tax credit.", "In the quarter, net interest expense was up $7 million, and our average share count came in at 83.3 million shares, or approximately 1.8 million shares lower than in the second quarter last year, a net result of our share repurchase program.", "Turning to the balance sheet: Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.2 billion and debt totaled $1.6 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $648 million. Regarding our debt, in the second quarter we amended our bank credit agreement, extending the maturity date to 2020 and increasing our borrowing facility by $200 million, from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.", "As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 605,000 shares of our common stock for $80 million. This leaves $604 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase programs.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the second quarter of 2015, free cash flow came in at $96 million after funding $24 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from this amount is approximately $4 million of investments associated with major facility expansion. This brings our year-to-date 2015 free cash flow to $234 million, as compared to $218 million for the first half of 2014.", "Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 75 days this quarter, a decrease of one day from second quarter in the prior year. In the quarter, inventories increased by $15 million as compared to the end of first quarter of 2015, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern.", "Now I will discuss our 2015 full-year outlook. For the second half of 2015, we generally anticipate that the drivers of our sales growth in the first half will continue. However, the combination of more challenging quarterly comparisons and fewer selling days in the fourth quarter will likely moderate our second half organic sales growth rate. With these dynamics in play, we now expect to finish the year with 7% to 8% constant currency sales growth. Currency translation for the full year and assuming current exchange rates will reduce our reported sales growth by approximately 6%.", "Moving down the P&L, gross margins are expected to come in close to 59% and potentially a little bit better than they did in 2014. We expect to manage our constant currency overall operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant currency sales growth rate. However, we anticipate that R&D expenses will continue to grow at a higher rate due to ongoing new product development efforts and incremental spending associated with our health science initiative.", "Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million. Turning to share count, our full-year average diluted share count is expected to be reduced to around 83 million shares as a result of continued share repurchases.", "Rolling all of this together, full-year 2015 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are now expected to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.90. As we think about our expectations for the third quarter of 2015, our guidance anticipates constant currency sales growth to come in at about 7%. Currency translation in the quarter is expected to reduce our reported sales growth rate by approximately 7%. This top-line performance is expected to result in non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share within a range $1.33 to $1.43 in the third quarter.", "Doug?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Gene. And at this point, operator, I think we can turn it over to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment please for our first question. First question is from Mr. Jon Groberg of UBS. Sir, your line is open. Mr. Groberg, your line is open.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Is there anyone there, operator?", "Operator", "Yes. We have Mr. Jon Groberg on queue, sir. However, we might have lost him.

(27:10)", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "No, (27:11) you guys are back.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "There's no sound on the line now.", "Operator", "Okay.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "The echo seems to have been gone.", "Unknown Speaker", "Yeah.", "Operator", "All right. Proceeding to the next question from Mr. Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Sir, your line is open.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Doug, are you there?", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Can you guys hear me all right?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know what went wrong with that line, but I guess we're all back.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "I haven't heard somebody say my name so frequently since I was probably like 10 years old. It was a little scary. But Doug, I wanted to start by saying you will be missed, and we do hope to see you around town. Very good job over many years, strong execution, great leadership. Again, you will be missed.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "(28:06) Thanks.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Maybe just to start with China, it's clearly been a period for the last few quarters where you've done quite well. Is it possible to help us a bit more in deconstructing how much of this is the favorable comparison versus fundamental improvement? I guess what I'm thinking about is would you be able to walk us through sales and ordering patterns in, say, Q2 versus Q1 and Q4? And more specifically, would you be willing to share what growth assumption is factored into full-year revenue growth for China?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me take the first part of it and Gene can take over the second part. Clearly, we did have a tough three or four quarters in China. We always thought that that with us was a bit more related to banking oversight. We continued to see, what I call, the underlying dynamics remaining strong; the number of quotes, the number of major projects that the customers were initiating. We're still staying at that very strong pace, but you couldn't get those customers to let the orders because they couldn't in any way confirm that the money was going to be there in the end.", "So, I would say that was a pretty strong dynamic in terms of the weakness that we saw a year, year-and-a-half ago. We're, I'd say, substantially out of that period. You're never out of it totally, and you can always see this little blips in terms of tightening down on the available banking resources. But I'd say that's why we're perhaps more confident that we have never seen the underlying demand fade. We've continued to see it strong.", "The other dynamic I think, Doug, is we've continued to see strong and building, what I call, expat business in China. So, we have a very strong business with American and West European companies that are continuing to expand to that domestic market. That has not fallen off. It's the less than 50% of our business that comes through government's sponsored activity in China, that's what went through a somewhat down cycle, I think, principally related to this banking tightening, and we've seen that leven (31:02) off.", "So, I think there's no question that some of the absolute strength that we're seeing is related to the fact that it was a relatively easy comparison. But I still think we're pretty confident about good strong conditions in China as we go forward.", "Gene, you want to embroider (31:21) on that?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Doug, as you look at the prior year results, we did begin to see the business ramp in China during the second half of 2014. And that ramp resulted in a double-digit growth in sales in the fourth quarter. So, as we look at the basis of comparison for this year, the basis for comparison does become a little bit more challenging in the fourth quarter. And what we see right now in terms of indicators of strength suggests to us that underlying demand has strengthened. Orders and sales were both up double digit in the quarter that we're reporting on now.", "And, but we do expect that as we get into the later part of the year that the sales, the year-over-year sales growth will diminish a bit because of the improved \u2013 because of the more difficult base of comparison. Now having said that, and if I think about the guidance that we've given for the full year, what we do anticipate that growth rate in China will be closer to the low double-digit through the second half of the year.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's really helpful. And then just a couple of clean-ups and I'll get back in the queue. Did the PKI deal impact sales in the quarter or is that mainly just orders? Based on your wording in your prepared remarks, it sounded like it was probably the latter. And then, the other question is just on book-to-bill. I don't believe you provided it. It sounded like orders were as strong as sales, but given the strength of instruments in the quarter I just wanted to see if there was anything of note there. Thank you.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. No. Just in terms of looking at backlog build in the quarter, orders and sales were approximately the same in the quarter, so there was no meaningful difference there. As we take a look at the PKI, I mean, what we talked \u2013 what we're \u2013 on the quarter that we just reported on, we did see orders and sales in that partnership and the trajectory that we're on gives us confidence in the original projection that we had for the full year and that is that the incremental benefit of this partnership will result in about 1 point to 100 basis point improvement for Waters' shipments this year.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.", "Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, guys. So, Doug, I looked it up; since 1996, you've outperformed the S&P by 2400% -- not a bad showing, I guess. So you can leave quite happy. I guess as we look at the macro, industrial markets most of the indicators are kind of pointing south and then your business tends to be more insulated.", "As we progress into the third quarter, particularly, on the equipment side, just because you've had such strong instrument sales, any areas where you'd point to a little bit of softening, you don't have a kind of basic industrial exposure, maybe on the chemical side where there's a little bit of caution? I mean, I wouldn't think it's playing in any of the traditional healthcare markets, and it seems like the emerging markets are fine.", "So, I'm just trying to figure out if there's anything that's maybe a little bit at the margin trending, maybe downwards since everything sort of seems like it's quite strong.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Ross, I think you can point to the quarter that we just had. The business most affected by the industrial \u2013 the classic industrial market is the TA business. And TA had low single-digit growth. But for the half, TA was up 7% organically. And so, yeah, I think you might see a little bit in the classic industrial chemical, the DuPonts and the Dows of the world probably seeing a little bit of weakness there.", "For the Waters Division, though, the industrial category \u2013 in our world that includes environmental labs, the food and beverage, food safety \u2013 and the conditions there are pretty robust. So, I'd say, on the margin maybe you're seeing a little bit of a struggle in some of those industrial accounts. But even at TA, I think it's more that we're in the tail end of their product cycle. You're going to see really an uptick in their new products next year. And yet, their organic growth is still hanging in there. I don't think there's any share loss there. So, it's a marginal thing. I don't think it's anything significant to be worried about.", "Gene, do you...", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "No. No. I think that's well said.", "Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI", "Obviously, Doug, you're leaving the business in tremendous shape. It's having some of its best run on the new product side in some time. It feels like one of the last things from an end-market perspective you've focused on was sort of the diagnostic opportunity you've talked about the last few calls. I guess, where do you see that going for the business? Are you happy with the progress you're making? Do you feel like some of the skill set of the incoming CEO will play well to that market, just given his background? I'm just trying to get a sense for, do you feel like that piece takes Waters to kind of the next level over the next 10 or 15 years?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's insightful that we clearly have talked a lot about this broad health science initiative. But I think it's best for us to think about it in that context, that it isn't a diagnostic opportunity; it's really looking at almost the soup-to-nuts opportunity, as we work with some of these very large integrated healthcare systems and research centers that are making large investments on both the basic research side, the translational medicine side, then on the therapeutic and the diagnostic side.", "So, I think what it's worthwhile to think about is that, we're looking at a broad range of products and technologies that are coming to bear in all of those fronts. And if we're successful, we'll see that working on the front-end with these thought leaders leads to opportunities in that whole string of downstream health science opportunities.", "We see that probably right now more in the first couple of phases in that, in the basic science and the beginning of translational medicine, in the big academic medical centers, both here and in Europe. The diagnostic opportunities that have been very robust have been in areas like pain management, where there are \u2013 seems to be growing by leaps and bounds.", "So, there's no question that Chris O'Connell has superior insight into that whole marketplace from a different technology point of view. But just recently, we secured a significant order in the OMIX area in Europe, and it turns out Chris O'Connell has a very intimate relationship with the leader of that institution. So, we're finding more and more the overlap and the connection, the geographic knowledge, that Chris has in the application universe. So, we're very happy with the way that's all coming together. That help?", "Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI", "Thank you so much, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Dan Leonard of Leerink. Sir, your line is open.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Hi. I guess to the high level, I'm curious in the EPS guidance revision, why it wasn't a little bit higher, given the big uptick in your organic revenue growth guidance?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You want to take that?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Let me make sure I got your question, Dan. Your question is about the guidance?", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Yeah. You took EPS guidance up at the midpoint by a percent, yet revenue guidance was up at a much healthier clip, from mid-single digits to 7% to 8% for the full year.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, yeah, I mean, we -", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "So, I'm wondering what's going on.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "We talked about the full year at 7% to 8%, and the guidance before was mid-single digit. I think that we fully recognized that a lot of the growth that we've enjoyed, especially in the last quarter, is from \u2013 Asia was a significant driver of that growth, and we know that the bases of comparison become a little bit more challenging in the second half. And we had very strong first quarter. And in part, we benefited from three extra selling days in that quarter, and that becomes a headwind for us in the fourth quarter, where we have fewer selling days.", "So, I think that, as you begin to look at those two factors, and still understand that the fourth quarter is a little bit a ways off, and it probably makes sense to, if anything, err a little bit on the conservative side. I think we're very comfortable with the top line and the bottom line. I'd just like to mention that the bottom line, the EPS guidance that we provided, also factors in a little bit more headwind from currency than we had anticipated the last time we gave guidance.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, how meaningful are areas like pain management, therapeutic drug monitoring more broadly, and drugs of abuse testing? How meaningful is that as part of your business, because it seems like that's an area that's coming under increasing reimbursement scrutiny in the U.S.?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's a growing part of our business. It's \u2013 right now, the whole health sciences area of our business is not quite 10%.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, it's fair to put that into that context, and pain management is a piece of that. I'd say the pain management piece and therapeutic drug monitoring, all-in, is a significant part of that health science initiative in the United States, and it's a growing piece outside of the United States \u2013 not a big piece of Asia, but a growing piece in Western Europe.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. That's helpful context. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Sir, your line is open.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Good morning. I kind of want to make an echo joke, but I guess I'll hold off here. Two questions for you: first, just regarding the strong pharma demand that you've seen in the past couple of quarters, I was just wondering if you could comment on where you're seeing that come from. Is it more \u2013 do you see more coming from replacement demand or new system placements? Because I'm trying to just gauge how much \u2013 what the legs look like for this type of strong growth from pharma, and then I have a follow-up?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well Steve, it's interesting, because the growth is not coming from our classical big pharma accounts. Those accounts are low-single digit to flat. So, most of our growth is coming from specialty pharma, generics, big and small biotech accounts. And I'd say most of that is new initiatives, the volume-based. It's not significant. You always have some replacement and maintenance business that goes on \u2013 and throughout that. But I'd say the prime initiative here is more forward-looking spending.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "And the one thing that I would add, Steve, is that the recurring revenues, the service and the chemistry business that we have, is disproportionately weighted to the pharmaceutical side of our business because of the number of samples that are running in applications like quality control. So, what we're seeing in terms of strong demand on the chemistry side and on the service side is indicative of high utilization rates of instruments in the installed base, and that's very encouraging. That shows you that there's an underlying demand based on the requirement to one run more samples that I think does have legs to it.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Very good. Thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up to, I believe with Dan's earlier question, Gene, I think last quarter, you were assuming roughly $0.43 of an impact from FX in your guidance. You alluded to a slightly larger FX impact, and just was wondering if you could quantify what your assumption is now for the EPS impact from FX in the full-year guidance?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I think if we look over the year-over-year comparison, we had about a $0.13 impact of \u2013 from FX in the second quarter and about $0.21 for the first half of the year. The guidance that we gave assumes another $0.13 in the third quarter and probably something closer to the first quarter of impact in the fourth quarter as we begin to anniversary some of those strengthening \u2013 I'm sorry, weakening of foreign currencies.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Jon Groberg of UBS. Sir, your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Can you hear me this time?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. I hope I don't break the phone system again.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Be careful, Jon.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "So, first of all, Doug, let me offer my congratulations as well, and good luck with what comes next for you. And I'm sure we'll continue to hear from \u2013 from all the good things that you're doing. So, I just, one, wanted to clarify on the health sciences, I think you said, so clinical, translational \u2013 however guys define that, you're saying it's just under 10% of sales. How fast is that growing currently?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's pretty much -", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "It's in double digit.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think we're comfortable with saying it's a good double-digit grower currently.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, Doug, I guess, maybe two questions on just the leadership transition that I think are relevant. I mean, one, what do you think that your employees are going to be most excited about when it comes to Chris joining the team? And two, you have to look out there, as I'm sure you do, and there's been some pretty hefty multiples paid in the space for, what I would call, trophy assets and especially those that have some good long-term growth drivers like in the biopharma space, and given your position in that space, I'd put you in that category. So, I guess, how did you think about \u2013 how did you think about whether or not the right move was not to explore maybe another value creative opportunity as opposed to moving forward with the plan that you did from a CEO standpoint?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "All right, Jon. Let me take them in reverse order. You've followed us for as long as anybody and you know that from time immemorial, people have talked about Waters could be acquired by someone else and fit into their portfolio. And we've always pretty much ignored that talk and focused on what was right for our business and our customers.", "And from the point a view of our board and our management team, there was \u2013 we never believed and still don't believe that there's anything that a bigger, larger, more diversified company brings to us that would help us as opposed to continuing to pursue these initiatives on our own. So, from our perspective, we can well imagine why somebody might drool over the opportunity of adding Waters to their portfolio. It didn't do much for our strategic advantages.", "So, you can say, okay, but at some price, any company can be acquired. We all know that. So, I can tell you that no one has seriously tempted us along those lines. So, I think you can never say what'll happen in the future. But I and the board believe that the future for Waters is incredibly bright. You probably know that I never think our stock is fairly valued. I think it's always undervalued. And so, the opportunities to prove that \u2013 when we were trading under $100, people thought we were maybe as far as we could go. And when we're at $130, who knows \u2013 people probably think the same thing.", "But I look at our opportunities. I look at what we can grow over the next three, five years, and I think our shareholders are going to be very fairly rewarded by continuing down this path. And I don't think you have to look too far at the companies who have been acquired over the last three or four years. I mean, I'm going back to Millipore. When the body of politics thought that they got such a great price for their business, you look at the market today and if they had held on there as individual companies, they'd be trading at much higher prices than they settled for in the acquisition world.", "I don't think you have to look too far to some of those companies that still haven't closed yet to say, gee, I wonder what their future was as stand-alone businesses rather than settling for what looked to be a strong premium. So, I'll get off my soapbox, but I don't see anything that's likely to change our perspective in the near term absent somebody just deciding to really open their purse strings. And having said that, now I forget about your first part of the question.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "That was really helpful. The first part was what do you think, because again, Chris, coming kind of from the outside, doesn't really have a lot of exposure to even investors as we've spoken to those who've known Medtronic for a while, so just kind of what do you think employees or maybe investors are going to most appreciate about Chris?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think it's interesting because in going through the gamut of the recruitment process, Chris talked to, certainly, first, me, and then the succession planning committee and the search firm and the rest of the board, and then the rest of the senior management group. Never had I imagined it would be so universally positive about the credentials of somebody coming into this job particularly as we all know the incumbent is so highly valued.", "So, Chris did an outstanding job of selling himself to the organization. And starting out, Chris had no real appreciation for Waters or our background and history. Since we made the decision, Chris has had the opportunity to broaden that association. We've gone down a level or two in the organization, had some dinners. And the organization has been kind of universal in their initial reaction that Chris seems to be a Waters' cultural fit.", "And, look, you do the best you can, and I'm sure Chris has done the best he could. He clearly has knowledge of this whole healthcare environment, he's well-traveled, he understands the Asian markets from the perspective of Medtronic. But that perspective isn't that different from our perspective. So, I'm sure Chris isn't going to be a Doug Berthiaume clone. I don't want him to be. The company doesn't want him to be. He'll bring his own expertise and his own desires and strategic abilities.", "But I think he clearly, to the best of our ability and his, conforms to what we think the initial perspective of the CEO of Waters is going to be. He values the same kinds of things. He brings the same cultural values to the table. And I just think he's going to be a great fit.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks, Doug. Congrats again.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.", "Joel H. Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, guys. Thanks. It's actually Joel Kaufman in for Isaac. Just taking it back to the pharma end markets, could you maybe parse out the growth rates year-to-date in QA/QC versus what you're seeing in R&D?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's been balanced, Joel, but the one thing is that we've had a very growth in India. I think you've heard that in the first quarter call as in the second quarter call. And the growth there is generic pharmaceutical demand and it's mostly quality control related. But as you begin to look across our pharmaceutical end market and begin to segment our business out by small molecule applications, large molecule applications, it's been very balanced actually.", "But QDa has been a wonderful product in terms of helping us in the small molecule world, and for people who have been primarily and only focused on looking at what's happening on the large molecule front. This brings us back to a reality that small molecules continue to be important, and we're seeing that with our QDa demand. So, I'd say that if you factor out the exceptional growth that we've seen in India during the first half and then begin to look at the pharmaceutical demand, it's pretty \u2013 it's been pretty balanced across the whole spectrum starting from discovery through QA/QC.", "Joel H. Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Then just a follow-up in Japan, I think you guys grew there low-single digits in the first half of the year. Could you just maybe provide your expectations for the back half and maybe how the comps shape up in the back half of the year?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. On Japan, yeah, our expectation is that the results that we've seen year-to-date are probably indicative of what the results will look like for the full year. There's been some interesting dynamics in Japan in that you had an interesting year last year in terms of looking at governmental spending. You had a favorable comp on governmental spending, so it looked optically very strong in the quarter that we just reported. We had a strong pharmaceutical first half of 2014, though a little bit softer. But I don't think it's indicative of a change in demand as it is to just some of the details of the basis of comparison.", "In general, we're expecting the performance that we've seen in the first half of the year to continue through the second half of the year.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I think, in general, we think of Japan as being a mid-single-digit grower. It can bounce around the mid-single digits. But I think our long-term expectations revolve around that expectation.", "Joel H. Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Matt Mishan of KeyBanc. Sir, your line is open.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "I'm sorry. We didn't hear the name.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Matt Mishan.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Matt?", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "KeyBanc. Yep.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks, Gene. Hey, Doug. Just hearing your thoughts on the value of companies taking out that you think would be like greater in the marketplace maybe as like stand-alone a couple years later. Does that make you more interested in being an acquirer?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Not particularly. Depends \u2013 but it all depends on the assets, Matt. I still \u2013 my general rule of thumb that some people debate and some agree with is that we're perfectly willing to consider adding to our portfolio as long as it's in an area that we think we know something about, that we can manage and it doesn't dilute the existing business. I just don't \u2013 when we think that we have the opportunity to grow in the high-single digits organically, that buying something that dilutes that for the short-term pleasure of cutting out administrative costs doesn't appeal to us. It does to some, but in the end you're going to look at those serial acquirers and say, gee, where's the evidence that adding assets to them took their 2% or 3% organic growth rate and doubled it or tripled it.", "And as you know, it's hard to find great evidence of that. It's not hard to find evidence that they can cut costs for some period of time and grow their earnings in a very-low-interest-rate environment. And who knows, maybe that'll turn out to be the wisest business strategy that we've ever seen. But it's not something that has ever particularly appealed to me. And so I think, as long as we see the opportunity to continue to do what we do and deliver superior results, we think it's the better strategy.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then, can you remind us of your NIH exposure and any thoughts you have on some of the legislation making its way through Congress? And also, with some of your newer products, you think you can punch above your weight a little bit if that legislation goes through?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think the NIH opportunity is very marginally, potentially positive to us, but Gene will tell you why. Gene?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I think our exposure is \u2013 roughly 1% of our sales are related to that spend level, and it's heavily weighted towards our higher end mass spectrometry product. So, it tends to be a relatively small percentage of our business, and it tends to be somewhat lumpy, just given the high ASPs.", "So, as Doug said, it's a \u2013 it's likely to be a marginal positive. We're encouraged that some of the technologies that we've introduced during the first half of this year, as we move into what is historically \u2013 third quarter is usually a bigger quarter for U.S. governmental spending. We think we have a pretty good pipeline of customers that are interested in some of our more recently introduced technologies.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you, and great quarter.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Hi. Can you hear me?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Can you hear me? Oh, great. Doug, congratulations. It's been \u2013 covering the stock since 2001, so it's been a pleasure working with you. Two real quick questions: First, how should we think about R&D spending going forward? Do you think \u2013 should we model it higher than constant currency growth rates in the out years? And what is the overall impact for M&A for the full year in constant currency growth? Thank you very much.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think, clearly, this year is going to see a spike in R&D growth compared to what's happened historically. And that's specifically related to the health science initiative and things like REIMS and DESI. You're likely to see another year of higher-than-average R&D growth, but I don't see that extending deeply into the future. It's not going to mitigate in the next couple of quarters. But we don't see \u2013 we see a number of initiatives, that are going on right now, that will keep that tail rising.", "Now, having said that, down the road we could initiative something else and have to rationalize it and incorporate it into the budget. But with our current momentum, I'd say, yeah, 2016 is likely to see a somewhat higher R&D rate. But I think then it begins to mitigate.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And the M&A impact for this year?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I think the question, Derik, was the impact of M&A for this year?", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Thanks, Gene.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "2015, we expect that M&A will be a very small part of the growth story, maybe we're looking at 20 or 25 basis points.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ms. Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Ma'am, your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Anthony (1:04:33) in for Amanda. Just a couple of quick questions: First, you guys have definitely had a number of new product launches this year. Would you be able to add a little bit of insight, or maybe some more specifics, regarding the potential growth impact for this year and potentially next year as well, regarding these new product launches?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "I think your question, if I could just rephrase it to make sure we heard it correctly, was that you're trying to understand the impact of new product launches on this year and next year? Is that...?", "Unknown Speaker", "Correct. Yeah, primarily on revenue, correct.", "Unknown Speaker", "Corrrect.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, if you look at our full-year, high-single-digit growth rate expectations, certainly in the Waters division, the \u2013 I'd say it's kind of a classical year, in terms of the effect of new products versus continuing new products. If you just look at the products launched this year, you're talking principally, so far, products in the mass spec arena. Of course, you have things like the QDa that were launched previously that is still in the early phase of the cycle.", "So, I would say that we're in a representative year. It was a strong launch of capabilities, but it's \u2013 I'm not prepared to say precisely what the new product effect was.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think, as you look at the growth rate that we're enjoying this year, there's clearly a positive market dynamic. Over the years we've been a pretty good proxy for the strength in health sciences and pharmaceuticals. And I think what you're hearing from us, as you've heard from some other companies in our space, is that's a healthy market. And I think we are getting at least our just share of that market health.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "And there's no new product introduction that stands out as dramatically affecting this growth rate. Let's say you've seen products across the consumables space with the glyco product and the mass spec triple quad area has been healthy, the single quad with the QDa. It's pretty broad based. (1:07:34)", "Unknown Speaker", "Well, if I could just ask one additional follow-up on that. You guys definitely touched on China and on India, and how the strength is \u2013 or the growth has been incredibly strong. Would you be able to elaborate, actually, a little bit more specially on India? Is it \u2013 and I guess like, even in terms of \u2013 not just revenue, but even on the expense side. I know that you mentioned that with SG&A, you're expecting \u2013 well, I guess that is more my question, in terms of, what would be the potential impact on SG&A as you continue to expand in India?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if I understand the question, our India business is a very well-run business. So if you look at its level of profitability, it's certainly very well run and above-average level of operating profits. And what's happened in India in the last couple of years is they ran through a period of very weak currency, a kind of political uncertainty and in the past \u2013 and a period when a number of generic drug manufacturers ran into regulatory issues, some of them quite serious.", "And in the past 12 months, the result of trying to cure those regulatory issues has been that they've turned to us for significant help in both the software area, the service area or qualifying their instruments and doing extra work. We still see the effect of that currently. We also see an improvement in the political environment and a somewhat stabilizing of the rupee.", "So, all of those things have kind of moved positively. I'd say, again, we have a very strong position in India. I think they're coming out of a period when those generic drug manufacturers were kind of treading water in terms of their capacity. And we're pretty optimistic about their long-term business plans to add to capacity and capabilities.", "So, l'd say, while, yes, we've come through a period where we had pretty soft businesses, so easy comparisons, I think we're going to through a period when the underlying demand is still pretty strong and the profitability of this business is very good. So, I think...", "Unknown Speaker", "Well. Excellent. Thank you for the detail, guys. And once again, congratulations on a great quarter. Thank you.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. And operator, I think we can take one more to make up for our echo start, but we're well passed the 9:30 difficult stopping date. So, I think one more would be appropriate.", "Operator", "Okay. Our last question is from Ms. Miro Minkova of Stifel. Ma'am, your line is open.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on your retirement, Doug. Let me start with just the guidance for the fourth quarter. Considering that it's still kind of early on, and you probably don't have a great visibility on the pipeline, but you are implying like basically flat revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Gene, maybe remind us, how many fewer selling days you have and what is the breakdown between the fewer selling days, the tougher comps in India, China and the balance between the underlying demand that you're seeing?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. So, Miroslava -", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the selling days \u2013 go ahead, Gene.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. There's three fewer selling days in the fourth quarter -", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Compared to the fourth quarter last year.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "...quarter of last year. And typically, Miroslava, those affect most dramatically the recurring revenues. So, then the recurring revenues are roughly half of our business. If I take a look at what's the positive effect was of a similar \u2013 of selling days moving in the other direction in the first quarter, it was probably 2% or 3% points on the 15% total growth that we had in the first quarter. So, as you begin to take a look what the assumptions are for the rest of the year, we talked about the third quarter having a top-line growth rate of 7%, and the full-year guidance pretty much assumes a 3% or 4% growth rate in the fourth quarter.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks very much for the color. And maybe if I could ask you on the ionize \u2013 the REIMS product that you unveiled at ASMS, just curious as to if you gotten any earlier \u2013 any early feedback from potential clients on the reception of the food testing application? And how \u2013 any expectation for this product for the next 12 to 18 months?", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'd say the initial reaction to the food tasting \u2013 the food safety application is very positive. But I would caution you to say that we're still in the early phases of putting that technology in the hands of these customers. And as you know, the applications there widely vary. So, whether you're talking about milk products or you're talking about meat products, you're typically talking about different situations with different customers.", "But I would say rarely have we seen an initial level of interest with the ionized applications in food safety. It's a very strong. But you're not seeing that currently in our order rate. We do think that that's coming.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much for your time today.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you all for both taking the time today and over the years. I do appreciate your jobs and how you've done it and how you've treated me and Waters over the years. So, I'll look forward to you being just as insightful and kind in your treatment of Waters over the next 20 years. Thanks again and I look forward to hearing about it.

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "John Lynch - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for the fourth quarter and full year 2015.", "We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for January 2016.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP financials, included again in this morning's press release.", "Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which at this time generally adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.", "Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Waters' new Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell, as he participates on his first Waters quarterly earnings call. Chris?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.", "I am thrilled to be at Waters and look forward to sharing my transition goals and some of my early experiences and observations. But since my first priority is to ensure strong quarterly operating results, I would like to start by reviewing Waters' third quarter performance.", "I am pleased to report that Q3 was another strong quarter where our employees around the world executed and delivered positive results. Overall revenues were up 9% in the third quarter, a growth rate that demonstrates the continued strong business momentum we have seen throughout 2015; and through the first nine months of 2015, revenues were up 11%. Our robust growth was led by strong demand for Waters Division core products and services in the broad-based life science sector.", "As we have seen in recent quarters, our pharmaceutical growth came from smaller specialty and generic customers as well as from clinical labs. As I will detail in a few minutes, we also benefited from balanced geographical growth with particular strength in the U.S., Europe, India, and China.", "Now let's dive deeper by taking a look at the Waters Division performance. Revenues for the Waters Division were up 9%, with sales to our broadly defined global pharmaceuticals segment up 10% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Globally, government and academic business was flat in the quarter against a strong performance in 2014, with strong growth in the U.S. offsetting declines in certain emerging markets. Sales to the food, environmental, and industrial chemical markets also performed well in the quarter, growing at a mid-teens rate.", "From a product line standpoint, our (4:45) platform sales grew at a 10% rate in the quarter, including meaningful contributions from both the ACQUITY and Alliance families. Demand was strongest for our benchtop LC and LC-MS instruments used in broad-based life science applications. The strong demand for LC-MS instruments, including our ACQUITY QDa Detector, demonstrates the impact of our goal to expand the adoption of mass spectrometry to the larger liquid chromatography market. Growth for high-resolution mass spectrometry in the quarter was challenged by tough comparisons to prior-year. Looking forward, we are seeing building interest for our new Vion IMS QTof platform, introduced at this year's ASMS Conference.", "Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 8% in the quarter. Waters Service business was generally strong across all major geographies, with contracted service plan revenue driving much of the growth.", "On the chemistry front, the column portion of our broader chemistry business benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. The continued growth of Waters ACQUITY installed base is an increasingly meaningful driver of growth for our chemistry product lines as we garner high attachment rates with our UPLC platforms. We will continue to (6:05) offerings to maintain our competitive edge and fuel our growth.", "Staying within the Waters Division, I now want to cover performance from a geographic (6:14) in comparison to the (6:19) performance in the prior year. Growth was generally strong across most end markets, with pharmaceutical and academic sales up double digits. Our European sales grew 9% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up in the mid-single digits while government and academic business grew at strong double-digit rates. And just as we saw in the second quarter, strong growth in Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe.", "(6:44 \u2013 6:53) including the government and institutions. Sales (6:59 \u2013 7:04) government and university customers as well as increased demand from chemical end markets.", "In India, we saw continued (7:08) double-digit sales growth driven by demand from generic drug companies for LC instruments, services, columns, and networked information systems. Impressively, India growth was against a very strong performance in prior-year result.", "Shifting gears, I'd like to make a few comments on our TA Instruments division. Global sales for TA were up 2% in the quarter. Geographically, sales were strongest in the U.S. and China, with declines in Europe and Japan against tough comparisons. Year-to-date sales at TA were up in the mid-single digits.", "Now I'd like to comment on what's ahead for our business. In just a moment Gene Cassis will provide financial guidance. However, what's impressive to me is that our recent growth trends have been driven by strong and steady demand for our core products and broad-based solutions, including instrument platforms, services, and chemistries. These trends suggest sustainable growth.", "I'm also excited about the impact we're seeing from recently launched new products, such as the Vion IMS QTof system that I mentioned earlier, as well as the ACQUITY Arc System introduced in the third quarter. In addition, I am encouraged by our promising new product pipeline under development.", "Looking at TA (8:19) fourth quarter, our business (8:21) pipeline appears to be strengthening, and we expect moderately stronger and more geographically balanced sales growth as we close out the year.", "On the capital allocation front, we plan to continue to prioritize focused investments that strengthen and expand our core product offerings and technologies. I expect that our investment in internal R&D programs will yield impactful new products for both Waters and TA Instruments divisions that will enhance our tradition of technological leadership.", "Finally on the financials, Waters has a strong balance sheet and we anticipate continued strong free cash flow. As a central component of our capital allocation strategy, we anticipate continuing our well-established share repurchase program.", "Before turning it over to Gene for a deeper review on the financials, I would like to share some of my initial perspectives as CEO and a few of my priorities during our transition period. First and foremost, I want to acknowledge and thank my predecessor and our current Chairman, Doug Berthiaume, as well as the entire Waters leadership team. By any measure, Waters is a remarkable success, and Doug and the Waters team are to be commended for creating such a strong and sustainable franchise.", "The business is built on a strong foundation of customer focus and technological depth, and the organization represents a very special blend of expertise and passion. I have seen this powerful culture in our meeting rooms as well as in our customers' laboratories. Throughout my first two months, the Waters team has demonstrated exceptional professionalism and enthusiasm for me and our exciting days ahead. From my vantage point, our strong execution in the third quarter is evidence of the team's excellence and gives me confidence for continuing positive results.", "As for my transition, I am focused on a well-developed plan that is built around four priorities. My first priority is to lead the team in its efforts to deliver strong 2015 results. This began by leveraging existing mechanisms to deliver Q3 and will continue throughout Q4 so that we can optimize results for 2015 overall.", "Second, I have embarked on a rigorous program to engage broadly in the organization. I am meeting with and learning from our senior leaders as well as a wide range of employees. This has included every department in Milford, multiple sites in the U.S., and planned visits for our European operations later this month, as well as Asia in early 2016.", "Third, I'm accelerating my learning through a comprehensive briefing program to allow me to more deeply understand our technologies and our markets. An important part of this is to understand our business from the eyes of our customers. I've already been in the field multiple times and will continue to be active and visible with key customers on a monthly basis.", "Fourth, I am focused on preparing for 2016. Starting in September has given me the opportunity to actively participate in our planning processes as we set priorities and objectives for what we anticipate will be another productive year.", "Now I would like to hand the call over to Gene Cassis, Waters' CFO, for a review of our financials and further comments on our future outlook. Gene?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the third quarter our revenues came in at $501 million, an increase of 9% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by 7%, resulting in 2% reported sales growth.", "Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 3% to $1.42 in comparison to earnings of $1.38 last year. On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 12% to $3.94 in comparison to earnings of $3.51 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.40 versus $1.34 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in our press release issued this morning.", "Looking at our growth geographically and before foreign currency effects, U.S. sales were up 13%, Europe was up 7%, Japan was up 1%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14% with strong demand in India and China.", "On the product front and within the Waters Division, instrument sales increased by 10%, and our recurring revenues grew by 8%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 9%. For our TA Instruments division, as Chris had mentioned, sales increased by 2%.", "Now I'd like to comment on our third quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter were 58.7%, compared with 59% in the prior year's quarter. Year-to-date gross margins are 58.5% versus 57.9% in the prior year's first three quarters.", "Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were flat as reported. However, factoring in the positive effects of foreign currency on expenses, SG&A grew in the quarter as we funded product introductions and additional field head count to ensure customer support. R&D expenses increased by 13% as reported due to our ongoing spending associated with new product development and incremental investments related to our health science initiative.", "On the tax front. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 12.4%. For the full year 2015 we expect our operating tax rate to be around 13.5%, and in this projection we have not assumed a reestablishment of the U.S. R&D tax credit. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 82.8 million shares or approximately 1.6 million shares lower than in the third quarter last year, this being a result of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion and debt totaled $1.6 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $680 million. As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 665,000 shares of our common stock for $84 million. This leaves $520 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.", "In the third quarter of 2015 free cash flow came in at $114 million after funding $25 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of an investment associated with a major facility expansion. This brings our year-to-date 2015 free cash flow to $384 million, as compared to $324 million for the first three quarters of 2014. Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days this quarter, an increase of three days from the third quarter of the prior year. In the quarter, inventories increased by $9 million as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2015. This increase reflects a normal seasonal pattern.", "As we begin to think about our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2015, and in consideration of a challenging quarterly comparison and fewer selling days, we anticipate constant currency sales growth to come in at around 4% or 5%. Currency translation at today's rates would likely reduce sales growth by about 5%.", "Moving down the P&L, we expect gross margin percent for the fourth quarter to sequentially improve from the third quarters and approach 60%. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled, and will grow moderately from those in the prior year's quarter as we continue to fund R&D initiatives. Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $7 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at around 13.5%.", "Rolling all these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $1.89 to $1.99. This is for the fourth quarter. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first nine months of 2015, we now anticipate full year 2015 constant currency sales growth of about 8% to 9%, and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.83 to $5.93.", "Chris?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Gene. And with that, we are going to open up the phone lines for Q&A.", "In addition to Gene Cassis and John Lynch, Art Caputo, Executive Vice President and President of the Waters Division, is also joining us for the question-and-answer period. We're rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. And after Q&A, I will add a few closing comments.", "So Ashley, if you could please tee up the first question?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Sir, your line is now open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Can you hear me okay?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Hi, Jon.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, Chris. Congratulations on joining Waters and for a solid start to your tenure there. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of an expectation? You highlighted some of the things you're engaged in initially and your four points that you're focused on. When do you think is a reasonable expectation for us to have when you feel like you might fully have your arms around Waters and give an update on your strategic view for the firm?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thanks, Jon, a lot. I look forward to meeting you and everyone else. As I mentioned, I'm focused on a very rigorous onboarding process and obviously I had the chance to study Waters quite a bit in the time leading up to my starting. And as I mentioned, my first priority is to assure continuing strong operating performance. Obviously, I'm also spending a lot of time understanding the industry and the competition, and really truly what differentiates Waters so that as we build a strategic plan, it will be truly distinctive and something that will enable future sustainable growth.", "I anticipate a strategic planning process over the course of the next coming year, and as we engage, I expect that conversation to develop in terms of what we're able to say at what point in time. There are a lot of great possibilities for this company. The opportunities to grow are many. I'm focused on leading the team to help make the best possible choices we can over that time period to assure the best returns for our shareholders.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And this is a quick follow-up. Obviously, the topic de jour is in pharma. You mentioned another solid quarter in your biopharma broadly defined, including spec pharma. Are you seeing any, given some of the dislocations you've seen in some of those markets, are you hearing anything from customers or seeing anything in that end market that would make you a little more cautious as you move into 2016? Thanks.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thanks. In terms of the pharma business \u2013 and again, I'm new and getting to know these customers and hearing from them, and so I'll develop my instincts over time \u2013 but I just start by saying, I'm proud that we have a big core position in pharma. As you know, it's our core business. It's been our innovation driver for many years. Some of the most sophisticated users are in the pharma segment and that leads to solutions in a variety of others.", "But one of my early observations, Jon, is that we're also seeing this sector change over time. Of course, the large established pharmaceutical companies have been doing better, have improved pipelines. But we are far less reliant on that category of large established pharmaceutical companies than we were in the past. In fact, a lot of our growth now is coming from, as I mentioned in the comments, a specialty form of biotech generics and CROs. We also have a nice trend, I think in our pharma business of geographic diversity, where we're seeing greater contributions from different parts of the word. Really, underlying all of this are (21:38) a push for new analytical methods, as you know (21:41 \u2013 21:46) opportunity to participate in every phase, from discovery to (21:48 \u2013 21:57) model to continue to pursue as our main focus.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "All right, thanks. Good luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Ma'am, your line is now open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, Amanda? Are you there?", "Operator", "Hello, Ms. Murphy, if you are on mute, please check your mute button and unmute your line.", "Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Apologies for that. Sorry about that. Welcome, Chris. I just had a quick question on the QDa. That adoption has been quite impressive, actually. I'm just curious, number one, how much did that add to revenue and I'm not sure if you can quantify exactly but I think you had talked to a percent or so. Is that still the case? And then I think that's been really sort of an add-on product, so I'm curious if you could give us a sense of how much of your install base has adopted that step platform at this point. Just trying to get a sense of how much run-rate you have there.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thanks for the question on QDa and pointing out that this particular product, this mass detector that integrates into LC is a really neat product because, like I said in the script, it has mass spec capability to the broader LC base. We think we're pretty early in the process. This product was just launched in the last year, and, as you know, product launches in this business sometimes really take multiple years to find their full effect; and so while QDa clearly did enhance our growth in the quarter, and has over the past few quarters, we're not going to quantify specifically what those numbers are. We think we still have a long way to go on QDa and expect it to be one of our core drivers for next year. Gene, would you like to add anything to that?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "No. I think that covers it very well, Chris.", "Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Got it. And then on the recurring revenue side, obviously that growth has been quite strong as well and you've had some new products launched there. So in terms of thinking about that longer term, is that still going to be high single-digit growth for some time? I think it even got above that over the past couple of quarters.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "It's a good question. And I tell you, as I've gotten in and studied the business model, I'm very impressed by this recurring revenue stream. And obviously that consists of our service and our chemistry. And I've already been diving deep and looking for ways to create as robust of a recurring revenue stream as we can. One of the things that's driving our growth, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is that with our ACQUITY platform we see much higher attachment rates with our own chemistries than with the overall install base.", "And so as ACQUITY continues to gain traction and we have more platforms of ACQUITY on the marketplace, I'd also point to ACQUITY Arc as another big launch for the year that's having a big impact. You know we expect to see steady and predictable contribution from the chemistries business. And obviously, chemistries continues as a category to be a big focus of our innovation as well in what we're trying to do there.", "On the service side, you know we obviously continue to prioritize that area. The team has made some great strides in terms of putting even more focus on the services business with enhanced management focus. And also if you look at developing markets or emerging markets like Asia and particularly China and India, our service business tends to be a lot more embryonic. And so another factor underlying our confidence in our service line is the increasing participation of the service business model in some of those geographies.", "Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mr. Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Chris, I realize this might be a little bit early, but was curious if you could give us a sense of how you view the capital allocation at Waters and whether you think there's room for a dividend to become a greater priority in the future.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Brandon. I think it is too early for a conversation like that. You know, my first priority has been to understand the capital allocation strategy. Obviously, I really like the focus of the company around deploying capital internally against R&D and organic growth opportunities. And that's absolutely our first priority is to do everything we can to develop strategies and enhance our strategies to maximize the impact of our core business and the performance of our core business.", "And as you know, one of the other capital allocation strategies has been the well-established share-repurchase program, which is steady as she goes and a continued focus of the company. Obviously as I get into this, questions of capital allocation will be addressed and everything will start with first a question around our strategy and our long-term direction, and then all of the other factors of running our business to follow.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Understood. And a quick one for Gene is in terms of the fourth quarter guidance, can you qualify exactly what you're embedding for a budget flush effect here at the end of the year? And if you could quantify the impact of the fewer days, that would be helpful.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Brandon. You know the \u2013 I'll start with the effect of fewer days. Typically, it's much more meaningful for our recurring revenue business. And what we saw in the first quarter of this year, we had benefited from extra selling days. And we had between a 2% and 3% benefit to our top line during that quarter. And we think that the effect of fewer selling days in the fourth quarter will be comparable, so a couple of percent.", "If I think about the potential impact of budget flushes in the fourth quarter, I think we've been conservative on that front. We've been looking more at the momentum of our business coming into the fourth quarter. The whole issue of budget flush has been a bigger focus when you consider our large cap pharmaceutical segment of our business. And as Chris had mentioned earlier in this call, that's becoming a less meaningful percentage of our business. So I think when you consider the guidance for the fourth quarter, I would not bake into that the assumption that we are assuming that we are going to have a meaningful flush.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Super. Thank you.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Anything else?", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "No. That's good.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Mr. Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Sir, your line is now open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Good morning, guys. And welcome, Chris. My first question is on, really, operating spend. Earlier in the decade in periods of uncertainty Waters occasionally held back on investment in commercial infrastructure until visibility improved. In the midst of what has been a strong period of revenue growth that goes back through eight of the last nine quarters, I'm just wondering if you've been able to reinvest in your commercial reach, and maybe even opportunistically pull forward investment in areas that would position you better to take advantage of some of the growth opportunities that you see heading into next year. It's clear that R&D investment has been ramping. But it's less clear at the SG&A line, at least on a reported basis, recognizing that there is some pretty pronounced FX impact there. So just wondering how you're feeling about your current commercial infrastructure and how we should think about investment there heading into the end of the year and beyond?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thanks, Doug, for the question. And I'll give you a couple perspectives and then see if Gene would like to add anything. And you're right; I think you asked the question well. Our first focus is to ensure that we have top line organic growth momentum, and when we're in that period and we have good visibility to continuing momentum we want to make sure we're making the proper investments; and as you point out, we have been increasing our investment in R&D. That's a combination between investing in our core business, our core product lines where we've got a strong pipeline, as I mentioned, but also applying investment to some potentially exciting new growth areas like the health sciences.", "From an SG&A standpoint and sales force, I'm still obviously getting my arms around the commercial organization. It's a very efficient, very experienced commercial organization that's impressive in terms of its depth of expertise and the credibility it has with our customers. I've seen that first hand as I've gone out into the field and I come from a strong commercial background myself and, obviously, will be very focused on making sure that our team in the field has everything it needs to succeed in the changing environment.", "In the quarter, certainly I would say there was a bit of a catch-up on some of that spending and in growth investments in the commercial organization. Obviously, we try to balance getting modest SG&A leverage over time. In the quarter, SG&A spending grew on a constant-currency basis about the level of revenue. But for the first nine months in total, SG&A grew at a slight discount so (32:05) of the year, but we're also making sure that we catch up on that spending and make sure that our team has everything they need to sustain the top line as we head into the next year. Gene?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Chris. I think that sums up the situation where we are today. I just wanted to add that if you begin to look at our expectations for the full year, I think what you'll find is that the typical SG&A leverage that we generate from this business that is characterized by growing our top line one or two points faster on an organic or constant-currency basis than our SG&A, I think that will materialize as we look at full year 2015.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Doug?", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Yes, thank you. And then maybe if I could just ask one more. The commentary on the pharma end market was really encouraging. Heading into Q4 and next year, the comparisons in this end market clearly get a lot tougher. It's great to hear that it doesn't sound like you're seeing any change in the underlying dynamics of that market. That said, it does seem like your growth is increasingly dependent on smaller specialty and generic labs. These might be more dependent on equity market conditions. And just mathematically the comparisons are pretty tough. Recognizing that it sounds things are \u2013 like things are very good, do you think it's prudent for us to be thinking that there should be some moderation in growth in this end market relative to what we've seen over the last year-and-a-half to two years? Thank you.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Doug, just maybe a couple more comments, and without repeating some of the themes earlier, but I think you picked up well on our intent and really the reality of our pharma end market transforming over time to a much broader base in terms of some of those smaller players geographically. And of course you're right. It will be a tougher comparison next year. But we're not letting tougher comparisons get in our way of continuing to plan for success in these markets. And we're going through that planning process now. We obviously have a nice combination of new products in the market. But also, as mentioned earlier, that strong recurring revenue stream is a key stabilizing force and a follow-on to a lot of the products that have been successfully introduced and, of course, to continue to emphasize the new product potential.", "Our team is working hard to be very responsive to the changing needs of this marketplace and the broadening of that marketplace, as we mentioned earlier. And you know, what I'm trying to learn is just all the different dimensions of this pharmaceutical and broader life science end markets, consisting of large players, the smaller specialty biotech and generics companies, as well as the lab opportunities. So it's a good question. I look forward to a continuing dialogue on this with you.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks. All very helpful.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Matt Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you for taking my questions. And welcome, Chris.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I guess my question about sustainability of demand was just asked. I'll ask in a different way maybe. Heading into 2016 is there a new product pipeline that's maybe a little bit more robust than it was this year that could help you keep more consistent growth going into next year?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Matt. Appreciate the question. And we've touched on a couple elements of this, so maybe I'll try to wrap it into a more complete answer on the product side. Like I mentioned, we're getting nice performance out of our core base. I think one of the neat things from my perspective is it's not just one product here, one product there. If you look at our core chromatography business, we're really getting a nice portfolio effect right now of ACQUITY, Alliance and then some of the new products. The QDa was mentioned, the ACQUITY Arc, which is kind of a mid-range system. We're getting nice performance out of our super critical fluid separations and extraction business, and a number of these, including some of the newer launches like Arc and QDa and then Vion, when it really hits the marketplace, will be product launches that will have a bigger impact than just in one quarter or one year.", "And without getting too specific, the team is very focused and I am really trying to reinforce the continuation of the steady drumbeat of new technologies and separations in mass spectrometry, in chemistries that continue to enhance the performance of the systems but also to enable the development of new work flows and applications for more specific needs in the marketplace. So that's probably how I'd sum up the product strategy at this point after two months. And look forward to learning more and continuing to demonstrate the great innovation machine that I think we have here.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then just one last quick one for me; if renewed, what would the R&D tax credit add to EPS?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Maybe, Gene, why don't you answer that one?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Oh sure. I think that the R&D tax credit has the potential to benefit EPS by $0.02 or $0.03.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "All right. Thank you, Gene.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Derik Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is now open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning. And welcome, Chris. A couple of questions; so what was the impact of FX on the gross margin and to EPS?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Gene, why don't you get the details on the gross margin there?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Thank you, Derik. When you look at the effects of foreign currency translation, historically we've focused on the euro, the yen, and sometimes the British pound as the major currencies that influence our business. I think one of the things that was surprising in the quarter that we're reporting on now is that we had some pretty significant moves of currencies that are secondary currencies for the company, including the real of Brazil, and the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar all moved against us.", "And we had a much more meaningful impact reflected in the gross margin line because we really have no cost of goods sold and we have very efficient distribution operations in those countries. So we had approximately 190 basis points of FX headwind. Now, fortunately, that was offset by gross margin tailwinds associated with higher shipment volumes and favorable product mix. So it was actually pretty meaningful. It's interesting that gross margins did not come out too far from where we anticipated, but the way we arrived there was a combination of much more significant FX headwinds offset largely by favorabilities on mix and volume.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. That's very helpful, Gene. And just one final question; could you give a little bit more color about China growth, net market and booking? Thanks.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Derik, maybe let me just make a quick comment on China and then see if Gene wants to add anything else. But I'm very interested in the China business. I'm very impressed, to be honest, with the size of the China business and the length of time that Waters has been present in China, the credibility that we have there, and the foundation, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, on both private and government business. And as you may know from my background, I've got a lot of experience operating in China.", "I tend to take a long-term view of China. I'm pleased that in the quarter we had strong growth, double-digit growth, and the one thing we all know about China is not everything is on a straight line. But for us to become the preeminent global company in this space we will prioritize a leading position in China. Underlying demand approximated the sales growth and we continue to see relatively stable demand out of China. I'm going to be in China in early 2016 and look forward to diving a little deeper and understanding this market even better. But I am encouraged by the franchise we have in China and, for that matter, in some of our other big emerging markets like India. Gene?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "I think that summarizes it very well, Chris.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink. Your line is now open.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Thank you. I was hoping perhaps you could elaborate on trends in Japan by end market, and also remind us of what your business mix looks like in Japan by end market?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Dan. Japan, let me make a quick comment on Japan. And again I have not had the opportunity yet to visit Japan, but I will early in 2016. Japan represents about 8% of Waters' sales overall. It's more of a modest growth business, moderate kind of mid-single-digit type of business, a very well-established, loyal customer base. Very profitable businesses, as many Japanese businesses are in the instruments and device world, and as mentioned before, we had good business in the government and academic markets there in the quarter. So I think it's a very stable situation and a position of strength. But Gene, do you want to add anything more on Japan?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Chris, I think that summarizes it well, but I would just say that in the second quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, in the third quarter, we had a tough base of comparison in the pharmaceutical segment of our Japanese market in that in the prior-year we had some very successful large orders for informatics systems that did not, obviously, repeat in the third quarter. So I think that the underlying demand in Japan is actually healthier than the 2% constant-currency growth rate suggests, and we're very encouraged by the strength of government and academic spending as well as our industrial and applied market spending in Japan, and that is encouraging for the fourth quarter.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "And then for my follow-up, and maybe this question is six months too early, but Chris, can you talk about how much you might be willing to dilute the margin structure of Waters with either organic or inorganic investments?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think that type of question is certainly premature in my process to understand our overall P&L and our investment strategy for the future. Again, I'm trying to focus on the fundamentals of understanding what makes this business go, and make sure I'm doing everything I can to ensure continued strong performance. You know, a strategic look at the business will increasingly become a focus. Our goal is to develop a very sustainable, robust business that's delivering for the long term. I know that's not saying too much but I look forward to engaging in all those topics in the future.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning and thank you, guys. Chris, just want to start with a question about your prepared comments on the end markets. I thought you said that EU academic was up double digits. Is that right? And if so, could you just put come color on that? It's obviously well above trend.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Yeah. We did say that. The European \u2013 on a constant currency basis, the European business was up 9% with strength in that particular area. And obviously, we're seeing a lot of demand for many of our research products in that area. And maybe Gene can say a little bit more about what's happening in that sector in more depth.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I would say, Isaac, that the business that we have in academia is weighted towards our higher-end mass spectrometry product offerings, and it tends to be a little bit more lumpy. So one of the things about the third quarter performance is that we were comparing against a favorable base of comparison in the prior year, and that's somewhat the nature of our performance in that sector.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a bigger-picture question for Chris. Obviously Waters has a great track record as a company for being pretty efficient, everything from margins to cash flow into the great tax rate. So if you bring a different set of experiences from Medtronic. I'm curious if, in your short time so far, if you can point to any areas where you think that the operations of the company could be more efficient just based on your prior experience at a bigger company?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. That's a great question and one that we'll increasingly answer over time. But you're right. One of the great strengths of Waters is the very strong financial discipline. I think what you'll find is that I'll continue that tradition. That's one of the commonalities that Doug and I share and the management team and I share, and I think in many ways the company has done a really good job weathering FX and other issues plus investment needs to deliver sustainable growth and strong margin performance. And obviously, I want to continue that.", "With that, I will always be looking for new opportunities to free up investment for revenue growth drivers, particularly R&D as well as sales force. Those will be two of the bigger priorities. And I do see little pockets of opportunity over time. It's probably premature for me to comment on exactly what those are, but there are definitely some efficiencies that we can drive in all parts of the P&L as we grow and scale this business.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Mr. Tycho Peterson with JPMC. your line is now open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Chris, maybe just following up on the comment on your prior experience with Medtronic, obviously, there you ran businesses that faced more end-market challenges and secular headwinds. Clearly that's not the case with Waters, where end-market dynamics have been strong. So can you maybe talk a little bit about what in your operational background you can bring to the growth story at Waters, and then, along those lines, we haven't heard a lot about the Health Science Initiative, but clearly there are investments in the distribution channels and manufacturing we need to think about. Can you maybe talk a little bit about maybe milestones we can track, and should we assume at some point this gets broken out as a separate P&L line item?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thanks for the question, Tycho. I appreciate it. I think your characterization was reasonably accurate in terms of the differences in the end markets within medical devices versus this space, and obviously I'm continuing to try to understand what those are. And you're right; we are blessed at Waters with great end markets and strong positions that are in general more stable and more recurring than some of the markets I've participated in. Although, certainly I had some businesses before that had mixes of capital and service and consumables as well.", "I think, overall, what you'll see from me in terms of reflecting from my background as I come into Waters is a very strong focus on innovation. I grew up in a company that was all about some of the same principles in terms of being extremely responsive to unmet needs in the marketplace for innovation, where innovation can make a difference in terms of improving our customer's performance. And so I'm very interested in innovation and how to bring some of those lessons forward into this space.", "The priority for that, as I mentioned before, is in our core business to ensure we're doing everything possible to drive the core business but there are some very intriguing opportunities down the road. You mentioned health sciences. Obviously I have a personal understanding of more regulated markets, and I'm certainly not afraid of these markets; in fact, I'm quite excited about them. But we're going to approach some of these market opportunities in a very measured, very thorough manner. We've got a lot of work to do to characterize these opportunities, to build plans. And as we do that, we will look for opportunities that enhance and grow our top line and our margin structure over time.", "So this whole area of health sciences is very interesting, and as you know we're already serving some of these segments in terms of neonatal screening, (50:09) drug monitoring. And so the question over time from a strategy standpoint is just one of degree and emphasis, and we'll have an opportunity to talk more about it. At this point any thoughts on breaking out these revenues or establishing new structures around that is premature.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, I think you noted an uptick in industrial. Clearly the data points from the true industrial companies have been pretty poor this earnings season. Can you maybe just talk about where you're seeing the strength? Was that really just on the applied side? And your visibility into that channel.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Maybe I'll make a couple of broad comments there and Gene can comment further. But the industrial markets or the applied markets of food and environmental and the chemical industries is a really intriguing set of markets. From my standpoint, it's impressive how Waters has taken some of the core technology originally developed for primary use in the pharmaceutical sector and created new applications to serve those markets.", "And there are some interesting long-term trends, particularly in food security, food safety, food authenticity, and a good stable business in the chemical industries sector as well with a wide range of applications that we're in today and we can develop for tomorrow in a very efficient way. So we've been able to serve these markets, in my early view, in a very efficient manner both from a R&D investment but also from utilizing our well established sales force to call into these areas. So I think we're getting some pretty good performance out of them right now. Gene?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. The only thing that I would add after that good summary, Chris, is that if we look at that segment of our business, one of the components there is food analysis. And what we have seen in the quarter that we just \u2013 that we're reporting on here is that we had a particularly strong performance for food safety testing. And I'm not sure it is that we're yet seeing the full impact as the U.S. begins to move more deliberately down the pathway of mandating more testing, but it's certainly encouraging at this time.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good morning. So I just want to touch back on sort of the emerging markets. Can you just give us a sense versus prior periods how you would kind of characterize the current environment? And what would you need to see on the currency side, for instance in places like India, to get more concerned with what that could do to the demand trajectory? I mean it's obviously been a broader market issue, and obviously your business has proven to be a bit more resilient, so just sort of some context from the historical basis on that, maybe, Gene. And then on the \u2013 actually start with that and then I'll ask my follow-up.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Just a quick start to that, Ross; this is Chris. The emerging markets are a big focus for the company. Obviously, we're getting quite a bit of business out of there, and to your point exactly, the underlying demand in China and India and the emerging markets, with some exceptions. I mean we haven't mentioned Brazil specifically, which was a challenge in the quarter, so there are some emerging markets that are not operating as robustly right now.", "But certainly India and China are examples where the currency situation has not yet manifested itself in a fundamental change in demand, and so we're monitoring that closely but also doing the things to be successful on a fundamental basis for the long term. Obviously, other emerging markets like Brazil have been a little bit more disruptive and we're watching those closely and looking for ways to improve, but Gene, do you want to comment on that?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. The only thing that I would add, Chris, is that in some of the larger emerging markets we do transact our instrumentation business in U.S. dollars. So it somewhat limits our exposure to some of these dramatic shifts. But in terms of spare parts and some of our services, those are denominated in local currencies, so that has been a component of the FX headwind that we encountered this quarter.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "And maybe can you just remind us of the emerging market comp in sort of the key, maybe the key ones in China, India as we enter 4Q and then give us a bit of a sense of how the jump-off into 2016 compares to what we had in terms of the jump-off from 2014?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "In terms of emerging market basis of comparison as we look at the fourth quarter, I'm very impressed with our performance in India in the third quarter because we grew double digits off of a double-digit quarter in the prior year.", "If I begin to look at the dynamics in China, we had a very successful third quarter result, but we are facing a more challenging base of comparison in the fourth quarter. I remember last year we began to see the business ramp in the third quarter, but our sales growth really came in at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter. So our assumptions embedded in our guidance is to see a little bit of slowing in our China growth associated with a more difficult base of comparison, but we are very encouraged by the trajectories that we have in India and think that that has some sustainability going into the fourth quarter.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thank you.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good. I think we have time for a few more questions. So why don't we get the next one?", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I have two for you. Chris or Gene maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question. Just in thinking about the revenue growth in your service business, it's been pretty strong this year along with strong growth in instruments. But the growth in services has been strong for a number of years now, and so I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on if there's any relation between the growth in service versus your growth in instruments or any other color on what's driving the strong service growth over the last number of years? And then the second follow-up is just, Gene, within your guidance for this year, what are you now assuming in terms of the EPS impact from FX in your overall guidance? Thanks so much.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. And maybe just a quick note on service there, Steve, and Gene can comment as well. But you're right to focus in on the sustainability of the performance in service. And it's a pretty fundamental mix between both the contracted service business, which we continue to strive for higher attachment rates and good customer value and pricing that comes along with that, but also a fairly robust parts business and the continued maintenance. As you know, our equipment is heavily used and is used for a long time, and the opportunity to help our customers maximize the return on those investments has also resulted in a great service business. It'll continue to be a big priority for me moving forward.", "So, Gene, do you want to put a finer point on that?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, just on the service side, in the last quarter we did see a very nice service growth in some of our larger Asian markets, and as the installed base continues to ramp up nicely in those countries, and as there is a higher degree of focus on making sure that these instruments are properly validated, especially for pharmaceutical applications, I think that that provides us with a base of stability for our service business going forward.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "And the question on the guidance?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer", "Oh. On the guidance. Yes. Thank you. Looking at the effects of foreign exchange on our business, if I look at where we are year-to-date, foreign exchange has been pretty meaningful on the EPS line; we think it represents about $0.41 of EPS headwind associated with foreign currency exchange. The last quarter was a little bit more dramatic than we had originally anticipated. So for the full year and looking at the fourth quarter we think that the effects of foreign currency are going to be not quite as dramatic as they were in the third quarter because we began to see currencies move in a positive direction last year. We think for the full year the effect of foreign currency exchange is going to be similar in the range of $0.50 to $0.55 of headwind for the corporation.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. Good afternoon \u2013 or good morning, and welcome, Chris. Following up on the question previously on the service business, you said that it was strong. Could you describe a bit of the impact that your business is having from some of the lab-wide service offerings of your competitors?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "(59:50 \u2013 59:59)", "Arthur G. Caputo - President-Water Division & Executive VP", "Yeah. Bryan, one of the things about our services (1:00:04) business is that this is an area where we have continually invested heavily to make sure that we are providing the top service levels that our customers can (1:00:20) to sell an instrument. Invariably, they will cue in on service as being a primary driver as their reason for investing.", "The second aspect \u2013 and we find ourselves much more insulated from the third-party effect because of our basic strategy. It's heavily innovative based. Things like ACQUITY or LC-MS solutions, these offerings that consist of instrumentations, chemistry, support services insulate us from the traditional attacks that third-parties usually go after. And they're usually going after more commoditized offerings, where, quite frankly, our primary emphasis for growth is in the areas of innovation and performance. And the more commoditized offerings, while we sell there, is not what our customers recognize us for; so when third-party goes into the account, they don't associate us with as highly being susceptible to third-party as many of the other vendors in the industry.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good. Thanks, Art. Appreciate that. And I think as you can see, Bryan, the service business is a really interesting part of Waters and a big area of investment and something that we're all working closely on to make sure we continue to get the performance out of it for the future that we've gotten out in the past as well.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we're a little bit over time. And so maybe I'll bring the Q&A session to a close. But thanks for your great questions. I really enjoyed our first call here together today, especially the substantive dialogue we just had in the Q&A. I do look forward to getting to know all of you well. And as that goes, I am committed to interacting in a manner that keeps our communication open, honest and insightful. At this point, Gene and John and I are mapping out opportunities for me to meet with a number of you later in the fall, as well as to engage with the investment community more broadly throughout 2016.", "So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q4 call, which we are currently anticipating holding on January 26, 2016. Thank you all and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter Financial Result Year 2015 Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "John Lynch", "Thank you, operator. Well, good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the first quarter and full year 2016.", "We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company did not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update the predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2016.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning.", "In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled quarterly reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financials included in this morning's press release.", "Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, at this time, generally adjust for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.", "Now, I'd like introduce Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It's great to speak with you again. The last three months since my first earnings call as Waters' CEO have flown by. It's been an exciting and enjoyable time for me. This morning, I will share my thoughts and the state of our business heading into 2016 and our priorities for the coming year.", "I'd also like to provide commentary on the changes announced yesterday to expand our leadership structure. However, as I indicated on the last earnings call, my first priority is to drive our quarterly and annual business performance. Accordingly, let's start by reviewing the results for our fourth quarter and 2015 overall.", "I'm pleased to report that Q4 was another strong quarter for Waters. In the face of a challenging year-over-year comparison and meaningfully fewer selling days versus the prior year's fourth quarter, sales were up 5% as the positive momentum that we saw earlier in the year continued. For the full year, sales were up an impressive 9% with all major segments of the business contributing to this balanced result.", "Now, let's dive deeper by taking a look at the Waters division performance. Revenues for Waters products and services in Q4 increased 4% led by sales to our broadly defined global pharmaceutical segment which were up 6% in the quarter. Full-year 2015 pharmaceutical segment growth was 11%.", "Globally, the government and academic segment was down mid-single digits in the quarter against the very strong performance in 2014. For the full year, sales for this segment were about flat. Sales for the food, environmental, and industrial chemical markets grew modestly, up 3% in the quarter with slower growth in Europe offsetting a strong performance in China. For the full year, sales for this segment were up 7% with balanced geographical results.", "From a product line standpoint in the quarter, instrument platform sales grew at 3% rate in comparison to a strong prior year's performance. Just as we saw in the third quarter, demand in the fourth quarter was strongest for our bench top LC and LC-MS instruments used in broad-based life science applications. For the full year, Waters instrument platform sales were up 10%. ACQUITY and Alliance LC Technology Systems grew at a double-digit rate and the ACQUITY QDa mass detector continue to expand the usage of MS detection in classic LC end markets.", "On the high resolution mass spec front, I'm happy to report that we began shipments of our new Vion IMS QTof platform in the fourth quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 4% in the quarter. This rate reflects the effect of fewer selling days in the quarter.", "Waters service business growth was generally balanced across all major geographies with contracted service plan revenues driving much of the growth.", "On the chemistry consumables front, sales were up 5% and benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. Looking at the full year, Waters' recurring revenue were up an impressive 9%, a rate that's indicative of strong instrument utilization, growth in service agreements, and a continuing trend towards the usage of UPLC methodologies in more routine and regulated testing.", "Now, I'd like to cover Waters' division performance from a geographic standpoint. Starting in the U.S., sales were flat in comparison to a strong 12% growth performance in prior year's Q4. Modest growth in U.S. pharmaceutical and industrial sectors was offset by a decline in government spending. Full-year sales in the U.S. were up 10% with balanced growth across all major product lines and customer categories.", "Our European sales grew 3% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid-single digits, government and academic business declined, and industrial sales were about flat. And just as we saw earlier in the year, stronger growth in Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. Looking at the full year, Waters' European sales were up 7%, and similar to the U.S., sales growth was balanced across our major products lines and end markets. In China, growth was 9% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year with our mix well balanced between privately and publicly funded customers.", "As I saw firsthand during my recent visits to Beijing and Shanghai, we are truly a powerful franchise in China and are well positioned to achieve continued strong sales growth over the long term. Sales in Japan were relatively flat in the fourth quarter and also for the full year.", "Looking at the full-year results, sales were strongest for our chemical analysis business where we saw strong growth for food applications throughout the year", "In India, we enjoyed a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a truly remarkable full year performance in that geography. In the fourth quarter, India sales grew at a strong double-digit rate, consistent with our 25% growth for the full year. We continue to see strong demand from generic drug companies for LC instruments, services, columns and networked information systems. Impressively, India's growth was against a very strong performance to the prior year's result.", "Similar to China, we have a very strong organization and market position in India. In fact, I'm heading to India tonight, and look forward to learning more about how we can sustain strong rates of growth in this strategic market.", "Finally, from a business segment standpoint, TA Instruments' performance rebounded lastly from a slower 2014, growing 9% worldwide in 2015.", "So to recap last year, 2015 was truly a milestone year for Waters. I must compliment all of our employees worldwide for staying very focused on executing an aggressive business plan while we smoothly transition to a new CEO, and also smartly invested for future growth.", "Financially, 2015 was a successful year. Our strong top-line performance was delivered while generating significant operating leverage when measured on a cost and currency basis. Even with the significant currency headwind, we grew our adjusted earnings per share at a high-single-digit rate, while meaningfully increasing our R&D spending and investing in customer support personnel.", "As we enter 2016, we are focused on the following: first, we will strive to continue our track record of delivering reliable and consistent performance each quarter, while also investing for future growth. Second, we will develop our organizational capability, investing in our people and building the broader leadership team that will enable Waters' future success.", "And third, we will sharpen our long-term strategic plan, which will guide our ongoing resource allocation.", "I believe Waters is poised for continued market-leading growth as we focus on our priorities of product innovation, global market development and excellence in the overall customer experience. In particular, I'd like to comment on our innovation story, which I believe is a rich one.", "In 2015, we launched significant new instruments including the ACQUITY Arc and the aforementioned Vion IMS QTof. Launched in the second half of 2015, the ACQUITY Arc System is a modern LC system with the versatility and robustness required to bridge the gap between HPLC and UHPLC while continuing to support validated assays.", "In the relatively short time this product has been on the market we are already seeing the system's strength. Similarly, the Vion IMS QTof platform is creating good momentum as we are seeing increased interest and adoption of ion mobility mass spectrometry. These groundbreaking technologies augment the continued steady growth of our well-established technology platforms including Alliance, ACQUITY and Xevo Mass Spec.", "In consumables, we continue to expand our line of UPLC and specialty columns as well as advanced analytical reagent kits such as the GlycoWorks labeling kit for glycan analysis. We expect our 2015 product introductions to gain momentum in 2016, benefiting Waters sales growth and market share gains.", "In addition, our product pipeline is rich with innovative new product launches planned for 2016 that I will speak more about in the coming quarters.", "I'd like to close my comments by commenting on the leadership announcement from yesterday. After a nearly 40-year career at Waters, our Waters Division President, Art Caputo has decided to retire at the end of 2016, and he will serve as a Non-Executive Advisor to me throughout the year.", "It is impossible to describe the enormity of Art's impact on this company. He has been a truly unique leader in Waters' history who has personally influenced our market-leading performance, our many meaningful innovations and countless customer successes with Waters technology over the years. While I've only had the pleasure to work with Art for a short six months, it's clear to me that his business and organizational legacy has put us in a strong position to move forward. Perhaps Art's greatest contribution has been many leaders and employees he has personally mentored and developed.", "Taking advantage of Waters' deep reservoir of talent as detailed in yesterday's press release, I've had the opportunity to promote key leaders from inside the organization to our newly formed executive committee, establishing a forward-leaning operating structure that will ensure leadership continuity. It will enhance our strategic differentiation and further streamline execution. So, on behalf of all Waters employees, I salute Art and thank him for his extraordinary career.", "I also want to express my sincere confidence in our newly shaped executive committee in the broader leadership group as we lead Waters into the future.", "Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Gene Cassis, Waters' CFO, for a review of our financials and further comments on our future outlook. Gene?", "Eugene Cassis", "Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning, all. In the fourth quarter, our revenues came in at $587 million, an increase of about 5% for currency translation which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 5%, resulting in a modest increase in reported sales growth. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were down 2% to $1.96 in comparison to earnings of $1.99 last year.", "On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.83 versus $1.80 last year. For the full year, 2015 sales grew about 9% before currency effects. While currency translation reduced sales growth by about 6.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up about 7% to $5.89 per share versus $5.48 last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced full year earnings by about $0.59. Without this negative impact, earnings per share would have grown by about 18%. On a GAAP basis, full-year earnings per share were $5.65 versus $5.07 in 2014. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release that we issued this morning.", "Looking at our growth rate in the fourth quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 4%, Europe was up 3%, Japan was flat, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14% with strong demand in India and China.", "On the product front, LC and MS instrument sales increased by 3%, and our recurring revenues grew by 4%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 4%. TA sales were up 16% in the fourth quarter, and 9% for the full year with new technology offerings and acquired product benefiting the quarter and the year. Sales was strongest in the U.S. and Asia where the growth rates were up in the double digits during the quarter.", "Now, I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 59.4% as compared to 60.1% in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year in 2015, gross margins were 58.7% versus 58.5% last year.", "For both the fourth quarter and full year, foreign currency impacted gross margin percent negatively, masking the otherwise positive impacts of product mix and manufacturing cost dynamics.", "Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were down slightly as reported. However, factoring in the positive effects of foreign currency exchange on expenses, SG&A grew in the quarter as we funded product introductions and additional field head count to ensure customer support.", "R&D expenses including those associated with new product development and incremental investments grew about 2% in the quarter before taking into account the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange.", "On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3%. For the full year 2015, our operating tax rate was 13.8%. This includes the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit that was re-established at year's end.", "In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 82.4 million shares or approximately 1.6 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year, a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.4 billion, and total debt came in at $1.7 billion, bringing us to a positive net cash position of $731 million. As of fourth quarter share repurchases, we bought 595,000 shares of our common stock for $78 million. This leaves $441 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the fourth quarter of 2015, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $24 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investment associated with major facility expansion. This brings our full year 2015 free cash flow to $484 million.", "Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up three days from the fourth quarter last year and sequentially down five days from the third quarter. In the quarter, inventories declined by $18 million in comparison to the prior quarter.", "Looking ahead to 2016, our outlook generally assumes a continued strong foundation in our biopharmaceutical end markets and stable growth in our recurring revenues. Along with growth from TA Instruments, this will combine to help support a mid-single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to reduce 2016 sales growth by 1% and earnings per share growth by about 2%.", "Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by the negative impact to foreign currency. We expect to manage our cost and currency operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant currency sales growth rate.", "Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be around $29 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be about 14%. We do have plan to \u2013 we do plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average alluded share count of around 80 million shares, 81 million shares.", "Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2016 earnings per diluted share are projected to be within the range of $6.10 to $6.35. Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a rate of about 3% to 5%.", "At today's rates, currency translation is expected to reduce first quarter sales growth by between 1 and 2 percentage points. Rolling these factors together, we expect first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.27. Thank you. And Chris?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Thank you, Gene. And with that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gene Cassis and John Lynch, Art Caputo is also joining us for the question-and-answer period. We are rarely able to get to everyone's question, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. And after the Q&A, I'll add a few closing comments. So, operator, can we please have the first question?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question came from Dan Arias. Dan, your line is now open.", "Daniel Arias", "Good morning, guys. Thank you. Chris or Gene, maybe if we could just start by touching on biopharma a little bit this quarter, what you saw on a global basis. Maybe next year, just looking at the way in which you're seeing growth across the different regions given the comps that you're working with. And I'm curious this quarter whether you did see any budget clutch dynamic that maybe you had not seen in previous years. Thanks.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yeah. Hey, Dan. It's Chris. Thanks for the question. I'll pick a first run at it, and Gene can add. But it's been, obviously, a key focus of ours to monitor the underlying market dynamics in biopharma, which were solid throughout the year, as we mentioned in the call in the fourth quarter, with the tough comparison this segment for us grew 6%, and then double digits for the year.", "Obviously, we think we're seeing a trend in the market towards a broader and more diversified pharma end market that's not nearly as concentrated in the traditional large pharmaceutical companies as it has been in the past. But we're seeing a lot of activity in the biotech world, in specialty pharma. And, obviously, our generics business, particularly in India, has been a major source of growth.", "Yes, the comparisons are tough, but we do anticipate that the market trends that we're seeing in every phase of the pharmaceutical market from discovery and development, all the way through QC and production, are to remain relatively stable. And so, we are going to continue to strive for good growth in this segment.", "Eugene Cassis", "Good. And just adding on to what Chris said and following on your question about the dynamics of sales within the quarter, I would say that as the large global pharmaceutical customer set is continuing to be a smaller percent of our overall pharmaceutical business, and as that, historically, was the group of customers where you would see this traditional end of quarter flush, it was actually less pronounced this quarter.", "One of the factor about the \u2013 given the large installed base in large cap pharma. That's also the customer's segment where we saw the greatest impact from the fewer selling days and the effect of that has in our recurring revenue.", "Daniel Arias", "Okay. Thanks for that. Appreciate that. And then, maybe just specifically on the biotech set, I mean, how much spending do you actually see that's increasing post the capital raise? I think the consensus here that those two events are correlated. But I'm just curious about the magnitude of that dynamic to the extent that it does exist. Is there something you can help us with there?", "Christopher O'Connell", "I don't know, Dan. I think it's hard to tease out that particular factor in the biotech sector. What I've noticed, and I've been out into the market quite a bit visiting customers, in terms of the large biotech companies as well as a number of start-up companies is there is a rush of innovation in that industry. And you probably have the statistics better than I do on R&D spending and the ramp in R&D spending in that area.", "But the complexity of the molecules that are being worked on in the discovery phase, the development phase continues to grow, and the demand for more characterization is there. And so, we're seeing a nice, steady trend in that area.", "We're also seeing our technology being adopted in new and different ways throughout the manufacturing process. For example, I was visiting a major biotech customer recently on the West Coast, and our QDa system was identified by that company as a new entrant in their quality control process to ultimately replace the peptide mapping that occurs at the end of manufacturing for quality control. So, we see a lot of opportunities as the biotech business continues to evolve.", "Daniel Arias", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question came from the line of Ross Muken from ISI. Sir, your line is now open.", "Ross Muken", "I just want to dig in a bit on the biopharma side, maybe more so on emerging market. I know you mentioned, Chris, sort of emerging market generics, particularly India was strong. We're seeing a kind of volatility in the rupee and some of the other currencies. Just help us think through particularly on the instrument side just how we're supposed to think about demand in those verticals and maybe in euro over the balance of the year given some of those dynamics.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure. Yeah. Let me comment, Ross, specifically on China and India as good sources of growth that I mentioned, although it is a balance, and there's other geographies in the emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia and some of the Eastern European countries that are slower that's more than being offset by China and India in particular.", "And when you mentioned the instrument demand, one of the differences in a market like that is we are still being driven by new placements. So, there is the traditional replacement business. There's obviously a strong recurring revenue piece particularly on chemistry consumables, the columns as well as the service piece. But we're still increasing our installed base which is a good trend because that's going to be followed by the recurring revenue streams as well.", "As it relates to the rupee and some of the local currencies and those types of markets, I'll have Gene comment a little bit further, but a lot of our billing is actually in dollars in those geographies. And so, we're watching that closely, but as we build those types of markets, we tend to go first in dollars and try to stick to that factor, which will lend stability to our business over time.", "So, really, we'll continue to focus heavily on India and China because together those two geographies are 20% of our worldwide revenue growth, and while growth always isn't in a straight line, and sometimes can be lumpy, those markets both appear to be some of our strongest long-term growth opportunities overall.", "Eugene Cassis", "Yeah. Just building on what Chris said \u2013 this is Gene \u2013 and thinking about the currency impact. As Chris alluded to, we transact a lot of our instrumentation business in U.S. dollars, but some of our recurring revenue streams, our columns business and our service business are contracted in local currency. So, the valuation of the currency in China and India is one of the components that we're dealing with in this currency headwind situation that we have experienced for the last couple of quarters, and that we expect to experience during the first and second quarter of next year.", "Ross Muken", "Great. And maybe just turning to the pricing side of things. Obviously, you had good new product momentum across the portfolio. Can you just help us understand sort of the trajectory of price capture just given again some of the volatility and maybe some of the more economically sensitive end markets were in the academic side, government side? Just help us think about across the portfolio how that's differing?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yeah, from what I can see, Ross, the pricing continues to remain in a corridor where we're getting some modest low-single-digit type of annual price increases at the portfolio level. But Gene, do you want to add anything to that?", "Eugene Cassis", "Yeah. I just say that if you look at the difference in gross margins for the quarter, all of it is attributed to currency. And I would agree with Chris that what we're seeing is price stability or, in some instances, we're seeing a little bit of price increase.", "Ross Muken", "Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question came from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink. Sir, your line is now open.", "Dan Leonard", "Thank you. My first question, can you elaborate a bit more on what you saw on the academic and government end markets in the fourth quarter and also what you're planning for in 2016?", "Eugene Cassis", "I'm sorry. Can you ask that question one more time, please?", "Dan Leonard", "Sure. In the fourth quarter, it sounded like you were talking that the academic and government end markets were a little weak. I was hoping you could elaborate on that given strong funding backdrop in some circumstances. And then, what's your outlook is for 2016 for those customer classes?", "Eugene Cassis", "Yes. If we look globally, the government and academic component of our business has been around a mid-teens percent of our business which, in comparison to the overall life science tool space, is a little bit on the light side. And if you dig a little bit more deeply into that, you find that there's a heavy component \u2013 that the heavy component of higher end mass spectrometry within that number. So, in our -from our past experience, we tend to see that business be somewhat lumpy for us. We're encouraged by the increased funding that we see for next year. And if I take a look at the results that we reported in the fourth quarter and maybe some of the slowness there, the majority of that can be accounted for by a very strong performance in the prior year.", "Dan Leonard", "Got it. Thank you. And then, my follow-up for Chris. Chris, can you characterize your appetite for opportunistic M&A over, call it, the next six months or year as we're heading into a slowdown and opportunities present themselves?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure. Happy to comment on it, Dan. As I have been very consistent all along, I see M&A as a tactic that could be employed to deliver our business strategy. We will not see M&A generally as an ongoing strategy. We're focused first on the basic strategic questions of where we want to compete and how we want to compete. And if opportunities present ourselves to make a stronger and more effective from either a product line or a channel standpoint and if we apply our rigorous financial discipline to that type of an investment, we will assess that. But there's nothing in the environment now that would accelerate our appetite for M&A per se. We're focused, first and foremost, on organic growth driven by innovation.", "Dan Leonard", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question came from the line of Jonathan Groberg of UBS. Sir, your line is now open.", "Jonathan Groberg", "Great. Thanks and congratulations on a solid end of the year. So, I don't know if Chris or Gene or Arthur, if you want to comment, but if you think about the \u2013 your mid-single-digit growth on the top line outlook for 2016, which seems reasonable given a very strong 2015, I think you're guiding only 6% EPS growth or if you exclude currency, 8% EPS growth. If we think kind of the next three to four years, Chris, as you get to know this business, do you see anything about it that should alter what the historic kind of long-term model has been in terms of how much you're going to need to invest in some of these new initiatives that you've talked about? I'm just trying to think how we should think about the long-term EPS growth model that Waters has traditionally have.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure. That's a good question, Jon, and one that I look forward to engaging deeper in over time. Let me start with where you began. You're right, mid-single digit is I think a very solid outlook for this year, particularly on the strong base of 9% growth the last year and really that's based on a pretty broad set of drivers. We've talked about solid underlying market conditions whether that's in pharma or some of the geographies that we've mentioned. Certainly, the recurring revenue stream after a strong 2015 good outlook, consistent with historical trends. The new product uptake that we've talked about in terms of products launched last year but even some of the prior years.", "And in the mid-year, we're going to see a little bit of TA acceleration as well with their new product platform, internal analysis. And really, as we look at the year, we want to continue to focus on a number of these levers that we can pull, but also have a spending plan that really is designed to drive growth.", "And so as we see opportunities to take advantage of revenue growth in the market that we are positioned to take advantage of that. Obviously, the more we grow in the top-line, the more operating leverage we would feel comfortable shooting for and we're going to continue our regular share of buyback program.", "So, when you bake all that in, we do expect EPS leverage as you pointed out in the range you pointed out. And as I look at the long-term model, I guess, there's still a lot of work we need to do on strategy to really characterize what we think our top-line growth opportunities are. But we're going to probably stay consistently focused on trying to gain some modest array of operating leverage, while investing for growth but also that financial leverage. At this point, it's \u2013 I have not set a long-term aspiration for earnings per share growth, but we certainly want to be best-in-class and industry-leading in that regard.", "Jonathan Groberg", "Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Chris. And then just a quick follow-up, Gene, on the free cash flow, where are we in terms of the \u2013 on the CapEx that you're calling out, where are we in terms of stopping to exclude some of these incremental investments on the CapEx end?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yeah. Thank you, Jon. Yeah. Over the last years, we have been engaged in some major facility builds and also some facility improvements. Specifically, you all recall the new mass spectrometry center in Wilmslow, UK. And over the past couple of years, we've embarked on the modernization program for our headquarters in Massachusetts. And I think that we're still in the midst of that Massachusetts upgrade. I think that 2016 will be another year of investment on that front. Obviously, the Wilmslow facility is behind us.", "So, as I think about capital expenditures for 2016, I think they're going to be in a similar range to 2015. And I think there's an opportunity to, maybe, see a little bit of easing on that as we move into 2017 and beyond.", "Jonathan Groberg", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Thank you.", "Eugene Cassis", "Thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "Our next question came from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is now open.", "Tim Evans", "Thank you. Sorry to beat the biotech horse here a little bit, but I do think it's important given your exposure there. Can you talk about how you think about the funding environment right now? Obviously, it's a little bit more challenging. And, obviously, you've diversified your pharma base a little bit more heavily into CRO and biotech customers. So, in your 2016 outlook, are you expecting or are you factoring in a little bit of conservatism for this more challenging funding environment? Do you think that CROs and biotech customers in particular might be a little bit more hesitant on their capital outlays?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Tim, yeah, that's a good question and I would say I'm still early in my process of gaining more to feel for how some of those funding patterns work, A, and B, how they affect our business. I would just caution by saying that that particular segment of our business, biotech and CROs, is a smaller portion of our overall driver.", "And so, even if there are modest or moderate short-term patterns of the nature you described, it's not necessarily a major driver, and obviously, we're trying to build balance in terms of our business not just tied to new funding cycles and early innovation, but development programs that are occurring throughout the entire life cycle for those companies all the way to including the production environment and the advent of the biosimilars world.", "We're looking to gain further insights into exactly that question you asked over the course of the year and we'll update you with what we learn.", "Tim Evans", "Do you think you might be able to call out say, the exposure to a combination of CROs plus unprofitable biotech? Give us some sort of close approximation of what that is as a percentage of your revenue?", "Christopher O'Connell", "I don't know. That's the type of question that I am trying to get out in our own strategic planning process and I'd like to go through that first before I put that type of number out to the Street.", "Tim Evans", "Got you. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question came from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Derik De Bruin", "Hi. Good morning. Hey, so, a couple of quick questions. One, is there's obviously been some M&A in the chemical industry with Dow, DuPont, and could you talk about sort of what you're seeing in that exposure? And just some thoughts in Japan, I know it's been a tough market, and how do you think about the recovery in that market.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yeah, Derik. It's a good question. I'd say it's too early on the M&A in the chemical industry. And we haven't really seen an impact in terms of our relatively modest position in that market from an overall mix standpoint. And really, our business in that sector is pretty broadly spread. Trying to get a read on how a large merger like that affects our businesses. It's challenging and a little bit like the effects that we see from the large pharmaceutical mergers together.", "The one thing I can say is that a lot of these mergers to me, and I've visited a lot of this companies through my travels, feel like they're driven by strategic reasons to actually increase the amount of innovation that those firms are able to generate while gaining efficiencies in other areas to pay for innovation. And so, we're just keeping our heads down and trying to act no differently, even though those are larger companies, and try to stay away from any defocusing with their \u2013 with what they're going through and just support them in any way we can.", "Gene, you want to comment a little bit on Japan?", "Eugene Cassis", "Oh, sure. We have a long history in Japan, Derik, and we have an excellent operation there that is able to accommodate changes in the local market. If I take a look at 2015, the growth in pharmaceutical in Japan was not stellar compared to other places around the world. However, what we did see is a nice pickup in the food safety business. And I think we have within Japan a lot of resources that can very, very nicely customize our instrumentation to the applications that are important at the time.", "So, we see a broad continuation of that going into 2016. There are no warning signs that we have. We're not expecting the Japanese business to contribute positively to that mid-single-digit growth rate, but we are developing a plan that does include growth in Japan.", "Derik De Bruin", "Great. And if I can squeeze one final one in, just I got one from a client here. So, Chris, I think you came from a more medical device company. You're now running a more cyclical business, and there's concerns about global recession going on. So, you can talk about how your sort of your background is, as you're looking at now a much more cyclical, industrial global business versus what you sort of used to at Medtronic and just sort of talk about what you're sort of doing in terms of looking at the economic implications for the business. Thank you.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure. Sure. Med tech is not uncyclical. I guess, I'd say there are our own cycles in med tech, and certainly, some of the businesses that I was involved in had a large capital component to them and some of the same underlying dynamics. So, I'm actually finding some perhaps more similarities than differences as I get into the life sciences tools area.", "But really, the big lessons from med tech, from my standpoint that I'm really trying to apply here are to continue to sharpen our focus on innovation and where maybe in the med tech world, the goal was to drive new therapies to standard of care, the goal here in our measurement business and our analytics business is to drive our technologies to standard of analysis to have very positive beneficial impacts on our customers. So, some of those underlying principles of innovation and market development are really at the forefront of my mind as we strive to continue our track record of being a strong grower.", "Derik De Bruin", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question came from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Sir, your line is now open.", "Bryan Brokmeier", "Hi. Good morning. Chris, as you think about your industrial business as a whole, as well as for TA by itself, how would the global recession impact your business even if the U.S. does not enter a recession itself?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yes. It's a good question. And, again, the industrial sector is really about a third of our business overall and that includes industrial, chemical, food and environmental. And if you break it down from there, one of the course of that is the food safety and the food security business and that whole area is maybe can be thought about a little bit differently than the, which you might consider to be the core industrial segments.", "I'm still trying to get my arms around what the global recession, if you will, means for some of these end markets. Our business in these areas and particularly in TA, you mentioned TA is very, very diversified geographically and very diversified in terms of customers with very few customers that represent a significant portion of the business.", "And so, we're just trying to work collaboratively with these customers to make sure that they can continue their investments in our products, in their capital throughout this cycle. There undoubtedly are effects in certain end markets, certain geographies and certain customer segments but at this point in time, we are just trying to manage through that, and we'd certainly highlight any major dislocations or gaps as we see them materialize.", "Bryan Brokmeier", "And then, Chris, could you also elaborate on how the roles of the new members of the Executive Committee may be changing and how the decision-making process is changing?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure. So, thanks for commenting. And that we put out the press release yesterday on an organization evolution. And really, this was a carefully planned evolution as Art Caputo has contemplated retirement. And it's been a very smooth process. Art is a remarkable person. And really, the team that he's developed, the talent there is truly impressive. And so the opportunity to promote from within.", "So, we have a new structure that is going to enable me to be one step more hands-on. It's going to, I believe, accentuate our competitive advantages by organizing around major product groupings in terms of the platforms group and then the applied technologies group which combines our strength in chemistry service and informatics. It gives us the opportunity to have an integrated go-to market organization, sales and marketing under another leader.", "And really, what we're going to do is we're going to evolve into a set of operating mechanism that are very crisp and very regular in terms of enabling each of those large functional leaders to translate our strategy to execution, and to do so in a very efficient way.", "So, those processes are well under development. We really don't expect to miss a beat. This is a very senior and experienced leadership team in this industry, in this company. And I have a lot of faith in the structure moving forward. I'm excited about it.", "Bryan Brokmeier", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question came from the line of Sung Ji Nam of Avondale. Your line is now open.", "Sung Ji Nam", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Gene or maybe even Art, could you maybe talk about how the ACQUITY Arc is differentiated from the H-Class in terms of potentially target market segment application and things like that given you're talking about bridging HPLC to UPLC?", "Eugene Cassis", "Yes. Hello, Sung Ji. This is Gene. I'll start and then Art can add in. The ACQUITY Arc System is actually a system that's designed to accommodate methodologies that are in regulated markets that use HPLC separations technology. It's designed to be able to accommodate column lengths that are typically used in these applications but it also affords the user the opportunity to experiment with UPLC columns and see what the differences are in resolution and speed between UPLC and HPLC.", "What we found going to market is that there are number of customers that want to exactly replicate methodologies that were created on systems like our Alliance and we've designed the ACQUITY Arc to be able to seamlessly translate a method from a system like the Alliance LC System to the ACQUITY Arc System.", "So, that is the primary difference. The H-Class is designed with componentry and with a fluidic path that's more targeted to those people who are going to move methodology from HPLC to UPLC rather than the audience of the Arc that may want to continue for a prolonged period of time to use an HPLC methodology. And Art, is there...", "Arthur Caputo", "Yeah. I think Gene has done a great job of explaining the capabilities of the Arc. Maybe I could just add an additional flavor. Realizing that our business \u2013 a large portion of our business goes into the regulated environment pharmaceutical industry, biopharmaceutical industry, traditionally and over a long period of time, as we put in our innovation strategies, we get a mind to evolving our positions as opposed to revolutionizing them, so we have continuity.", "The ACQUITY platform is over a dozen years old now. And as that strategy was designed, it was designed to evolve. And at each \u2013 every several \u2013 every couple of years, what we did was examine its penetration into the business. And whether it was the original ACQUITY, going to the H class, going to the Arc and the other iterations, what you find is that we maintain a very current innovation position by watching how the market responds, how the competition responds. And the Arc is a very surgical position that we incorporated last year which took advantage of what we thought as the market moving and evolving in the presence of ACQUITY.", "So, the Arc has proven to be highly successful and that it wouldn't exist \u2013 that statement probably wouldn't exist if ACQUITY didn't exist. And so \u2013 and I think that the interesting thing is that you will see continued evolutions of this technology because it's a very powerful platform. And it \u2013 and the customer base continues to respond as if it was introduced yesterday. So that's it.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Good. Well, thanks, Art and Gene. Next question. I think we have time for a few more.", "Operator", "Our next question came from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Isaac Ro", "Good morning, guys. Thank you. First question for you was on new products. I know, I don't want to try and front run some of the new introductions you may have later this year at the various conferences but I was curious if you could maybe talk at a higher level about what contribution to organic growth you expect from new products this year? I know you mentioned pricing in your other comments but I was kind of looking at the opportunities set this year from the standpoint of internal innovation and new products? Thank you.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure. And Isaac, as I think about new products and given the pattern of how new products are introduced, I do take a little bit of a longer view than just those introduced this coming year. We will have some new products this year that we are not in a position to announce yet, that we'll just add to our portfolio. But with the way I think about it is the uptake of products that have been, that are early in their cycle and certainly the ones to highlight the build upon our traditional platforms of Alliance and ACQUITY would be the QDa mass detector that we've talked about, that's a couple of years in the market but really on a pretty steep curve, as well as the TQ-S, XevoTQ-S micro, which has really turned into kind of a work force product in mass spec applications particularly in applied markets like food and environmental.", "And then the ACQUITY Arc, which Gene and Art just talked quite a bit about and now the latest one is the Vion IMS QTof that's really going to bring new dimensions to defining resolution in the marketplace. And so, I'm looking at those four products, for example plus some other things for later this year and certainly expect those to be incremental growth drivers above what you might model to be an expected market growth rate of our core platforms in Alliance and ACQUITY.", "In terms of putting a very specific number on that, I guess, I am still early in my process in terms of understanding what type of statements we want to make and goals we want to set for the contribution of new products. But it's going to be a continuing theme every year. We added several points last year, and I expect that it'll be \u2013 that category of newer products will continue to be accretive to our core growth rate.", "Isaac Ro", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe a question on R&D spend, if I just look at the numbers this quarter, it does look like a modest sequential deceleration, and I know it's relatively small numbers on an absolute basis, but I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about the trend in R&D spend as you think about investing in new projects. Are there other projects where you're sort of allocating dollars away to fund new initiatives? I'm just curious kind of about how that all adds up to sort of the total spend.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure. No. That's a good question and it's something I'm laser-focused on because innovation is my number one priority in terms of our growth model. And, really, obviously, trying to get my arms around the overall R&D portfolio and the productivity of it and how we allocate resources to the most promising growth initiatives.", "But 2015 was a really big year for R&D. We increased R&D spending, M&A has reported basis of 10%, then upwards of mid-teens on a constant currency basis. And that brings our R&D spending up closer almost to the 6% type of level on total revenue. But also, keep in mind, we have a significant service portfolio, which doesn't have the classic R&D spending, if you will. So, really, R&D spending could be thought of as a little bit higher than that.", "In the coming year, I expect, we'll increase R&D spending slightly faster than revenue, probably not as faster than revenue as it was in 2015, because we want to make sure that we can be as productive as we possibly can. But it's really, in terms of the evaluation of when and where to accelerate it, it comes down to a portfolio set of decisions. And I look forward to giving you some more detail over the course of the year as I get my arms further around that portfolio allocation and where I see the better opportunities in the portfolio.", "Isaac Ro", "Got it. Thanks a bunch.", "Operator", "Our next question came from the line of Doug Schenkel or Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Doug Schenkel", "Hey, good morning, guys. So, I want to take a shot at two topics. The first on the quarter, the second really related to guidance. So, in a quarter where you, guys, had a tough comparing days working against, your recurring revenue was arguably better than what one would have expected. Generally speaking, this was a solid quarter. That said, it does seem like Waters Division and instrument sales were a bit lighter than might have been expected even recognizing the days impact because that typically doesn't impact capital as much, and you did seem to have strong momentum heading into the quarter. So, I just want to make sure that instrument sales at the end of the quarter were as you expected in that bookings heading into 2016, were okay as expected.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yeah. Sure, Doug. I think it's a fair question to always wonder about the different components. I would say everything we saw throughout the quarter was within a range of what we expected. And there's always different dynamics at different points in the quarter, but I wouldn't call it anything unusual as it relates to order bookings and what the book looks like coming into this year.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay. And my sense it's that while many investors were expecting guidance to come in below where sell-side consensus estimate is at heading into today, I do think it's fair to say that EPS guidance is below even metered expectations. Can you characterize how we should think about the error bars around guidance? Is it fair to say the bias is more to the upside versus risk to the downside?", "And you've talked a bit about how much R&D spend is factored into guidance for the year pursuant to things like health science. Should we view this as the beginning of a multiyear period of enhanced investment to drive some of these growth initiatives? Thank you.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Hi, Doug. Why don't I just start on that? If I take a look at the spending in the base year, 2015, I think what you saw is us ramp spending across the year, ramp spending up on the SG&A side, more on the S side and on the R&D side. And that's just in response to what we have seen as a very healthy end market. And that includes 2014 as well as 2015.", "And so, as we enter 2016, we are going to start the year off comparing against expenses earlier in the year that were not as high as they were at the end of the year. So, from that regard, it's a little bit of tougher base of comparison.", "We also know that in our business, the second half of the year is more impactful in terms of sales than the first half of the year. And frankly, it's further away. We look at the mid-single-digit top line growth as something that's very reasonable given the strength that we had in 2015, delivering a high-single \u2013 almost a 10% growth rate for the company.", "So, hopefully, we believe that we have a spending plan that will support a stronger top-line growth rate, but at this point, so early in the year, it doesn't make sense to anticipate that demand will create another top-line performance as we had in 2015. So, we're giving guidance with a high degree of confidence that these are numbers that are achievable, even if not everything materializes in a positive direction.", "Eugene Cassis", "Yeah. And Doug, I'd just add to that, your question on R&D and multi-year investments and so forth. Just to reiterate that our current R&D spending really reflects our core opportunities with only a modest contribution to some of the new markets like health sciences, and it's certainly, I think, premature to infer the this is the beginning of a new phase of investment philosophy. Investment in the business is going to stem from our strategic planning process. At this point, it's steady as she goes in terms of our traditional focus on our core while seeding some new market opportunities. But to the extent there's a shift in terms of how we want to allocate that portfolio in terms of new market opportunities, we'll have that dialogue in a very transparent way.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay. That's super helpful Chris and Gene. Thank you.", "Eugene Cassis", "Thanks, Doug.", "Christopher O'Connell", "I think we have more time for one more call, John.", "Eugene Cassis", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.", "Jeff Elliott", "Yeah. Thanks for sneaking me in here. First one, Chris, I guess, can you talk about the strength that TA had to end last year and how that can carry-forward into 2016. And then a clarification for Gene, can you talk about the selling day impact you had in the fourth quarter and what you expect from selling days in the first quarter? Thanks.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure. Jeff, to comment on TA, we did see a nice acceleration at the year, and TA, that's really a broad-based variety of factors. And one element of which is some of the more newly-acquired businesses that we picked up over the course of the year and the prior years as we build capacity. As you know, one of the elements of the TA business model is to do small tuck-in acquisitions that are under-resourced in terms of the previous companies they were in, and it takes us a little bit of time sometimes to build up that capacity, and we saw some of that towards the end of the year.", "And really, as we look to 2016, we do see some carry forward there to your point. But also the main event in 2016 for TA is the midyear launched of the new discovery series, thermal analysis family. It's an exciting new product platform that'll really pave the way for the next level of evolution of that product line and solid growth for the next couple of years. So, we're excited about that. Gene, there was one for you.", "Eugene Cassis", "Oh, yes. You were talking \u2013 Jeff, you had asked about the effect of the days.", "Jeff Elliott", "Yeah. In both fourth quarter and first quarter.", "Eugene Cassis", "Yes. In the fourth quarter, the selling day issue affects the recurring revenues in a more understandable than it does the capital sales business. And, in general, the loss of a selling day typically results in about a percentage loss of growing revenue. So, if you have four or less selling days and the recurring revenues make up about half your business, it's easy to quantify a couple of points and associate it with the selling days.", "In addition and it's harder to quantify, it does have some impact on the capital expenditures also. But I would say it's 2 plus percentage points of growth is a good way to think about it. And as we think about the first quarter of this year, you might recall we're comparing against a 15% constant currency growth in the first quarter of last year. So, it's a tough base of comparison, but in terms of selling days, there is one less selling day in the first quarter of 2016. So, using that same mathematics that we did to quantify the effect of selling days on the fourth quarter, that would equate to about 50 basis points of headwind associate with selling days, so not so meaningful, but one of the factors why we were a little bit more conservative on the first quarter growth rate than we are on the full year. Does that help?", "Jeff Elliott", "It does. Thank you.", "Eugene Cassis", "Thank you.", "Christopher O'Connell", "Good. Well, we're out of time. We're slightly overtime. So, I just want to conclude the call. Thank you, everybody, for your great questions. I've certainly enjoyed getting to know many of you so far and look forward to a continuing productive dialogue. So, on behalf of our entire management team at Waters, I'd to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters, and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q1 2016 call which we currently anticipate holding on April 26, 2016.", "Thank you everybody and have a great day.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference.

In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the second quarter and full year 2016.", "We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and in the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning.", "In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release.", "Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, at this time, generally adjust for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.", "Lastly, as you recall in January, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments Division. So, today on this call and into the future, we will now refer to the Waters products and markets and TA Instruments products and markets.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A is Gene Cassis, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. Since delivering results is our first priority, I will begin my comments with highlights from our first fiscal quarter of 2016.", "Overall, I was pleased with our execution in the first quarter as the results largely materialized as we expected. Five percent revenue growth was at the high end of our guidance which is encouraging to me when you consider that sales in the prior year's first quarter were up 15% making for a challenging base of comparison as we entered 2016. Sales strength in our pharmaceutical end market, impressive growth from our recurring-revenue products, and continuing double-digit increases in China and India are all continuations of positive multiple-quarter trends in these key growth drivers.", "Taking a closer look at our business by major end markets. The highlight was the 9% growth of our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters products. The growth in this market was most pronounced in regulated testing markets such as quality assurance and quality control testing. As we have seen for about the last two years, the strength of our pharmaceutical revenue was broad-based and highlighted by growth in smaller firms, specialty, and generic customers.", "Our global Waters industrial business, which includes food, environmental, and chemical materials markets, was flat in the quarter, with growth in overseas markets offsetting a decline in the U.S. Within this market, underlying demand for food quality and safety applications was strong in certain regions. And the decline in the U.S. is principally related to tough comparisons with last year.", "Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a slight decline of about 1%, with strong shipments of research LC/MS systems in China, offset by declines in U.S. and European institutions against a strong first quarter in 2015.", "Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. Waters Instrument sales grew 2%, weighted towards workhorse chromatography systems used for routine pharmaceutical testing applications. We are seeing significant traction for our newly introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued growth for ACQUITY QDa mass detection on new systems, as well as through upgrades to existing systems.", "On the research mass spectrometry side, we began regular shipments of Vion IMS QTof in the quarter. Waters' recurring revenues, the combination of service and consumables led our product categories in the quarter posting 8% growth in comparison to a strong prior year's result and with one fewer selling day. Waters' service and support business grew at a 7% rate with performance geographically broad-based and primarily associated with a strong uptake in contracted plans. Consumables 8% growth was largely balanced across major geographical regions with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC columns.", "In addition, we continue to see positive reception of our application specific preanalytic kits such as the GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling and our newly released ProteinWorks kits. Overall, the robust growth of our recurring line is indicative of our strong market share position, a growing installed base of our systems and strong instrument utilization rates.", "In our thermal analysis and rheology products from TA Instruments, business in the quarter was flat in comparison to a strong first quarter in 2015. We made a decision to launch the new Discovery line of thermal analyzers at this year's Pittsburgh conference which had the effect of delaying orders and shipments of current systems in the quarter, but sets up a stronger overall opportunity over the course of 2016. Featuring new instruments for DSC or Differential Scanning Calorimetry and TGA or thermogravimetric analysis, this new product line represents a step function improvement and performance in utility for TA's core business.", "Interest in these new platforms was high at Pittcon with a strong pipeline of new orders building in recent weeks. We expect the new Discovery system business will benefit growth in the second quarter and help support another year of strong sales growth and profitability for TA.", "Geographically, we saw a decent balance with modest growth in the developed markets and strong growth in key emerging markets. In the Americas region, the U.S. delivered 2% growth led by low teens growth from the U.S. pharmaceutical market in the quarter. U.S. industrial sales were affected by strong quarterly comparison as well as TA's Discovery system launch. We expect government and academic sales to ramp later this year as budgets get released.", "In Europe, we saw a similar 2% sales increase with balanced mid-single-digit pharmaceutical and industrial growth offset by lower governmental and academic shipments. Our most significant geographic growth in the quarter came from Asia, which posted an 11% growth rate with strong demand from China and India.", "Sales in China, our largest Asian market, were up mid-teens with balanced sales growth across all major end markets. We are very encouraged by the strong and steady business momentum that we have seen in China in recent quarters.", "I also continue to be impressed with the growth of our business in India where continued strong generic drug testing business drove a high teens sales growth performance. And not to be overshadowed, sales in Japan were also up in the high-single digits with double-digit pharmaceutical growth and general stability in other end markets.", "Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I'd like to share my broader thoughts on our progress. I feel we're off to a good start this year with solid revenue performance against a tough Q1 2015 comparison and strength in our core business drivers.", "Looking beyond the revenue line, I was very pleased with our team's execution on the P&L. We managed our expenses well in the first quarter, generated very strong free cash flow and continue to deploy capital conservatively, primarily towards internal innovation as well as our well-established share repurchase program.", "While first quarter results in the past have not necessarily been a reliable indication of how the full year will play out, at this point, we are encouraged about our 2016 prospects based on our belief in the sustainability of Q1's growth drivers, as well as our expectation for an increasing balance of end market demand over the course of the year.", "At the same time, we are also investing in future growth opportunities. One of my top personal priorities is to stay close to the science and technology, and to ensure that we maintain a robust pipeline of new instrument, applications and research programs.", "Related to my focus on innovation, I have continued to travel extensively, visiting a wide range of customers across our market segments so that I can gain an even deeper sense for their needs and how we should invest towards better solutions. Since I started in September, I have visited well over 50 customers in 20 cities on three continents. This process has been energizing, and has given me an increasing appreciation for the unique quality of our field teams, and the growth opportunities ahead of us.", "Finally, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our leadership team. We delivered a solid quarter while also transitioning to our new globally integrated organizational structure. I am very pleased with the pace of the team in seizing opportunities to capitalize on our unique competitive advantages.", "Now, I'd like to pass the call to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales growth of 3%.", "Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the first quarter were up 4% to $1.26 in comparison to earnings of $1.21 last year.", "On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.15 and consistent with the $1.15 that we delivered last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced first quarter earnings by about $0.08 and without this negative impact, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have grown by about 11%.", "Importantly in the quarter, and as Chris had mentioned, sales to our broadly defined biopharmaceutical markets grew about 9%. Geographically, the strength of this important segment was broad-based, with the U.S. up 13%, Europe up 5% and Asian markets growing at double-digit rates.", "On the product front, Waters' sales were up 5% while TA sales were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument system sales increased by 2% and TA instrumentation sales declined slightly in the quarter and were down 3%.", "Our total recurring revenues associated with Waters and TA products grew by 8%, with TA service revenue up 9%.", "Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically and before foreign currency translation, U.S. sales were up 2%, Europe also up 2%, Japan was up 8% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%. Sales of Waters' products were strong in China and up 13%. TA product sales were generally stronger in Asia, offset by declines in the United States and Europe.", "Now, I would like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in about as expected, at 57.7%, with a moderate currency headwind.", "Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis, and were flat on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 4% in the quarter, and on a constant currency basis, were up 2%, primarily as a result of a weaker British pound. On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%.", "In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 82 million shares or approximately 1.8 million shares lower than in the first quarter last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short term investments totaled $2.5 billion and debt totaled $1.7 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $786 million. As for first quarter share repurchases, we bought 745,000 shares of our common stock for $90 million. This leaves $351 million on our authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the first quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $141 million after funding $25 million of capital. Excluded from this capital spending is approximately $3 million of investments associated with major facility expansion. Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 84 days this quarter. Inventories increased by $24 million in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting the typical seasonal patterns.", "Now, I will discuss our full-year 2016 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes a continued strong biopharmaceutical end market, relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines; and we feel that these dynamics will support a mid-single-digit constant-currency sales increase in 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about neutral to sales growth.", "Moving down the P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by a modest full-year negative FX dynamic. We expect to manage our operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth rate. Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million.", "We currently expect our full-year operating tax rate to come in at between 13% and 14%. Looking at share buybacks, we plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of about 81 million shares outstanding.", "Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $6.20 and $6.40. Looking at the second quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a rate between 5% and 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to be about neutral to sales growth in the quarter.", "Rolling these factors together, we expect our adjusted second quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.48. And with that, I'll turn you back to Chris.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thank you, Gene. And with that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get to everyone's question. So, please limit yourself to only one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. And after the Q&A, I will add a few closing comments.", "Operator, first question, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Your line is now open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks, Melena, and congratulations on a solid quarter. So, just two quick questions from me. First, can you, Chris, as you've gotten to know the business a little bit more. I mean, what strikes in the quarter is the strength of recurring revenues, particularly because I think you had one less selling day in the quarter? So, maybe if you could just talk about what you saw there? Is that being impacted by pricing at all? Is there anything that's happening from a pricing standpoint on the services or the consumable side?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure, Jon. Thank you. And yeah, the strength of the recurring business is certainly a highlight for us and something we watch very closely. And as I said in my comments, I think it's a function of a variety of factors including our strong position in instruments and our growing installed base but also our ability to not only hang on to but enhance our contracted service plans.", "And your point on price is also correct that we do seek over time to maintain or even enhance our pricing power for these recurring lines on service and on chemistry consumables. And on the consumable side, we are benefiting from a continued uptick of our UPLC systems and higher attachment rates that we get on those chemistries which is a nice natural tailwind for us in addition to some of the application specific kits that I mentioned early and we're very excited about GlycoWorks and ProteinWorks and other things in our pipeline. So, this has been a nice source of growth for us. It's gradually increasing. It's a mix of our overall portfolio and has favorable economics that go along with it. So, it is a top priority for us.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, just quickly. I don't know either Chris or Gene, there has been some comments around Ireland looking to change how it looks at the tax rate that it offers companies there? I think you renegotiated Singapore but I'm just kind of curious what your outlook is for tax in Ireland and just tax, in general, if there's anything you're seeing there that we need to be aware of? Thanks.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Well, this is Gene, Jon. Thank you for the question and we carefully monitor changes in governmental tax policies around the world especially those that impact our company directly. And you're right that between Singapore, Ireland and the UK, they're all very meaningful to us along with the United States. But at this time, we're not anticipating any change in our situation in Ireland. The effective tax rate that we enjoy there is in the 11% or 12% range and as we look at the guidance for this year and look at the long-term outlook for the company at this time, we're continuing to use that rate.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "You're welcome.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys. Thank you. I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit about the competitive environment, you had obviously a really strong comp to work against this quarter and curious if you felt like you were able to take a little bit of market share in any of the key product areas.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thanks, Isaac. I appreciate the question. As you know, measuring market share on a quarter-by-quarter basis in this business is a little bit challenging and so in order to assess how we're performing competitively, I tend to look at \u2013 I've looked at a lot of data on more of a rolling basis. And market share is critically important. We do want to win in all of our major categories and I think looking at our growth rate in instruments, looking at our growth rate in chemistries and service and some of the different product categories, we do believe we've grown at a rate that exceeds the market. And so, we do believe that in the core LC business, we are gradually picking up some market share and that's our goal and we need to continue to feed that with innovation which is our primary lever.", "On the mass spec side, it's a little bit different by product category. While we've been under some pressure on the higher end research mass spec, we have performed in a solid way in the tandem quad business and particularly the new category of the QDa, have been a nice \u2013 a gainer for us. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag there, but we continue to really focus and prioritize our execution in making sure we're maintaining and enhancing that market share position.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks, Chris. And just a follow-up, the guidance for 2Q that you gave us was relatively in line with what I was looking for, but I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about operating leverage in the business? You mentioned the importance of the good expense control in the first quarter, and if we look at the top-line profile of mid- to high-single digits on organic growth rates, the bottom-line growth, historically in this business has been \u2013 has shown pretty good leverage, and I'm wondering how you think about that this year as you put your plan more into place.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure. No, happy to address that, Isaac. Thanks. You know obviously, as you know, the last three years, as I look back over the last two to three years, I think there's been good operating leverage masked by FX, of course, and the challenges we face there. And so, as we look at 2016 is a little more of a transition year as it relates to FX, we are trying to balance that growth and the investment in the portfolio, obviously with a good top line over the last year, and continuing to push the top line, we want to make sure we're feeding that growth with the right levels of investment.", "And so as we look across the balance of the year, I think our revenue outlook is balanced in terms of over the course of the year, each of the end markets harmonizing more to our guidance range. And we have an investment plan over the course of the year that is designed to yield some very modest leverage, obviously, with top-line performance, if top-line performance exceeds our stated guidance, there is some potential for some additional leverage. But obviously, over the course of time, I do feel that leverage is possible in this business based on the mix and the evolving mix of our business particularly towards service and consumables. The fact that we operate in very attractive market segments and the opportunities for scale up and down the P&L as we grow. So, that's really our approach. But overall, it is a balanced approach because, as I mentioned in my comments, feeding the growth is critical particularly on the innovation side.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Appreciate all that color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Maybe first on government academic. I know you had a difficult comp this quarter, as you did last quarter. Just wondering when you think you may see things pick up a little bit both in the U.S. and Europe, I know you talked about being a little soft as well.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure, Tycho. I'll make a quick comment, and maybe Gene wants to add to it. But the government and academic in general has been, as I look at this business, more of a back-half factor with lumpier performance in the first half of the year, and I think that's our continued expectations, particularly as some of the new budget gets released through the NIH funding that we've watched closely. And so, we've been relatively conservative on our assumptions in the first half of the year and expect that to be more of a back-half phenomenon.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Yeah.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And...", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Just to add, I think Chris did a very good job explaining the situation. I would just add that historically, our participation in those non-profit market segments has been weighted towards our higher end-mass spectrometry offerings. And as we go through this year, we will continue to see a ramp of our Vion instrument as well as some pretty exciting new product introduction plans at the upcoming ASMS meeting. So, I think we're encouraged at the prospects and we have a pretty good pipeline as we look at the remaining quarters of 2016, Tycho.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just maybe following up on Isaac's question earlier about leverage. Chris, one of the things you've been vocal about is maybe showing more discipline on the R&D spending and kind of rethinking maybe the way you approach R&D. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think about implementing some of those changes around systems engineering and maybe realigning some of the R&D priorities?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure. It is a very high priority as I mentioned. Thanks for the question. And I'm still in my process of learning all about how we create value through that innovation process. And as I have been vocal about \u2013 remained very, very committed to our position, I believe, in the industry as the most vital organic innovator. And in doing that, the question of R&D productivity is vital. The company has made great strides in recent years on sort of the portfolio approach. And certainly, some of the organization evolution that I've been leading is really designed to get after that responsive, more integrated product portfolio.", "One thing I've tried to take a look at, because there is so much innovation, is a crisper definition of the difference between what's in our product development pipeline and maybe what's in our research pipeline. And the good news is, there's a lot happening on both scores. Just to make sure that we get increased visibility as to our near-term pipeline, but also we're making the right bets to ensure bigger innovations down the road.", "As part of that, and looking at both the combination of our Instruments or LC and our MS Instruments, as well as our applied technologies, certainly, the market does appear to be tilting towards an increasing appreciation for the strength we bring across all of those categories and the more integrated view of our product portfolio and so, that's certainly feedback I've heard from many customers and the dialogue internally and I think the team's making great progress.", "I also want to comment on TA, because some of what I just mentioned in terms of the instruments refer to the Waters products but on the TA side, the Discovery series that I mentioned in the call has been long coming. It's beginning to show its promise in the marketplace and while TA has also benefited from some modest tuck-in M&A over the past, I think this cycle of innovation's going to make a big difference as well.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then just one clarification the $3 million in facility expansion that was called out, is that at all tied to the Health Science initiative? I know you've talked about new manufacturing to meet medical device requirements. I'm just wondering if that feeds into that.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Hi. Tycho, it's Gene. That is more tied to an updating of our headquarters facility here in Milford. We've had a plan over the last two or three years to try to use space more efficiently at this campus and that's a continuing effort.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Good morning.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Morning.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, a couple of questions. So, I'm curious about the gross margin. You noted that strength in the instrument business was in the workhorse chromatography, so I assume that's Alliance which I believe is a relatively high margin product, and then you had a high consumables mix this quarter. The gross margin was a little bit lower than where I thought it was going to come in. So, could you sort of walk through the dynamics on what was going in, the give and takes?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure, Derik. Maybe I'll make a quick comment, and Gene can add to it as well. When we think about the gross margin, obviously, at the very top of it is our ability to maintain price. And that came up earlier in the call. And so, certainly our pricing was strong in the quarter, particularly around our recurring revenues.", "And, really, what you refer to as a positive mix was offset by some currency headwind, as \u2013 pretty much as we expected, but volumes and factors like absorption were very much in line. So, this gross margin was actually very much in line with what we expected and should correlate pretty well to the expectations we've laid out for the rest of the year.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Hi, Derik. This is Gene. I mean, one of the things on the gross margin side is that the first quarter of 2015 was kind of a hard quarter to replicate. At the end of the (32:17) year last year, we had gross margins that were around 59%, and that's what we delivered in the first quarter last year. And historically, our high-margin quarters are later in the calendar year as we do a better job absorbing some of our fixed expenses.", "On the gross margin side, as well as almost in every attribute, the first quarter of 2015 was a little bit of a point off the line. I think that the 58-ish percent gross margin that we delivered in the first quarter is consistent with a full-year outlook that would bring you up to 59% for the full year, with stronger gross margins anticipated in the fourth quarter.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And just one quick follow-up, you did mention currencies, obviously, Japan's rebounded off of what was some doldrums last year, and the yen's rebounded. Can you sort of talk about Japan, and sort of like the yen pull-through? Thanks.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Oh, yeah. Just so you know that in the guidance that we gave, we were looking at a yen of about \u00a5109. It's a little bit higher than that today. We had a strong quarter in Japan, with Japan up 8% in the first quarter. So, certainly that is a little bit of a tailwind for us as we look at FX dynamics moving through the year.", "On the other hand, we have some secondary currencies that have been a headwind for us. And those currencies are in countries where the business tends to be a little bit lumpy. So, there's a little bit of conservatism in our forecast, anticipating that the tailwind that we get from the stronger yen could potentially be largely offset by some continuing headwind from some of these secondary currencies. But, frankly, it's a hard thing to call.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "You're very welcome. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. One, my first question is actually on China. Really strong balanced trends there. It seems like coming in to 2016, Waters and perhaps others had pretty strong backlogs in China. Could you speak to the relationship here between new order growth and revenue growth in China?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. Steve, I think that's probably a level of detail that we don't really want to get into too much. And obviously our whole goal is to make sure that our sales growth is balanced over time with our orders growth. And there is a longer pipeline in China than in other geographies for a variety of reasons, but I think on the whole, the results that we're reporting here on the sales line reflect what's happening on the underlying order side as well.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thank you. And then just one follow-up on the pharma business. Could you speak to how you're seeing growth evolving this year, specifically in small pharma and biotech? I heard a comment on the strength in the prepared remarks, but I wonder if you could compare and contrast it to what you saw, maybe second half 2015? Thanks.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. No, thanks. I think the trends, Steve, are pretty similar to what we saw over the course of 2015 and particularly in the back half, and that is a reflection of the greater diversification of the pharmaceutical customer base, both within these categories of traditional large multinational pharma, but also biotech, generic, specialty, et cetera. In fact, just as a point of reference, if you look at our top accounts, our larger traditional accounts, they grew more in the low- to mid-single-digit range versus the bigger parts of our growth which came from some of those other pools.", "And it's not just a company diversification, if you will, or a customer diversification, there's also geographic diversification. For example in the generic business, there is a very strong presence in India, as well as different parts of Europe, and even a visit I had in Canada, where there is a tremendous amount of innovation and growth and scale in that generics category and even some green shoots in the biosimilars category.", "So, it continues to impress me as I get out to see customers that some of the old divisions maybe, between who you'd expect to be developing small molecule drugs and larger molecule drugs, those lines are blurring. And the level of competitive intensity is high in that field, the level of innovation is high, but it's a more balanced approach. So, we obviously watch this closely. I'm continuing to try to get even more deeper, more granular understanding as to the dynamics and the sustainability of this market, but it does appear to be a very different market than what it's been in the past.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "No question. Thanks, Chris.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Hey, guys. So, I'd love a little bit more color on sort of the generic pharma emerging markets CRO demand front. We've seen, on the generic side, pricing destabilize here the last three or six months. So, I'm curious with some of the vendors struggling a bit, how you think about that at least from a CapEx perspective? Obviously on a units perspective, it doesn't really influence the recurring revenues much.", "And then, specific to maybe India and then sort of the CROs, with some of the currency volatility and then, in general, some of the struggles they've had on the FDA side. Again, how are you thinking more on the CapEx side of demand there? It seems like the business has been pretty resilient despite all the noise?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. No, Ross, I think that's a good word, resilient, in terms of how this market appears. And again, I'm pretty new in understanding this and spent time in some of these markets to understand exactly your question.", "At the end of the day, there is some competitive volatility in that market, and I've certainly had the chance to learn about different facets of that, whether they're American companies participating there or Indian companies, or Canadian companies, et cetera. But at the end of the day, if the pill count is rising, and the underlying operational activity is there, which it certainly is, then that's going to translate into that resiliency or that stability in the end market. Obviously, as you point out, the regulatory bar continues to rise for generic drug manufacturers particularly those serving the United States who are operating outside the United States and some of our competitive advantages in terms of our informatics are in power, chromatography data systems, for example. And what we've been able to supplement on the service side in terms of helping companies through their growth to meet regulatory compliance has all been positive factors in our device utilization.", "Our market share tends to be pretty high in some of these methods and in some of these markets and we don't take that for granted. We fight for it every day, but we continue to see this as a good opportunity for growth and by the way, that's resulting in some very positive things for the healthcare system overall and greater patient access to medications and therapies. So, it's good business.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "And how are you thinking about where you're going with gross leverage over time. I mean, obviously, Waters has had sort of a trapped cash issue like many and you've obviously solved it via borrowing and then being able to continue to repurchase stock. I think we're pushing at some point two-and-a-half times on the gross side, I mean, where do you think that can go comfortably and then does it make you think differently since you've been there a bit about M&A, ex-U.S. in terms of unlocking some of that trapped cash overseas?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. It's an important question. Obviously, we watch this closely and I'm devoting my energies over time and my CEO voice to responsible tax reform so, that we can have policies that allow us to utilize our cash better globally and to strengthen our country and our economy and that's the important message for all of us.", "But we think this is a very manageable situation. We do have capacity in the leverage metrics that you identified. And I don't see this issue compelling us to a different M&A strategy than we have. I mean my view on M&A strategy is very clear which M&A is a tactic for us that would be utilized for the appropriate business strategy if we see the right opportunity that can make us better and stronger and enhance the value of our products for our customers in our chosen markets. We'll do M&A but it's secondary to our internal innovation program and certainly not driven by balance sheet factors like you mentioned.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is now open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning. My first question is I was hoping you could help us work through the components of the EPS guidance change for the year. You increased EPS guidance for the year by $0.075 at the midpoint. I estimate that you get about $0.05 from tax and interest expense changes. FX seems to be about $0.08 to $0.12. So, it seems like there has to be some offset here. You didn't increase constant-currency revenue growth expectations for the year. So, is the offset here all increased operating expenses?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Yeah. I'll comment on that. I think your first observation, Doug, is accurate that obviously, the FX environment has changed. We started the year anticipating that the FX headwind in terms of our number of cents on EPS would be $0.15 or $0.16. And we saw around $0.08 of that in the first quarter. We're anticipating that that would be the lion's share of the FX headwind that we encounter for the full year. And I think as you correctly noted that there is an expectation that the amount of operating leverage that we get for the full year will not be the same level of operating leverage that we delivered in the first quarter. We do know that we have expenses coming as we go into the second and third quarter associated with what we hope to be very exciting new product launches. There'll be more material expenses, there'll be more marketing expenses associated with that.", "And if you do a rough calculation, you'd see that our full year EPS guide doesn't really have baked into it the 200 basis points of leverage that we delivered in the first quarter on an organic constant currency basis but much more moderate. So, there is an anticipation that operating expenses will increase as we move through the year and the basis of this increase is primarily new product launches that are planned as we move through the year.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. But just to be clear, did you increase your plans for operating spends relative to where you were at the beginning of the year or are expectations the same today as they were three months ago?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Well, the expectations are roughly the same, Doug. It's just that we were a little bit more efficient on the expense side in the first quarter than we anticipated originally and we benefited from that in the first quarter's results. But our expectation is that we will execute on the plan as articulated on the last earnings call.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And my second question is just related to TA sales. You noted that they stalled a bit due to the introduction of new products. Any chance you would quantify and relatedly maybe provide backlog data as a way to frame underlying demand? Thank you.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "I think we probably stop short of providing that kind of information, just to embellish a little bit on my comments, Doug. We did make a very calculated decision during the middle of the quarter when we saw some of the strength in some of our other sectors like pharmaceuticals to take advantage of the platform we had at Pittcon, which is an important meeting to talk more openly about our pipeline there. And in terms of the effect on TA, it was material to TA, but I think balancing the small hit we took in Q1 on TA is a encouraging set of quoting activity, demoing activity, and ordering activity that will begin to show later in the second quarter. But I'd stop short of providing backlog data other than to say our overall year, we probably have a higher confidence in TA based on the actions we took in Q1.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. Good morning. So, India has now had strong quarters for the past eight quarters. That's, of course, after a prolonged period of weakness. How much longer can India keep up that strong growth? How much pent-up demand is there in the market?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Good question, Bryan. I wish I had a great answer to that, and I hope there is quite a bit more. Obviously, we \u2013 like I said earlier in the comments on the generic market which is driving this \u2013 the signs are for continued stability in that market and obviously there's other factors in India which have occurred over time like currency shocks and things that effect local companies and those dynamics that you can sometimes never exactly predict.", "And so, you can't ever be too sure, but we're just heads down focused. We've got a very strong experienced team in India that enjoys very high market share in those chromatography systems. We're obviously trying to invest in new growth engines, as well, to balance that over time. The food safety market happens to be one example there in India that we're interested in. But I'm encouraged by what I see as a broader trend in pharmaceuticals towards the generic marketplace and the global nature of that, that hopefully will support continued strong growth in that segment for us.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And for the overall biopharma market, did you \u2013 was the strength consistent throughout the quarter? Did you start to see any tapering as you close out the quarter?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "No. I don't think there's any particularly noteworthy trends one way or another during the quarter.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thanks, Bryan.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Sara M. Silverman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks. This is Sara Silverman on for Tim. I just wanted to ask you kind of a broader question, Chris. With another quarter under your belt, do you have a better feel for any adjustments you could foresee making to Waters' overall strategy that you could share with us?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "No. That's a fair question. And I guess, I'm continuing in a process, Sara, I'd say of continuing to assess the company and obviously these customer interactions and my knowledge of the marketplace grows as each quarter goes by. From a high-level standpoint, I'm encouraged by the fact that the markets that we participate in are quite attractive. Of course, they're going to have their various cycles but over the long term, I do see these as attractive markets and I really am gaining a deeper and deeper appreciation and everything I've learned reinforces the unique position we have in the industry in terms of our focus and our record and our desire to produce industry-leading organic innovation.", "My first priority as I go through this is to really put a lot of definition around our core business and job one in strategy is always make sure you're maximizing your performance and potential in your core business and we love our core and we'll continue to seek first to optimize that.", "Beyond that, it's really a matter of gaining more and more clarity on where we should see upside growth opportunities in terms of some of the growing markets, new markets, and even geographic markets and I think some of the themes we've talked about even in some of these calls reinforce what those are. At the end of the day, we are taking a pretty deep and structured and thoughtful approach to this planning process and I'm energized, the organization's energized and what I expect to be able to report on in the future is just higher degrees of clarity on priorities around the markets, our chosen markets that we're serving, our product plan and the capabilities that we want to develop in the organization to get there.", "So, I don't think I've seen anything that pulls me off of my view of this business and the potential of the business. I'm very excited about the potential for Waters and making a big difference in the world and continuing on our focused innovation pathway.", "Sara M. Silverman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And just one quick question, back to the strength in Japan, could you tell us a little more about what the drivers were there? And how sustainable you think that is?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure. Japan is a great market for us. It's a big market for us. And in fact, I had the opportunity to visit Japan since we've spoken last. And what I saw there was a team with just tremendous focus and really kind of zoning in on some, I think, some good market share opportunities in LC, principally behind our Empower Chromatography Data System platform and a lot of those regulatory factors that are important to those customers.", "I also see an opportunity in the triple quad business where we have a little bit of a lower share but some newer products and also some market opportunity. The growth in the quarter there was broad based, as we pointed out. Pharma, in particular, was strong, had maybe a little easier comparison but had good year-over-year growth. And \u2013 but the end markets there were reasonable.", "So, Japan, historically, has been more of a developed market, more mid-single-digit type growth, low- to mid-single-digit type growth. And so, when we get a quarter like this out of Japan, we're excited. I don't necessarily expect that type of growth rate to be the permanent growth rate in Japan but we do expect to be very competitive in that market and we've got a great team there.", "Sara M. Silverman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is now open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Chris, if you just strip out the impact of new products on TA, can you comment on how you're feeling about the outlook for the industrial markets right now? It would be helpful to just get some color on the different segments of the customer base there in terms of environmental, chemical, food, et cetera.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, overall, the industrial markets \u2013 there is pressure on these end markets, as you know, from just studying the general economy. The comps were a little tougher in the first quarter, get a little bit easier over the course of the year, generally. And obviously, one of the big factors in our overall industrial outlook is the DSC and the TGA. In particular, the level of performance around sensitivity and resolution of those DSC and TGA products is going to impact a number of their end markets, particularly, for example, high-performance industrial polymer markets, aerospace, semiconductors, some of those types of markets.", "But I think another market that is beyond the traditional thermal analysis market in TA that's pretty interesting to us is rheology. I've actually spent some time getting to know some players in the rheology segment of the market and am pretty encouraged by the breadth of that opportunity, and particularly as we further integrate some of our new technology that we picked up through acquisition in rubber rheology.", "So, TA is a business that's characterized by a very broad customer base, smaller deal sizes. And while they are obviously heavily entrenched and tied to the industrial markets, we do, obviously, try to subset that market effectively and make sure we're pouring resources into some of those areas that we think can give us growth.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then, if I just think about the comment on growth in the regulated markets, are you able to sort of talk to the pace of transition of customers from HPLC to UPLC at this point? I'm just curious whether that conversion rate there is more or less steady state or whether that's picked up for one reason or another.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. That's something I'm trying to understand, Dan, as well. And from my perspective, it's a relatively steady transition, and Gene may want to add more on this. It's one of the reasons that we are so excited about our ACQUITY Arc platform as kind of a bridging technology to try to enhance that transition over time. We fully recognize that there's a large world of HPLC out there that we need to continue to serve well, particularly around some of the more routine testing. But over time, we I think are doing a better and better job of selling the benefits of UPLC technology and providing our customers more pathways to get there. So, hopefully that's a trend that we can continue to rely on. I don't know, Gene, if you want to add to that?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations", "Yeah, Dan. I would agree with everything that Chris said. And just remind everyone that UPLC is a fundamental chemistry technology, and that one of the best ways to look at the conversion or the adoption rate of UPLC is to monitor the consumable business associated with UPLC, and what we've seen is underlying consistent growth, and it's actually very encouraging. The adoption rate of the technology has been more slow and consistent and steady than we anticipated 10 years ago when we first launched UPLC. But it's actually been a nice core growth driver for the overall corporation's business.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thanks, Dan. And maybe we have time for one or two more questions?", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Thanks, guys. Gene, when you look at the recurring revenue growth, the strength there, I guess, is there a way to get more granular on the drivers there, whether it's price or kind of the same-store sales numbers or new products? Is there a way to kind of dive into that? Really, what I'm trying to get at is to better understand how sustainable that level is.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. Jeff, maybe I'll make a quick comment, then Gene can. In terms of breaking apart the recurring, again, you have to break it down by service and by consumables. And certainly, the factors you mentioned are all elements we look at. We try to enhance price. We want to make sure that on a same-store we're actually building market share, if you will, on our columns, in the installed base, but also as we just talked about in UPLC, the transition from HPLC to UPLC and the higher attach rates we get with UPLC and the value of those columns is definitely a factor that we try to break down as well, which gives us some comfort for the sustainability.", "On service, it's really a matter of continuing in all geographies of the world to enhance our offering and try to get that more and more reflected in the contracted service plans, which is a key metric we look at in terms of what by geography and really by type of customer.", "And on top of that, you've heard me talk about the customer experience, and we rigorously measure loyalty and the Net Promoter Score and our customer experience, which is highly correlated to increasing net service lines. So those are the factors I'd say that we look at mostly.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then just a follow-up there on the attach rates, the UPLC attach rates, can you remind us kind of where you are today and kind of how that's strengthened over the past year? Thanks.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. I mean, the attach rates for UPLC are nicely over half, more in the 60%-ish range and that's very strong and it's a multiple or so higher than on the HPLC.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mira Minkova from Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just to go back to the pharma markets for a second. I think I heard some comments earlier that your guidance, Gene and Chris, for the remainder of the year assumes more balanced growth over the remainder of 2016 across the end markets. As you mentioned, that academic and the government particular should pick up because of the NIH budget. Are you assuming a moderation in pharma? How do you think about pharma for the remainder of the year?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah, that's a fair question, Miroslava, and certainly we are making assumptions that give us the balance because of natural questions in the market and while we do certainly expect the pharma market to continue to grow at above our overall company growth rate, it's fair to say that we don't have unrealistic expectations in terms of the type of growth rates in the market we've seen in recent quarters. And so, I think we are taking that balanced view and looking at that portfolio of end markets to converge somewhat over the course of the year.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And on the \u2013 just to be clear on the TA DSC line. When do you roll it out and is that the back half of the year impact of the numbers or is it more of a 2017?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Well, hopefully, it'll have an impact in both of those periods. The rollout begins in the mid to later part of the second quarter. And so, we expect it to first really be seen in a little bit in the coming quarter but in the back half of the year. And obviously when you roll out a new platform like that and look at your installed base both for upgrade as well as new placements, that is a multi-quarter, if not multi-year effect. So, hopefully, we'll see the benefit of that over the course of 2017 and even beyond.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking my question.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thanks. I think we're over time but we do appreciate all the great questions. And so, thank you very much for being part of the call. I've certainly enjoyed getting to know you over the last six to eight months and look forward to our continuing productive dialogue. So, on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We do look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q2 2016 call which we currently anticipate holding on July 26, 2016.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "John Lynch - Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone and welcome to the Waters Corporation second quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the third quarter and full year 2016.", "We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release.", "Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.", "Lastly, as you recall in January of this year, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments Division. So, on this call and into the future, we will continue to refer to Waters products and markets and TA Instruments products and markets.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A session is Gene Cassis, Chief Financial Officer. As with past earnings calls I will provide an overview of our second quarter results as well as some broader commentary.", "I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results exceeded our expectations with revenue growth of 8% against a strong base of comparison, and earnings per share growth of 15% at constant currency or 20% growth as reported. Revenue performance was broad-based across end markets, product lines and geographies, with our key business drivers continuing to provide reliable growth.", "Our strong earnings performance resulted from a combination of a robust top line, positive mix dynamics, and disciplined expense management while continuing to invest in R&D and our growth initiatives.", "Taking a closer look at our major end markets, our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters products once again led the way with 12% growth in the quarter. We saw solid growth in our core small molecule QA/QC workflows, as well as in large molecule R&D oriented applications.", "Year-to-date, the pharmaceutical market has grown 11% for us, on top of a double-digit growth rate in the first half of 2015. Though our growth in the pharmaceutical market continues to be primarily driven by smaller and specialty firms, our largest global customers also increased their business with us in the quarter at a mid-single-digit rate.", "Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical end markets, grew 7% in the quarter, and represented a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter. Highlights in the industrial sector included double-digit growth in our TA product category, as well as solid growth in Waters products sold to food markets.", "Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 4% decline in the second quarter, which was primarily affected by significant weakness in Japan.", "Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter, Waters instrument sales grew 7%, with positive demand for core LC and bench-top LC/MS platforms. We are seeing significant traction for our recently introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued strength in our other core LC offerings. These are workhorse systems that are heavily used in regulated pharmaceutical testing methods and are typically deployed in laboratories that have standardized on our industry leading Empower CDS software. We continue to champion the use of mass spectrometry detection for LC workflows and as part of this we see broader and deeper adoption of our ACQUITY QDa mass detector.", "On the research mass spec side, interest for our newest bench-top systems, including the Xevo QTof G2-XS for biologic workflows and our newly launched Xevo TQ-XS for demanding quantification applications, is increasing as we move into the second half of the year.", "Waters' total recurring revenue, the combination of service and consumables, grew at 10% in Q2. Our service and support business grew at a 9% rate, with balanced performance geographically associated with increased demand for service plans. Consumables sales were up 11%, with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC columns, protein separation columns and Oasis PRiME sample preparation cartridges.", "Our GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling kits continue to revolutionize the characterization of glycans for biopharma development and quality testing applications. The speed and simplicity of this new analytical workflow and proprietary chemistry kit is helping to bring new protein-based therapies to market more quickly and at the same time presents Waters with future business opportunities for bio QC system sales.", "Overall, I'm very pleased with the strength and the stability of our recurring revenue lines as an indication of the depth of Waters's support among high-utilization customers, as well as the financial benefits of these attractive components of our business profile.", "Turning to our TA Instruments products, this business was yet another highlight of the quarter, with 10% growth performance. As you may recall, TA launched a new thermal product line called the Discovery Series in the first quarter. While the timing of this launch may have had the effect of delaying new system orders in the first quarter, shipments of the new Discovery DSC benefited TA's growth in the second quarter. The new Discovery TGA system, which is often ordered along with the DSC, will begin to ship this quarter. These new products are being well-received by the market.", "Finally, looking at the quarter geographically, we generally saw healthy trends around the globe. North American sales grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate, European sales grew at a low double-digit rate and Asian sales grew a high single-digit rate. Growth in the United States was highlighted by continued strong pharmaceutical demand, partially offset by lower governmental and academic spending. The second half of 2016 should benefit from a combination of new product launches, including our Xevo TQ-XS, our Vion IMS QTof and a new line of CORTECS Columns, as well as expected higher spending by governmental agencies in the coming months.", "In Europe, we also saw strong pharmaceutical trends, while overall growth was augmented by better demand for service and mass spectrometry technology. In Western Europe, our business momentum continued smoothly despite the news surrounding the Brexit vote. At this point, it's premature to assess the longer-term effects of the UK's exit from the EU, and therefore our focus continues to be on our customer base and our business operations in the region.", "Asia continues to be an area of geographical strength for Waters, highlighted by strong double-digit growth rates in China. And this is off an impressive prior year's performance. Our business in China benefited from strong pharmaceutical sector sales, good balance across end markets and strengthening recurring revenue sales. Our Waters business in Japan grew modestly in the quarter, with strong pharmaceutical sales offsetting a meaningful decline in governmentally funded research spending due to a recent shift of public money towards earthquake disaster relief.", "In total, our first half of 2016 was strong, with revenues and profits trending ahead of our initial expectations. Business trends in the broadly defined biopharmaceutical customer base, our core business, suggest a continuation of stability from this end market in the second half of the year.", "We have also effectively managed our spending year to date and created operating leverage that can be better seen with neutral currency dynamics, all while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our growth.", "At the same time, we are investing time as a management team to think about the future and how we build on our success in our core business, as well as create new vectors of growth. As I've commented on before, we've embarked on a strategy development process that's providing a framework for ongoing business analysis and long-range planning. In this process, we are aiming to clearly articulate the unique strengths of Waters that have enabled us to generate superior long-term returns to build on these strengths and to ensure that we apply our differentiated skills to compelling new growth opportunities. I look forward to updating you on more specifics in 2017.", "Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I would simply like to comment how pleased I am with how the Waters team has performed since I began last September. Our leadership team as well as all of our employees throughout the world are focused and are executing. Personally, I continue to emphasize customer and employee engagement as I gain ever-increasing comfort with our unique business model and growth opportunities. The relationships I've established with key customers, my Waters colleagues and our board of directors have been very supportive and energizing. I am excited about our days ahead.", "Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the second quarter our revenues came in at $537 million, an increase of about 8.5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter were up 20% to $1.58 in comparison to earnings of $1.32 last year. On a GAAP basis our earnings were $1.57 as compared to $1.27 for the second quarter of last year.", "The impact of foreign exchange increased second quarter earnings by about $0.06 and without this positive effect our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share would have grown by about 15%.", "On the product front, Waters sales were up 8% while TA sales were up 10%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS Instrument platform sales increased by 7% and TA's Instrumentation sales grew by 11% in the second quarter. Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 10% with TA service revenue up 9%.", "Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 5%, Europe was up 12%, Japan up 3% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were also up 10%. Sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China and in Europe. TA product sales showed broad-based strength in the U.S., Japan and in Europe.", "Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.9% versus 57.8% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first half of 2015.", "Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 10% in the quarter on a constant currency basis and were up about 7% on a reported basis, this primarily due to a weaker British pound.", "On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14%. In the quarter net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 81.5 million shares or approximately 1.9 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Turning now to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $843 million. As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 565,000 shares of our common stock for $77 million. This leaves $275 million on our authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.", "In the second quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $25 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investments associated with facilities expansion.", "Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter, inventory levels about flat in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.", "Now I'd like to discuss our full-year 2016 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes the continued growth in biopharmaceutical end-markets, strong recurring revenue growth and relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. We feel these dynamics support a 6% to 7% constant currency sales increase for the full year 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about neutral to sales, again looking at the full-year.", "Moving down the P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 and come in at around 59%. We expect to manage our operating cash expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth.", "Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million. We expect our full-year operating tax rate to come in at around 14%.", "Looking at share buybacks, we plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 and at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 81 million shares outstanding.", "Now rolling all this together, and again on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are now anticipated to be within a range of $6.45 to $6.60. Looking at the third quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a constant currency rate of around 6%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add about a half of a percentage point to sales growth in the third quarter. Rolling all these factors together, we anticipate our adjusted third quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $1.52 to $1.62.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Great. Thank you, Gene. And with that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions please contact our investor relations team after the call. And after the Q&A, I will add a few closing comments.", "Liz, first question please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Speakers, our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning. Sorry about that. I had the mute on. Hey, congratulations on the quarter, very strong. Hey, just could you talk a little bit more about what you were seeing in the Japanese markets and some of the delays, I mean did that happen relatively late in the quarter, just curious on the dynamics in terms of some of the funding shifts?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure, Derik, maybe I'll just provide a little introduction and then Gene can comment more. It's really a tale of two cities in Japan right now, the core pharma business as we commented has been pretty steady and it was pretty strong, but as we alluded to, there have been some domestic priorities within the Japanese government. And what we hope to believe is a temporary shift of government funding dollars, and therefore we saw a pretty significant fall off in our government business, which really had the effect of offsetting what was about flat growth around the rest of the world in that sector, but obviously brought Japan down to kind of the low single digits as we said. Gene, any more on that?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, the only thing that I would add to what Chris mentioned is that our TA Instruments group had a strong showing in Japan in the quarter, indicating that there is a hunger for new products there as well as funds to invest for new technology, and this is on the industrial side.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And sticking with Japan for just a follow-up, could you remind us on your overall sales exposure there? And just sort of how the strengthening of the yen sort of will impact you?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Well, the business in Japan has been around 8% of our overall revenues. And as you look at currency translation rates between last year and this year, we've seen 10% plus appreciation in the yen. And frankly, we have a very efficient operation there. So, we \u2013 our yen-based expenses are well under control. And so, when you see this kind of fluctuation in the value of the yen moving in the positive direction, there's a significantly positive flow through to our operating income line.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "All right. Thank you, Derik.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is open.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you. Would you mind talking a little bit about what the government-academic market looked like in the U.S. more specifically, maybe just drill down on that a little bit?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure. Government and academic market in the U.S. was a little bit weak, I would \u2013 not nearly as weak as the Japanese market, I'd call it a slight decline and that was actually a little bit stronger than in the first quarter. As we commented, Tim, last quarter in our conference call we've really been looking to the second half of the year for the government and academic markets to be more robust and at this point in time, we hold with that assumption.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning. Thanks a bunch. Chris, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the differences you saw in the growth rates within pharma between R&D labs versus QA, just trying to get a sense of what's driving the most upside in that customer group?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure. Happy to address that, Isaac. The growth in pharma was pretty broad based and broad based in a few dimensions. First of all, when I look at it, I'm looking at small molecule, large molecule, bioanalysis. Those type of product segments if you will, we saw pretty reasonable growth. We saw a good balance geographically. We mentioned China, Japan, but obviously the U.S. and particularly Europe, which happens to be a pharma heavy market, was solid.", "Our workhorse products are as you know, utilized mostly in late stage development and in routine testing applications and methods in the QC phase and that's really seen by the strength of the recurring revenues, particularly the consumables obviously and also the service piece, and so from the standpoint of QA versus R&D I would say, we remained consistently solid in the QA area and that's been a strong line for some time and it feels to me like we're probably doing better in R&D. And a lot of that has to do with broad trends in the marketplace that we see in terms of the increasing diversity of the types of molecules that are in the pipeline, more utilization of mass spec detection in some of those development efforts, which, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we hope flow through to bio QC type of workflows. So we're really trying to get as granular as we possibly can to understand all the different segments of the pharma market and make sure that we're positioned well in all of them.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, great. And maybe just a longer-term question. You've been at the helm here coming up on a year pretty soon, and I think in the last couple of months you've started to talk a little bit more about ways to leverage the Waters portfolio into the rise in biologics and the whole concept that you could maybe help play a role in the QA process for that category of drugs. And curious if you have an updated view on how to do that. It's obviously a little bit of a straightforward situation with HPLC in small molecule, but I'm wondering if you have an updated view on how to monetize your technology in the large molecule arena? Thank you.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. It's a good question, Isaac, and it's really a pretty core question as we look at our long-range planning, and maybe I'll stop short of saying too much because our \u2013 we're really right in the middle of lot of that work. But we are indeed, in our long-range planning, trying to break down some of these segments and ask the question what does it take to compete and what does it take to win in terms of the adoption of our technology in small molecule versus large molecule. And clearly, as you allude to, the biologics world is innovating at a pretty feverish pace, and some of our technologies, particularly some of our new integrated LC/MS workflows, appear to have some good traction and provide a nice opportunity to build a nice franchise in that area. And so obviously that's right in the heart of our core business, and it's going to be a strategic priority.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMC. Sir, your line is open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Chris, I'm wondering if you can elaborate on your comment that demand on the pharma side from large customers picked up this quarter? Obviously, you've done really well with smaller and specialty firms, but you did seem to go out of your way to emphasize growth in the large side.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. No. Tycho, I guess what I was saying there is, as you know in previous quarters, at least the three prior quarters that I reported here, we saw probably a more stark difference between the smaller and specialty firms versus the traditional large customers, and I think we've always thought that's actually a strength, because it's a broadening portfolio of customers. We're not really reliant on the traditional large multinational type of big account customers as we may have been five or 10 years ago, and that's been a strength.", "That said, other sectors have been stronger than the top customers. But we have seen in recent months and in the quarter, the bigger customers really come back a little bit and get more into that mid-single-digit growth range that I saw. So we were actually very pleased to see that, and I think that reflects trends that I see as I go out into the market and talk with customers, and as you know I'm out and about a lot, and particularly as you get into some of the larger traditional pharma companies, what I see is greater diversities within their own portfolios, chemical entities as well as biologic entities. And so I think that's what's driving it.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then, on the industrial side, you had a nice pickup there, how much of that was a function of just new product cadence as you highlighted from TA versus end market demand there picking up a bit?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, TA has been pretty solid and really had a good quarter, and I think that's very much a reflection of I'd say two things. First of all is the new products, the DSC and then, beginning to the market to TGA, even though that hasn't launched yet. We also had an easier comparison in Q2 versus Q1 in TA Instruments, but TA has been a very solid franchise for us, and while it can be a little bit lumpy from time to time as a reflection of those types of end markets, over time, TA has provided very consistent growth and profitability and returns for the company. And I'm very excited about TA. I've spent quite a bit of time on the TA franchise in \u2013 was just again there a few weeks ago, or earlier last week. And this Discovery series thermal instrumentation platform is going to unfold over the next year and I think should provide us with some good growth opportunities.", "So, while TA was the headline, there were also some other sectors within our industrial end markets that were solid. I mentioned the food and environmental business, which is a very global business. In fact, more than half of that business is outside the United States. And some of the trends that we see in China and in other world markets on food continue to underscore the attractiveness of that end market for us.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Sir, your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks a million and congratulations on a solid quarter. So, Chris, can you \u2013 maybe the \u2013 one number that maybe surprised me a little bit was the Europe being so much stronger relative to some of the other geographies, up 12%. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you \u2013 I know Europe isn't one geography, but maybe talk about what you're seeing in Europe? And then any early insights given your presence in the UK and just kind of what people are thinking about and kind of what's embedded in your expectations for the second half of Europe given the decision over there?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure, sure, happy to comment a little on those things. Yeah, Europe was a really good quarter. As you know, Europe is pharma heavy, and we really saw a lot of strength in the recurring revenues there as well as solid instrument business, and so I think what we're seeing in Europe is just a reflection of what we're seeing more broadly on the pharma side.", "As we look at the back half of the year, I tend to take at a look at the entire first half and not one quarter in particular, and while we're, I would say, optimistic generally on the pharma market, the \u2013 we're more cautious on the industrial and academic markets in Europe in general. So, I'd say, we have a balanced outlook for the back half of the year in Europe that we're really keying off of the overall first half experience.", "As it relates to the UK, we're in a unique situation in England as well as in Europe broadly, with a big part of our mass spec footprint in the region, and by the way, don't forget that we also have significant operations in Ireland. So, we really have quite an opportunity to balance a number of considerations over time depending on how the exit plays out, depending on how currencies play out, depending on what trade barriers or trade agreements get struck, what type of tariffs ensue.", "Obviously, it's way too early to make any calls. We don't expect the government to invoke Article 50 for some time, probably into early to mid-2017. There is a lot of posturing right now. The new government is just forming in England or in the UK and not really showing its hand. We've done some work with some smart people who are beginning to conceptualize a couple of different possible scenarios. But really it's a stay calm and carry on message in our organization. We've really pushed our team to just remain focused on what we do well and what we can control.", "As you know, it's a good end market for us in the UK, less than 5%, but a good end market, that's pretty well balanced between pharma and academic at the top of the list. But we also have a meaningful amount of R&D in the UK and in Ireland, as well as product costs. So in the near-term, we're benefiting from some of the weaker currency. But again, it's a dynamic situation and I'm confident that no matter how it shakes out, we'll have avenues to continue to be successful in that region not just from a commercial standpoint, but also from an operational standpoint.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks a lot for the color. And then maybe, Gene, just as a follow up, do you mind for the year, so for the growth rate of kind of 6% to 7% for the year, do you mind kind of \u2013 do you mind sharing geographically how you are thinking that's going to shake out now?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Certainly on a qualitative level I'm happy to. I think that the strength that we've seen in the pharmaceutical end market looks like it has some sustainability. So thinking about the average growth rate for the company, I think it's realistic to think that the pharmaceutical sector will be at or slightly higher than that. We're a little bit more cautious on the government and academic. We're expecting that we'll see some improvements during the second half, but that still has to materialize. And, I would say that we're also a little bit more cautious on the industrial side.", "So, looking at it from an end market point of view by application, I think we're most bullish on the continued strength of pharma, and a little bit more conservative on the public spending, and on the industrial side. Although, I think, for TA Instruments that will be a strong half given their new product flow.", "Another way to look at our business is also looking at the instrumentation and the recurring revenue. We've had a very strong first half of 2016 on the recurring side, that segment of our business has historically been amenable to trending. So, envisioning that the recurring business will be at or slightly higher than the average growth rate I think is realistic. So, that's some color that I think might be helpful to you, Jon.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Very welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, guys. Just going back on pharma CapEx or CapEx in general. I mean how would you kind of characterize this cycle versus prior and sort of where we are in that cycle?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Ross, I'm going to defer to Gene on this to compare it to future cycles, but I want to just continue to emphasize that this market is not static and is dynamic and is developing and I think is quite different just feels to me, I \u2013 from all the data I see quite different from the past. And, I think, an interesting hypothesis and question is, is there less cyclicality, if you will in the market now, because of the increased diversity both geographically of the customer base, the type of firms, as well as the type of molecules that are comprising the world's pharma pipeline. And so, that's what we're obviously continuing to dig deep on, but maybe Gene can draw a broader historical perspective on this.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "No, I \u2013 and Ross, you have lived through these cycles also, as you've covered the space. And as Chris mentioned, as we become less reliant on our top customers for a high percentage of our pharmaceutical sales, I think, there is a good argument to say that the cyclicality might not have quite as much of highs and lows to it.", "If I look at our recent performance, we've considerably expanded our pharmaceutical footprint in Asia with both China and India performing strongly and then within the U.S. and Europe, the shift to more generic manufacturers and more specialty pharma, also take away some of those big cyclical swings that we've seen with prior replacement cycles or with a big activity on the M&A front. So, I think, I'm just echoing pretty much what Chris mentioned, but hopefully that's helpful.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Well, I appreciate it. And just quickly, Gene, on the guidance from the original forecast, can you sort of breakout operational versus FX outperformance or differential?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, yes, I mean if I take a look at where we are year-to-date, so for the first half, we are still seeing a little bit of a drag from FX. If you recall on the first quarter call, we had about an $0.08 headwind that we dealt with from FX, and in the second quarter, we made up $0.06, so net, we're still $0.02 headwind for the half. Now, I think that we could easily see that go to neutral or slightly positive as we move into the second half.", "I think one of the factors to consider is to look at currencies that are outside the majors. Obviously, we're benefiting from the stronger yen, but there are some secondary currencies that might provide us a little bit of headwind to do some offsetting and it's on that basis that we're thinking that for the full year, FX will be neutral to the top line and close to neutral, maybe a little bit positive on the EPS line. So frankly, this is the first year in many where you're able to see the true ability of the company to grow its top line and to get operational leverage without having to cut through all the noise that FX has historically provided us.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thanks, Gene.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning, everyone and thanks for the time here. Just one clarification and then one bigger picture question for Chris. First, Gene, I wonder if you could give us a sense for where the strength in TA is manifesting geographically just as we try to get back to an apples-to-apples view on geographic trends.", "And then for Chris, within your thinking and the discussions around the strategic plan and what you want to present sounds like in 2017, can you give us any updated thoughts on what the binding constraints are, as you think about capital deployment? Are you confining these discussions and thoughts to smaller tuck-in deals? Are you confining them to accretive deals? Are you constraining any potential impact on margins? Any evolving thinking there would be very helpful. Thank you.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Well, first to say a little bit about the TA strength that we're seeing, I think it's very encouraging to see that we're seeing the most strength in our largest markets, including Europe, Japan and the United States. One of the things to consider as you begin to look at the TA business is the effect that we have not only from this new Discovery launch, but from all of the additional technologies, that TA has been adding in recent years.", "In the quarter, we just got a little bit of tailwind from M&A. Right now, our guidance assumes that most of the growth that we have from TA will be organic, as we look at the second half of the year. So, clearly, the markets that are most receptive to new technologies and material characterization, the more developed markets, Europe, Japan, the U.S. are the ones that are showing the greatest promise, as they quickly adopt the new Discovery series. Was that \u2013 does that answer your question, Steve?", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "On TA, yes, it does. Thanks, Gene.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. Stephen, just on the strategy process, maybe a couple of additional comments, and certainly, it's been a very energizing process for the team to build on where we are today, to start think about a framework for the future, and one thing I remind everybody internally is as well as I'll remind you externally is that, it's a process, it's an ongoing process of continuing to refine our focus on what makes us unique and different, and how we win in the markets that we choose to play in with the emphasis on choice.", "And, obviously the first question in any strategic plan needs to be a really granular characterization of what your core business is, and a plan to make sure we're maximizing our performance and our effectiveness in our core business. And then, obviously to look at things that we can uniquely offer to our other growth markets and gain scale in those markets.", "As it relates to the question of capital deployment and any as you said, binding constraints, I think it's probably premature to comment on that. The priority is growth, of course, growth in revenue and growth in profits. And, we're going to look at the overall growth equation and frankly try to balance some long-term financial objectives to balance growth profitability, the right investments. And, of course, return on invested capital. Return on invested capital is a big priority for me.", "As it relates to the role of M&A, I've been pretty clear before and I remain of the same mind that M&A is a tactic that we would employ only as a way to execute our business strategy. Our aim is to be primarily an organic innovator, and to not only retain but enhance our position as the industry's most vital organic innovator. We think that's the highest return on invested capital over time.", "And, over time, the company has, I think made smart acquisitions, but it's been not a regular part of the business formula. And so, I don't see deviating all that much, although I think as we look forward, we want to make sure we're taking advantage of all means to achieve the goals that I outlined.", "So, I think it's going to be a balanced and a pragmatic, and a disciplined and a responsible approach to capital allocation that is really all aimed at making us successful in our core business and very carefully building scale and other big opportunities that can grow over time.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam from Avondale Partners. Sir, your line is open.", "Sung Ji Nam - Avondale Partners LLC", "Thanks for taking the question. So, Chris, maybe if you look at your instrument business, historically I think for the developed markets, a lot of the growth was driven the replacement cycle of your install base. I was curious as to if you might be able to assess where that might be, or do you think there is a significant driver coming from further market expansion?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure, it's a fair question, Sung Ji, and we do have a healthy replacement cycle. Obviously in our core routine methods, there is a natural replacement cycle. I wouldn't say there is anything out of ordinary right now in terms of where we're at. At the same time, we do look to expand our technology into new work flows earlier in the development process, and geographically as more companies get in the game, particularly in some of the emerging markets. So I think we're trying to achieve as balanced as possible an overall portfolio of where our instrument platforms are used and, as we said in the call, also try to be very innovative, and in and the example I used in the call, continuing to emphasize the use of mass detection as a supplement to traditional optical and UV detection in chromatography workflows. We think that has a lot of value to our customers, particularly in some of the more complex larger molecule and bio type of applications, and we look forward to that playing through into more and more routine methods all the way through QC over time. And so that tends to be our focus, and obviously balance our instrument business with a very sharp focus on our chemistry consumables and our service offering.", "Sung Ji Nam - Avondale Partners LLC", "Okay. And then on the operating leverage side, one of the questions I get a lot is whether there's further headroom for you guys in terms of improving on that. And so, it seems like there are some initiatives underway and was curious as to what the additional levers are and what you guys are actually working on? Thanks.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure. No, that's a fair question. And I think, as Gene stated, now that we're in somewhat more of a neutral currency environment and you're seeing our top line work, you are seeing our desired model for operating leverage, which is first and foremost driven by volume and growth, but also consistent discipline around many levers if you will, up and down the P&L.", "In a broad sense, I would say, my goals are to continue to be a premier top line grower on this regard, maintain our price discipline, continue to look for mix opportunities, absorbing our cost with volume and also getting leverage out of our G&A, and ability to scale our sales and marketing efforts, while at the same time making sure we're investing enough and healthily in innovation. We've gradually ticked up our investment in R&D. And I would like to continue to do that as long as I'm convinced that we're getting high productivity out of R&D and spending a lot of time on portfolio management right now in that regard. And I am confident that we're getting good productivity out of our R&D. And so that's an area of investment that we feel we can pay for with a number of other levers over time. And to ideally achieve that optimal mix between growth and modest leverage while continuing to invest to grow. So that's the framework, that's the ideas and we'll put more specifics on that as we move forward.", "Sung Ji Nam - Avondale Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Sir, your line is open.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. Good morning. What percentage of your costs are in British pounds? And are there geographies where you generally have a stronger mass spec business that may be more positively impacted by the pound?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Yeah. I mean, just maybe I'll start off and Gene can develop it. Right now, we have somewhere between a quarter and a third of our R&D expenses out of our UK facility, and about 15% of our COGS. And so, those are expenses that are obviously well ahead of our revenue concentration in those markets. And so obviously, while the UK is a good commercial market for us, it's really an even more important operational center.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "I think you said it well, Chris. I would just say that, as you begin to think about currency moves, our ability to sell high-end mass spectrometry into Japan at this time would be a positive for us because we'd be leveraging the strength of the yen and the weakness of the pound.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And besides the weakness in Japan and the slight decline in the U.S., is the academic market weak across the board? And besides improvement in the U.S. in the back half of the year, what other geographical trends are you anticipating? In the academic market specifically.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, there are some developing markets that tend to be lumpy, that showed some positive growth in the quarter. Bryan, I would just remind you that much of our academic business is centered on research mass spectrometry workflows. So the business tends to be a little bit lumpy, and it tends to be somewhat dependent on our new product launches. So we're very encouraged by what our pipeline looks like from some recently introduced research mass spectrometry programs. And hopefully when we're talking to you about the third and fourth quarters of this year, we can talk about some nice pickup of these research platforms in the public sector.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Ma'am, your line is open.", "Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning. I just actually had one on the consumables side. So the launch of the CORTECS Columns, it seems like that's been quite successful for you. I was curious as you look at the growth in consumables this quarter or generally over the year so far, how much of it's driven by some of these newer proprietary products that you've launched and general mix shift towards the higher attach rate instruments versus just kind of per instrument increases? I was curious about that.", "And then, also, kind of I think you talked a little bit about this, but going forward, what's the opportunity for you on the consumable side in terms of proprietary products?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Sure. Maybe just I'll start and Gene can add to it. I would say that the current performance is a lot more driven by the second thing you said, Amanda, in terms of kind of a gradual mix shift in our install base towards higher utilization platforms. As you know, our ACQUITY platform, our UPLC platform has a higher attach rate than our legacy HPLC systems; and so, as UPLC continues to gradually grow in its presence in the marketplace, that provides us with a nice opportunity on the consumable side.", "I think new products like the CORTECS are still quite early in their phase of adoption, and so there is not necessarily a big tailwind that we're getting from that in the immediate time. But obviously that type of innovation with solid-core technology and the efficiency gains in \u2013 across a number of different workflows is a really attractive offering to the market. And we expect to add to our competitive advantage.", "Obviously, we have a large portfolio of consumables in chromatography and as you allude to, an increasing presence and interest in kits, like the glycan kits I referred to earlier, like ProteinWorks and some other specialty applications, where we think we can do even more. So, we really like this part of the business, we think we're competitively differentiated on the chemistry side with a significant chemistry expertise at our core. And we're only continuing to increase the emphasis of those development efforts.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "The thing that I would add to that is, I think, Chris did an excellent job in describing some of the product trends that we're seeing on the consumable side. But as you begin to look at the consumable growth and also look at the service growth, those two statistics are compatible with higher utilization rates of our instrumentation and also the increased number of \u2013 the increased installed base in some of our larger Asian markets where we have over a number of quarters exhibited strong double digit growth rates and these growth rates represent significant increases in the installed base, which in turn drive not only the consumables business as Chris noted, but also the service business.", "Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Sir, your line is open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just one for me on forecasting and how the inter-quarter dynamics are playing out for you guys these days. Gene, are you finding that as the business has evolved that there has been any change to the pacing of the orders such that the back-end loading in the last couple of weeks is not as heavy as it used to be or is it kind of the way that it's always been in that respect?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "That's a good question, Dan, and you know in recent quarters, we've noted that with the recurring revenue growth being so strong and with the linear type of ordering in sales patterns that you see for the recurring revenue. One of the effects there has been to take that hockey stick dynamic that we see with capital purchases that is at the end of a quarter and maybe make it less of a sharp curve. I think that the quarters where we tend to see more of the quarter end pick up are in the first quarter when people are waiting for budgets to be released and then in the fourth quarter when people are making sure that they use their calendar budget before the New Year starts. I can tell you that last year that fourth quarter hockey stick was just a little bit more tempered than it has been in prior years and another dynamic is just the increasing component of our business in Asia, where just historically, this sort of ordering and selling pattern was not as pronounced as it had been in Western Europe and North America.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "Thanks, Dan. I think we have time for one more question, Liz.", "Operator", "All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Sir, your line is open.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just have a follow up and then one quick question for Chris. First off for the follow-up for Gene, Gene to some of your other comments regarding the movement of the yen and your exposure to the pound, I'm surprised that you're not expecting an even larger positive impact from the changes in FX, given your manufacturing R&D exposure in the pound that has moved in the past four weeks or so. So I'm just wondering if you could \u2013 given that you benefited from FX by $0.06 here in the quarter, the pound really didn't move until the end of your second quarter, I would have thought that the FX impact would be even larger in the second half of the year. Then I have just one quick follow up for Chris.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, there \u2013 we did have a $0.06 benefit in the quarter for FX but we did assume that we would have a little bit of benefit. So that was the total. So, the guidance did make the assumption that we would not have the same currency dynamics as we had in the first quarter. So, as I begin to look at the second half of the year, and look at the total effects of currencies, not only the majors but also some of the secondary currencies, I think that envisioning that we can get someplace $0.05 to $0.07 during the second half of the year on FX. If everything stays relatively constant, in terms of the geographic and product distribution of our business, I think that's probably a ballpark estimate that's reasonable and assumed in the guidance that we provided.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much. And then, for Chris or Gene, I think you sort of alluded to this, Chris, a bit with some of your \u2013 you're working on longer-term strategic planning. But just wondering if you had any thoughts or comments as it relates to, you guys are continuing to post pretty strong free cash flow and you obviously have quite a bit of net cash on the balance sheet. So, I'm just wondering, do you have any thoughts on potentially stepping up the share repurchase program that you guys have been doing historically?", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "I think, Steve, that's a fair question, just as it relates to overall capital allocation, and we'll take your compliment that we are generating a lot of very strong free cash flow right now. Obviously, one of the challenges we have is where that cash is located relative to the ability to use it for kind of U.S. purposes, like share repurchase. I think we have a very well-established share repurchase program. We return a significant portion of that free cash flow to shareholders. I think at the \u2013 at a leading level in the industry, and so, really for the foreseeable future we expect to continue that practice and obviously, any adaptation to that over time would be carefully thought through and discussed.", "So, the question of capital allocation is a fair question. It goes part and parcel with our strategic outlook, and as we get further down the line, we'll put more specifics on all that. But thanks for the question, appreciate it and look forward to the continuing dialogue.", "Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors", "So, with that, maybe, Liz, thanks and I'll move to some closing comments to close the call. So really to conclude, as we move into the second half of the year, and begin to broaden our focus to 2017 and beyond, we are encouraged as we commented today by our first half performance. We're encouraged by the condition of our key end markets as well as by the strength of our product positions. All that said, we do live in a dynamic world and will continue to balance our optimism with a business plan that can adapt unforeseen changes in market conditions, so that we can continue to deliver reliable financial results.", "So on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q3 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on October 25, 2016.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "John Lynch - Waters Corp.", "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the fourth quarter and full year 2016.", "We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and those actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.", "During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussion of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release.", "Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to third quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.", "Lastly, as you recall in January of this year, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments Division. So, on this call and into the future, we will continue to refer to Waters products and markets and TA Instruments products and markets.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Also here for our commentary and the Q&A session is Gene Cassis, our Chief Financial Officer. As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results as well as some broader commentary.", "Overall, we delivered a solid third quarter performance with sales growing 5% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS increasing 11%. Growth was driven by continued strong performance in our core biopharmaceutical business, sustained momentum in China and reliable recurring revenues globally, offset by flat sales in our industrial markets and general challenging governmental and academic demand. Earnings growth in the quarter continue to outpace our top-line performance due to ongoing operating expense discipline, as well as positive foreign currency translation effects in the P&L.", "Taking a closer look at our business in major markets, our broadly defined biopharmaceutical market for Waters products and services once again led the way with 13% growth in the quarter. We saw this growth across all significant pharmaceutical workflows and in all major geographic regions. Year-to-date, our sales to the biopharmaceutical customers have grown 12%, which is particularly impressive in comparison to double-digit growth rates in the first nine months of 2015.", "While growth contribution can be seen across multiple and customer types, our biopharmaceutical growth continues to be strongest in smaller, specialty and biotech firms. This is further evidence of a steadily increasing diversity and balance in our core business.", "Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemicals market, grew 1% in the quarter. Global weakness from the chemical industry contributed to slower growth in both our TA Instruments and Waters product lines. Demand for food safety and food quality related applications fared better, however, with sales growing by 7%.", "Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 15% decline in the quarter, particularly influenced by softness in Japan, Europe and the U.S. As we have stated before, demand from these markets tends to be lumpy quarter to quarter. This past quarter, additional dynamics relating to the timing of order shipments skewed the results and we expect more stability in the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by low to mid single-digit improvements in Asia, excluding Japan.", "Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter, Waters instrument sales grew 4%. Continued strong uptake for LC systems featuring the ACQUITY Arc module and for LC-MS systems incorporating our bench-top Tandem Quadrupole technologies were highlights of the quarter's performance.", "Speaking of Tandem Quad mass spectrometers, Q3 saw an acceleration of sales for our Xevo TQ-S micro and the more recently introduced Xevo TQ-XS high performance Tandem Quadrupole instrument. These instruments are used for demanding quantification applications where high sensitivity, speed of analysis and reproducibility are required, whether analyzing small or large molecules, a single analyte or a panel of compounds.", "On the research mass spec side, more labs are adopting our newly introduced Vion IMS QTof system as the advantages of seamlessly coupling ion mobility and high-resolution top (06:25) measurements are enabling new research workflows. Waters' total recurring revenue, the combination of servicing, chemistry consumables, grew 7% in Q3. Breaking out our recurring revenues, service grew at an 8% rate with global demand for service plans continuing to increase.", "Sales of chemistry consumables were up 6% in the quarter with relatively balanced regional growth. Continued strong uptake for our protein columns and GlycoWorks labeling kits highlighted the robustness of our biopharmaceutical consumable sales trends. Additionally, sales of ACQUITY UPLC columns continue to demonstrate the increasing usage of UPLC technology in regulated workflows.", "Turning to our TA Instruments business, revenues were up 1% for the quarter with flat sales in instrument systems and 6% growth in service revenues. These results were below our expectations given TA's strong product position in the current Discovery Series launch and seem to signal slower demand from industrial chemical customers, particularly in developed markets. We will continue to watch these markets closely and look to capitalize on opportunities to address pent-up demand as it materializes.", "In the quarter, TA completed the acquisition of Rubotherm, a developer of a unique and high-performance thermogravimetric technology based on magnetic levitation. This exciting product line will fit squarely into our broader thermal analysis portfolio and sales channel and open up adjacent growth opportunities.", "Finally, looking at the quarter geographically, Asia continues to be our strongest region with 13% growth, while sales in the Americas grew by 2% and European sales declined by 1%. The strength of our business in Asia was highlighted by strong double-digit sales growth in China and this in comparison to a strong prior year's quarter.", "Within China, we saw growth across all of our markets and product lines with particular strength in pharmaceuticals. Looking specifically at our Chinese business with pharmaceutical customers, growth drivers included new regulatory requirements by the CFDA, which is China's Food & Drug Administration, which focus on increasing analytical rigor across key workflows to assure consistency of results and integrity of archive data. Our strength across LC optical and LC and MS as well as with our Empower chromatography data system has us well positioned to meet these needs. Furthermore, TA posted double-digit growth in China.", "In Japan, sales from our Waters portfolio declined modestly at constant currency with growth in pharmaceutical sales offset by declines in industrial, government and academic spending. TA's performance in Japan was flat. Revenues in the Americas included a slight decline in the U.S. against the challenging base of comparison, offset by growth off easier comps in Latin America.", "Our performance in the U.S. was a tale of two cities, with continuing strong pharmaceutical demand offset by lower governmental and academic spending. Pharmaceutical demand in the U.S. was strongest from specialty and biotech firms. Europe also saw strong biopharmaceutical trends, driven by demand for service and mass spectrometry technologies. Offsetting solid mid single-digit growth in Western Europe was weaker demand in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.", "Stepping back and looking at our year-to-date results, I am pleased with our overall performance as revenues have grown 6%, and adjusted non-GAAP EPS has grown 12%. Revenue through the first nine months has been solidly above estimated market growth rates, and the team has also effectively managed our spending to deliver operating leverage, while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our future growth.", "From the beginning of the year, we expected our big three growth drivers, namely the biopharma market, our China geography and recurring revenues of chemistry and service to all be sources of strength. If anything, performance from these sources has exceeded our expectations. And while our other market and geography segments have materialized somewhat differently than we originally expected, we don't see any factors that affect our ability to deliver the overall results we are targeting for the year.", "Moreover, we feel we are poised to benefit from improvement in market conditions in the industrial, government and academic markets when they occur. So as we look at the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core business and key growth drivers and are pleased that business trends in these areas suggest a continuation of strong and sustainable operating performance.", "Now, I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the third quarter, our revenues came in at $527 million, an increase of about 5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was about neutral. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the third quarter were up 11% to $1.57 in comparison to earnings of $1.42 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.53 compared to $1.40 for the third quarter of last year.", "On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 12% to $4.41 in comparison to earnings of $3.94 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $4.26, compared to $3.82 for the comparable period in 2015. Our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in our press release issued this morning.", "On the product front, our Waters products and services sales were up 5%, while TA's were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrumentation platform sales increased by 4%, and TA's instrument sales were flat. Our total recurring revenue associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 7% with TA service revenue up 6%.", "Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter and before currency translation, U.S. and European sales were down 1%, Japan is down 2% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 18%. As Chris noted, sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China. As for TA, global product sales were up 1% overall with mid single-digit decreases in the U.S. and Europe, offset by strong double-digit growth in China.", "Now I'd like to comment on our third quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.6% versus 58.7% in the third quarter of last year. The year-to-date gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first three quarters of 2015 with currency still a slight headwind.", "Moving down to P&L, SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and flat on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew 8% in the quarter on a constant currency basis, but decreased by 1% on a reported basis, this primarily due to the weaker British pound.", "On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14% versus 12.7% in the third quarter of 2015. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 81.4 million shares or approximately 1.4 million shares lower than the third quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Turning now to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.7 billion and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $931 million. As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 440,000 shares of our common stock for $69 million. This leaves $206 million on our authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.", "In the third quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $128 million after funding $21 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of investments associated with facility expansions.", "Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels were up approximately 6% in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.", "As we think about our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of approximately 5%. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to modestly increase the sales growth.", "Moving down the P&L, we expect gross margin percent for the fourth quarter to sequentially improve from the third quarter's and approach 60%. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled and will grow moderately from those in the prior year's quarter while we continue to fund R&D initiatives.", "Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $7 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at 14%.", "Rolling these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $2.08 to $2.18. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first nine months of 2016 and assuming a fully diluted share count of about 81.5 million shares, we now anticipate full year 2016 reported sales growth of about 6% and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.48 to $6.58, which maintains the midpoint of our full-year guidance as communicated at the end of the last quarter.", "And with that, I will turn the call back to Chris.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Great. Thank you, Gene. Before we open the phone lines for Q&A, I just like to add one comment. Since I started at Waters a little more than a year ago, the investment community has been very supportive and engaging as I dug in with the team to operate the business, build the team, and chart the future.", "Given my interest in providing you deeper insights into Waters and our future direction, I'm pleased to communicate that we will host an Investor Day on Thursday, March 2, 2017 in New York City. Preliminary planning is under way for an agenda that will feature presentations from our management team on a more comprehensive view of our business and future goals and strategies as well as an opportunity for Q&A and informal interaction. We'll provide more details as this event approaches.", "And with that, we'll now open the lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.", "Thank you, and, Natalie, please open the lines.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate your comments on the academic markets in the prepared statements, but I was hoping you could put a little more context. We've seen a few companies this quarter now kind of echo a similar pressure in that channel, and I was wondering if you could maybe help us reconcile. It seems like funding in the U.S. is better this year, but it's not translating into dollars. So, just thoughts on why that's the case and when we might see a turn.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Yeah. Thanks for the question, Isaac. I'll make a few comments, and Gene may want to follow up as well. And I agree with your point that we don't really see a funding problem out there. In fact, if anything in the broader picture and you see this in headlines and in terms of what the government is interested in and a number of different funding sources, there definitely seems to be a renaissance in medical research and other areas that will ultimately translate into spending in the academic sector.", "As I commented in my comments, the patterns here tend to be quite lumpy. There is less recurring revenue, as you know, in these segments, more oriented towards high-end mass spectrometry. And frankly, we have pretty good visibility to orders. And just looking at a bunch of timing factors around orders, I think that tends to distort numbers quarter to quarter sometimes. So, again, our outlook is in this particular area to be conservative and to be cautious but looking for opportunities to do better, and that's the way we're looking at it.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Maybe just a clarifying question on that last comment you made about orders. So, could you maybe quantify the extent to which delayed orders might have had an impact on that part of the business, either to total top line or to growth in the academic channel and should we assume that the majority of that translates into the fourth quarter based on your current guidance?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "I'd rather not quantify that specifically, Isaac, other than to say that we do try to calculate that and try to get a sense as to what the overall end market is capable of in the foreseeable future, and that's why we don't see this as a crisis per se but really the vagaries of timing and a cautious outlook on these markets which are a little bit less predictable given our revenue composition in the area.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Just a couple of clarifying questions. Could you clarify the M&A contribution in the quarter and the full year expectation? And then on the fourth quarter guidance, you do have two extra days in the quarter, if I'm not mistaken. So, that's sort of implying a general slowdown in the business from the year-over-year comps. Is that the wrong way to sort of look at it?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Derik, I'll let Gene comment mostly on this, but the M&A contribution is very small at this point. And in terms of the extra days, yes, there are extra days, but it's generally within the noise, and we didn't bank too much on the two extra days. So, Gene, go ahead.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "Hi, Derik. In terms of looking at the M&A contribution in the quarter that we just reported on, it was around 20 basis points of revenue growth. And in terms of looking at the effects of the selling days on the fourth quarter's performance, as you know from following this company for many years, the days typically affect our recurring revenues. And a good rule of thumb is that each day, additional day can contribute about a percentage of growth to our recurring revenues. And with recurring revenues being about half of our business, that would translate into a benefit of about a percentage point of growth. So, it is really not the caution on recurring revenues that leads to our assumptions about the fourth quarter's performance. I think our conservatism is much more around the capital spend...", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "...concerns about continued industrial weakness, and again, as Chris so well characterized, the government and academic that it's a little bit tough to call just given the lumpiness of it. So, there's a little bit of conservatism on the capital spend that's built into the fourth quarter outlook.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And just one final clarification. So, you're not expecting as big a budget flush in pharma then?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "Well, you know what? The pharmaceutical performance was strong in the prior-year quarter. The momentum that we see in pharmaceuticals early in this fourth quarter continues to be encouraging. But I think to assume that the pharmaceutical world continues on a trajectory that's close to a mid-teens rate would be something that we're not particularly comfortable with. So, I think...", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "...as we begin to look at our expectations for the fourth quarter, a little bit of moderation of that pharmaceutical growth I think is warranted, still very healthy, but just not at the rate that we reported in the third quarter, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks for the clarification.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg from UBS. Your line is now open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. Hey, Chris. You guys ended the year with just under $1 billion if net cash, and Danaher just bought Phenomenex, which I know is an asset that you would think would fit kind of nicely under your guys's umbrella. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you're thinking about capital allocation and use of that cash?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Sure. Yeah, I think the story on capital deployment, Jon, is very consistent with what we've always done. As you know, we have a well-established share repurchase program that we anticipate continuing. As far as M&A goes, I've been very clear since the day I walked in here that we will actively look at those opportunities, but it's not a core strategy of the company. M&A is really a tactic to execute a business strategy, and certainly, we'll say more about this over time including at the investor meeting early next year, but suffice it to say, we'll look at everything out there, but we're going to be very disciplined about those types of decisions. So, certainly, if the right opportunities presented themselves and they made sense strategically, they made sense financially, we'd be interested, but at this point in time, we've taken a more conservative approach on that.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "And this is my quick follow-up. I guess, as you look out there and you see some of these chess pieces that are moving around, are you seeing any signs, either on the instrumentation business or the chemistry business, are you seeing any signs in terms of the way your customers are behaving or any changes in the way your customers are behaving or any impact of what some of your competitors are doing?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Jon, that's absolutely the right question to ask, and it's the question we ask as well, which is, is there benefit to breadth in the customer purchasing process. And at this point, we don't really see any signs that that is the case. We believe we benefit from our focus and our depth in the particular workflows we're focused on. And within those areas, we're actually more comprehensive than any of our competitors, say, for example, in the five main areas of chromatography, mass spectrometry, chemistry, service, and informatics.", "When you look at that bundle and the workflows that surround those areas, we're number one altogether, and we've got strength in every one of those components but also an ability to put those together as a system for the key workflows in our chosen markets. And so, it's a very fair question. It's the right question and it's one we'll continue to evaluate, but at this point, I certainly don't see any competitive advantage from just having more product categories in a purchasing type of scenario.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning. Just to start on TA, what were new product contributions to growth in the quarter? What's current backlog? And as we begin to think about 2017, do you still believe the series of new TA instrument launches can help drive at least corporate average growth even if industrial end market challenges persist or based on what we're seeing now, should we tamper our expectations?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Yeah. Good question, Doug, and you've pointed out an important point which is that from a product position standpoint in TA, we're in a great situation. We're I'd say midway through the early stages of the launch of the Discovery series with the DSC and the TGA instruments in the market with still several more versions to come. I would say the contribution from those particular product lines is relatively modest right now and that the situation in TA relative to the top line is more reflecting of the industrial chemical end markets and just a little bit of sluggishness in those markets right now.", "We're extremely vigilant about trying to understand that and feel that whenever there is sign of life in those markets that we're going to do very, very well. That particular instrument product line actually gives us new capability, increasing pricing power, actually better margins. And so, we're actually in the general sense quite optimistic about the performance of TA and giving that particular product line a lot of support right now and just trying to manage our way through a little softer end market.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, a margin question. So, SG&A was flat year-over-year reported, up 2% in constant currency terms. And really that type of leverage was really the most important driver to you meeting EPS expectations in the quarter. How much was the leverage there? How much of that was that driven by revenue weakness versus true operational discipline? What's the sustainability of this type of leverage at the SG&A line looking forward?", "And then moving up the P&L, looking at the gross margin line, could you provide some more color on the puts and takes to gross margin in the quarter? By our estimates, the weakening of the pound may have provided around 50 basis point benefit and in spite of that gross margin decline, 10 bps year-over-year. If you could provide a little more detail there as well, that would be helpful.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Sure. Thanks, Doug. Let me make a couple of comments, and then Gene can provide some additional data points. You're right. We did get SG&A leverage, and that's a combination of, I would say, three factors, certainly a little bit of revenue weakness lowered some of the sales-type spending, very strong operating discipline, and this team, as you know, has a history of disciplined operating management, and so we obviously have the ability to manage expenses tightly while still making sure we're doing the right things for growth.", "And we got a little bit of FX benefit as well. I think it's important to say as well SG&A will be an area that we continue to look for operating leverage over time, especially in the interest of maintaining or even enhancing our investment in R&D. I've said before that as long as we can cover it and still get operating leverage in the P&L and as long as I'm convinced that there is good R&D productivity, I'm even interested in increasing our commitment to innovation. Being the most vital organic grower and innovator in the industry is an important strategy of ours. And so, I'm very pleased that we're able to get operating leverage primarily through the SG&A line, at the same time, increasing our focus on innovation and fueling the new product pipeline.", "So, I think there is a good balance in the P&L right now. And I think many of those factors are indeed sustainable, and we want to obviously have that type of philosophy going forward. So, I'll let Gene comment a little more specifically on the puts and takes in the gross margin.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "Sure. Thank you very much, Chris, and hi, Doug. Looking at the gross margin like in every quarter, there are pushes and pulls. And you're right that we did get some FX benefit in the gross margin line, primarily from the Japanese yen and yes, some benefit from the British pound. Offsetting that was some dynamics in terms of product mix and geographical mix of the business. Historically, TA has been a very high gross margin business for us and was a little bit weaker in the quarter. So, that was one of the factors that influenced gross margin. And we had a very strong quarter in the area of service, which is a little bit dilutive to the gross margin, but it's nicely accretive to the operating margin.", "There's been a lot of focus on the valuation of the British pound post the Brexit vote, and I just wanted to comment that we didn't really see the full effect of the pound's current value in these third quarter results as the pound weakened throughout the quarter. So, the average rate of the pound wasn't quite as favorable as it is today, but where we see it most dramatically is in our R&D expense. I think we had talked about there being about a 9 percentage point difference between the constant currency R&D growth and the actual reported R&D growth. So, those are some of the factors where currency affected our P&L in the quarter.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "All right. Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Good morning, guys. Just want to get back on the CapEx side and again, just I know we're not going to get detailed bookings color, but can you just give us a sense in some of the markets where you either saw choppiness like academic and government or actual weakness in Europe or industrial, what the cadences looked like in those markets and how you feel about visibility?", "So, what I'm trying to get a sense of \u2013 because it seems like you're suggesting a lot of these issues are sort of temporal. Are you seeing something like in the very early parts of sort of the booking cycle where you're feeling like there are signs of recovery? Are you just looking at the period at which some of those markets have been depressed? And assuming you see some shift back, is some of it based off of maybe a lack of political uncertainty? Obviously, we've got with what's going on with the Brexit and the presidential election in the U.S. kind of uncertainty. I'm just trying to get a little bit of color for how you're thinking about that cadence, particularly in some of the markets where it's been a bit choppy.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Yeah. Thanks, Ross. Let me try to add some value on that comment that you're making. I think overall, I want to reiterate that I think the approach we're taking in these markets and really separating some of those growth drivers I talked about, which are really doing so well, pharma, China, recurring revenues, and we continue to focus on those. But in the areas that you mentioned, I think we're being quite balanced actually and cautious and conservative. And I don't think we have a feeling that there is some major cyclical trend that we're heading into. I think we see the normal back and forth of some of these markets particularly at the later point of the year. I don't have any evidence that political uncertainty is causing any abnormal issues here, certainly from a Brexit standpoint.", "Our business in the UK and in Europe has actually been pretty steady. And just in the Europe context, while the overall number looked a little bit lower, you really have to separate Western Europe from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The Western Europe part of that business is, as I mentioned, is quite stable and even the UK itself. Same comment on the U.S. political environment. We don't really see any linkage to the current election cycle to behaviors or attitudes in terms of the end customers.", "We do have more visibility to certain of those subsectors, say, particularly in the academic world where we have a longer view into the pipeline. And as I mentioned before, without trying to quantify it, we see enough evidence in the trialing and the quoting and the ordering to say that hopefully, we'll have some opportunities to improve on what we did last quarter coming up here.", "So, again, a conservative and a pragmatic approach in terms of the outlook in those markets but really truly looking for an opportunity to do better.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "And maybe just quickly going back on the biopharma side, I mean, we talked about this last quarter. But the sort of length of this cycle is probably atypical versus prior, but there's a number of reasons for that, and obviously, pipeline success has been quite good. As you talk to the sales force, many of which have been there for a long time or looking into that customer base, obviously, on a regular basis more deeply, how do they kind of characterize sort of the staying power at least on the CapEx side of demand and how they're thinking about how the order book sort of maintains over the next 12 months or 24 months?", "And again, I'm not looking for quantitative guidance because I know we're not going to get that, but just more like anecdotally what their conversations are like today versus 12 months ago or what they are most keyed in on to sort of understanding the trajectory of that demand base?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Yeah. That's a terrific question, Ross, and that's exactly the right question, and it's probably the question I spend most of my time thinking about, embrace your core business, love your core business, and try to understand it at a deeper level. And clearly, this question of cycles in pharmaceutical and staying power of demand, as you say, is exactly the point. And I guess my perspective \u2013 and I welcome Gene's more longer historical perspective as well \u2013 but my perspective is the pharma market we see today and that we expect to see just feels like a very steadily changing and different type of market than historical, potentially with less cyclicality, more balanced geographically, more balanced from an end customer standpoint.", "I used the word earlier renaissance in medical research, but I think that term also applies to the drug development process. And we're seeing less and less dependence on the biggest customers, less and less dependence on traditional, large, integrated biopharmaceutical companies, more and more growth and innovation in the specialty area, the biotech area, obviously, on one end of the spectrum, a real growth in the generic category driven by rising patient access to medical therapies around the world, but on the other end, an increasing drive for innovation and increasing complexity of molecules that are under development and frankly, that have more challenging characterization requirements.", "I'm personally spending a ton of my time with customers still, and many of these factors are reinforced. And so, we're excited about what's happening in the pharma world and all of those factors, and we'll continue to try to quantify that and really lean into that. So, we're really maximizing our performance in our core business which is our strategic goal number one.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Maybe, Chris, following up on that last point, you had another sequential increase in biopharma. I think last quarter, you talked about large pharma picking up a bit. I think it was up mid-single digits. So, can you maybe talk to whether that trend continued? And then on the biotech side, how much is the strength that you're seeing is a result of investments you're making into that channel? And are you seeing any shift in product mix with the growth in biotech?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Yeah. First of all, as it relates to large pharma, I would say we continue to see steady performance out of large pharma. It's not our fastest growing segment but it's there. It comes in and out a little bit quarter to quarter, but we're certainly not declining in that segment. And actually, I think large pharma is doing pretty well right now as a sector and end market but really, a lot of the growth, as you point out, is coming from specialty and biotech and so forth. I guess, I've spent a lot of time studying this this year, and I think the company made a bet five or seven or eight years ago, something in that timeframe to really develop more application support for the biotech world.", "And we've used a couple of examples of that in terms of some of the consumables and kits but also the workflows around the mass spec product line. And I think what we're seeing is we've seen a steady increase in market share in the large molecule segment. The large molecule segment is growing faster than the small molecule segment in general for the future, and it's a very, very different market. And that's what we're trying to do is really unstack the stack and understand it with more granularity, what the demands are in each of these subsets. But I think our biotech offering and you see this reflected in our current products but also as we share more of our product pipeline for the future continued strong emphasis on this biotech sector.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then maybe one on Japan. It's been core for a while. Obviously, there's been volatility in the yen. Do you see things kind of bottoming out there or what's the outlook?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Japan is mixed as we commented. The pharma sector in Japan is solid right now. And like I said, the pharma sector around the world has been pretty balanced, and that's true in Japan. In Japan where we've been through a little bit of a cycle and saw it again this quarter with less spending on the government side and declined some pretty good size declines in that sector as the government has prioritized other national investments in the wake of some of the unfortunate disasters there. There are some infrastructure rebuilding that has what we believe temporarily moved money away from some of the research government-type research business, but Gene may want to comment more on that.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "No, I think that's very accurate. And as Chris mentioned, the pharmaceutical spend in Japan continues to be robust. The other thing that we're seeing is that, that is a country that is very receptive to new technologies, and the uptake of some of TA's new Discovery products is something that we're very optimistic on as we look at the industrial opportunity in Japan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then if I could just ask one last quick clarification. I think it's an important point. As we think about next year, obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the pound movement implications to earnings. It sounds like from your comments, Chris, you may use that as an opportunity to take up investments. Is that the right way to not actually think about it all flowing through?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "I'm sorry. Can you repeat the last part of that an opportunity to what -", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I'm just trying to think about given the currency moves and the implied benefits for 2017 earnings, it sounds like you're going to actually be taking up spending a bit next year. Is that the right interpretation? So, the currency moves may not necessarily flow through.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "I don't think that's necessarily fair to say. We're right in the middle of our budgeting cycle, and I think like history and we've implied all the way along here, we're going to be prudent and cautious. It's our goal to sustain very attractive top line growth and to deliver some modest operating leverage while continuing to invest in R&D and in our sales force. And so, I don't anticipate any sort of a step change spending increase program. We're just going to continue to be very, very disciplined about how we deploy our capital internally.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks for clarifying.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup.Your line is now open.", "Dan Arias - Citigroup", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Chris, maybe just some color on new products and the competitive environment and industrial. Do you feel like the instruments that you're coming to market with are coming at a time when your competitors are doing a similar thing or do you think you're a bit off cycle, so to speak, which maybe has your \u2013 the potential for your portfolio to stick out a bit for those that are thinking about purchasing?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "That's a good question, Dan I would say I'm still learning about the competitive landscape relative to product cycles and what they're trying to do. But frankly, I'm 100% focused on what we're trying to do and making sure we're doing the right thing for Waters. So, I don't know that I have a perfectly clairvoyant vision on your question. I look at what we're doing in product development and take the last four or five big products we've done like the QDa mass detector, the ACQUITY Arc, a couple of really great new entrants in the mass spec category with Vion and then Xevo TQ-XS in the quantification area and then the stuff on the TA side.", "I like the way these products are shaping up for the priority segments, these particular products that we're newer in the market with. And keep in mind, product launches in this sector continue to impress me as things that really deepen and build and scale more steadily over time rather than being quick hits. But you think about the key priorities around our core business in small molecules and technologies like the Arc and the advantages that gives us in a more flexible approach to methods in geographies like China. You look at the biotech development phase and the food safety area and some other things and the strength we have in the tandem quadrupole area.", "And so, I think some of the products that we're emphasizing right now in our portfolio are very much at the core of the most important trends that we're trying to drive in the marketplace. And we'll over time give you a little more visibility into the pipeline for the future, but I've had an opportunity to spend a lot of time thinking about our portfolio and working with our engineering teams to make sure that what is coming next continues to build on this momentum.", "Unknown Speaker", "Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, if we look at some of the M&A activity that's taking place in the chemical space, any reason to think that that's having a role in demand or the way that timing is shaping up?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "In the chemical space. I don't know. I think that's a fair question. I mean, obviously, you have Dow, DuPont out there, and those have been good customers for us. I haven't seen any evidence that there is some discontinuity in terms of demand from those types of customers. So, I think the industrial backdrop that we have been talking about on this call is something that many people have seen. It's across sectors and we're just trying to be very clear right about it and certainly not panicking and being conservative and cautious like I said but looking for opportunities and making sure we're poised to seize those opportunities because what happens when you're in a cycle like this is that pent-up demand builds, and we're looking for opportunities to get some big wins in that regard.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Very good. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick ones for me. One is a regional question. The growth in India doesn't get as much attention on this call as sometimes I think it maybe deserves. Can you give us a sense for what India growth specifically was in the quarter, what it's been year-to-date? And how the balance of the drivers there is evolving between some of the regulatory demands coming from parties outside India, and how much of it is volume and how are you thinking about the structural growth drivers (49:19) going forward. Thanks.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Yeah, sure. Thanks, Steve. I'm glad you raised India, we do tend to talk about China a lot as a huge market and a high performing market, but India has been the same category. I very much think about India a lot and work with the team there. Our growth there has been in recent quarters and years, really solid in the mid-teens. And I think that reflects a couple of different things. Number one, it reflects the vibrancy of the generics market in terms of both the Indian companies and the multinational companies that are operating there, developing generic pharmaceuticals \u2013 producing generic pharmaceuticals for the world.", "As you allude to in your question, the regulatory requirements from the FDA and other notified bodies and regulators around the world has been increasing. And so, we've done particularly well in that market and believe we built our market share position and actually have quite a high market share position in India based on our competitive advantage in chromatography data systems, i.e., Empower. It's a huge competitive advantage for us, it's one we continue to build upon and we're building a stronger and stronger foundation of loyalty in that market.", "The other point about India that I find interesting is that not only is India an interesting market from a multinational standpoint and an export standpoint, but it's going to become over time a vibrant domestic market as well. And so, the strength of our franchise there over time, the strength of our relationships and our team sets us up well for other new waves of growth in India, so India is a huge priority, it's challenging to be our third-largest country in the world after the U.S. and China and will continue to be one of our top priorities.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, Chris. And then just one update on the mix of the business to help us think about how to model going forward, I know historically the company has had a pretty healthy balance of revenue exposure within the pharma category between, let's call it R&D/drug development on one side and then production and manufacturing on the other side. Given that we've seen so much growth in pharma as a category for you guys over the last couple of years, can you give us an update on what the balance is there between those two segments of pharma and where you're seeing more relative growth and how you're thinking about that over the next year or two? Thanks.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Yeah. We're pretty well balanced between development and production, more 50-50 between R&D and then the QC/QA side. The QA/QC side, as you know is more oriented towards recurring revenue and the service and the consumables, whereas the R&D side, a little more oriented towards capital.", "We've traditionally been strongest in late-stage development and then QA/QC and certainly as we \u2013 based on the earlier conversation we had on the changing nature of pharma, as there's been more activity in development in recent years from more sectors, particularly specialty and biotech, that's been an area of strength for us. But we also have opportunities, we can do better in earlier-stage development and even in the research side. And we're excited about some things we're working on to augment the strength we have on late-stage development in QC and to earlier stage development in research, and we want to continue to improve in all areas. So, I don't know that there's been any drastic changes in mix, I don't think so in terms of our overall business composition between those areas. But like anything, there's areas we do particularly well and areas we can improve.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks and a good morning.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks. I was hoping to put a little bit of a finer point on the academic, government decline. In particular, you called out the dynamics in the U.S. as being strong pharma offset by weaker academic, but I think the academic piece in the U.S. is fairly small. I guess first of all, can you quantify how much of your revenue is kind of U.S. academic, government, and then, how much was what particular piece down?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Yeah. That's a fair question, Tim and we don't want to quantify all the different growth rates by sub-segment, but just in a broad sense, about 15% of our worldwide business overall for the corporation is government and academic. And so, to your point, it is a smaller mix. Within the U.S., the pure academic sector may be around 10% and it ebbs and it flows a little bit and government adds to that.", "So, you can see how a decline in these segments affects the overall result. And so, like I said we're taking a balanced view on one hand. We're not happy with the decline, and we want to do better and we believe we will do better. But on the other hand, keep it in perspective, and keep our number one focus on the core business and the sectors like pharma, like food and others that are giving us a lot of growth right now.", "So, affecting the overall geography, it wasn't just as simple as pharma and then academic, there is a lot of other sectors within industrial too that as we pointed out have had more moderate growth, particularly in the industrial side that the chemical, materials, polymer environmental type end markets.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And would you just mind quantifying your exposure on the revenue and cost line to the yen, now that things have moved around so much?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "Yes. Tim, I just wanted to mention just as a follow up to Chris' comments on the U.S. that in this particular quarter, we were comparing against a mid-teens growth in the prior year quarter. So, please bear that in mind as you think about the particular growth rates in the U.S. in the third quarter.", "And thinking about the yen, as we mentioned we had a slight decline in Japan on constant currency, but we had a double-digit growth rate at actual because of the appreciation of the yen, and Japan has been and continues to be a high single-digit percent of the corporation's business.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Good. I think we're coming closer to the top of the hour, but we have time for one or two more questions. So, maybe a couple more.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "Does that answer your question, Tim?", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yes. Thank you.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our question comes from Matt Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hello, good morning and thank you for squeezing me in. On the recurring revenues, at least sequentially versus the first half, there was a modest deceleration of the sales growth. I was hoping you could tease out academic and government instrument versus recurring revenue. Did that also have an impact on the recurring revenues for the company as a whole, or is that too small?", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "It's probably too small. It's good question, but probably a little bit too small. And once we start breaking our own numbers down in that level of granularity, there is too many exogenous factors to draw good conclusions but, yeah, I mean we did see a slightly moderating pattern there. But keep in mind earlier in the year, in a number of categories that continue to do well, we constantly, out of conservatism, expect some degree of moderation, and that was, as Gene said for the fourth quarter, even our best growth driver. So, these particular product lines or service lines, if you will, in the recurring revenues are a really core part of our story, and our competitive strength and the robustness of our ongoing business model. So, I think we're pleased overall with where that's at.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And then just a follow-up on the gross margin side. Is there a lag on the pound impact to COGS not just as far as the actual pound coming down through the quarter, but actually on when it impacts you? And then, in other words, like in an FX neutral or FX positive environment, how should we be thinking about the appropriate contribution margin on increasing sales for the business?", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "Let me start on that. I think that if the pound stays where it is today, Matt, we will get more of a full impact in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the pound devalued within the third quarter. And to your point, some of the positive effects of the pound on cost of goods sold are going to be dependent on just the product mix, and whether or not we sell the higher volumes of high resolution mass spectrometry systems, which are manufactured at our UK operation.", "And I have to say that as a higher ticket item, those tend to be lumped a little bit more towards the closing months of a year. Chris had already mentioned about some orders migrating from the third quarter into the fourth quarter on the academic spend, and that was mostly represented by \u2013 in our higher-end mass spectrometry space.", "Looking at next year, some things to consider is that we have had historically between 10% and 15% of cost of goods sold is pound-denominated. And probably more significantly, about a third of our R&D expense is denominated in sterling. So, those are some of the opportunities that we have maybe as we begin to look out into upcoming quarters to get a little bit more favorable impact on our P&L.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "Good. I think we have time for one more please.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thank you, Gene.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.", "Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Guys, thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Just two things for you. First following up, Gene, with you regarding your talking on the pound, is there any way that you can quantify what you're seeing now in terms of maybe an EPS impact from the weaker pound in your full year guidance versus what you were expecting three months or four months ago? And then secondly, just wondering if you could comment at all a little bit more color on geographic trend, particularly within China and the UK, just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on how strong China has been here recently and then also what you've seen in terms of end market demand in the UK since the Brexit. Thanks, guys.", "Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.", "Well, why don't I start out on the FX side and then I'll leave it to Chris to finish up on the second part of your question. Yes, we are enjoying a little bit more favorability in FX during the fourth quarter of this year than we had originally anticipated and to quantify it. It's about $0.05 more benefit across that period, more than we had originally anticipated. So, you're looking at $0.02 or $0.03 a quarter associated with total currency benefits in the third and fourth quarter.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "So, Steve, just quickly on your geographic questions to finish up and those are good questions to finish up, maybe I'll start with the UK and finish with China. We've seen very steady market conditions in the UK. Our UK business is roughly 4% or 5% of our global turnover, so it's one of our bigger countries, but it's also one that's quite balanced.", "There's a strong pharmaceutical sector there, of course, and also a strong government and academic sector in the UK as well and so that market is an important market for us. We've seen steady performance and in the near-term don't see any impacts of Brexit, but we're very \u2013 we're paying very close attention to Brexit. In fact, I've dialed up my participation in the UK and been there a number of times, including to key thought leaders in government and in other sectors, to really advocate for the types of policies that will continue to promote the life science industry in the UK. The ecosystem of the life science industry in the UK is very critical to us, to Europe and to the world and I'm actually despite all the uncertainty confident that everybody understands that and will keep the interest of that industry in mind as the negotiation gets underway. So, again much of that is out of our control, but to the extent we have a voice in what some of those policies are, we're going to be active in that process.", "From the standpoint of China, again we don't want to get too specific other than to say we're operating at a high level in China right now. I thinks that's a function of two or three things. First of all it's just a strong overall economic backdrop relative to the priorities of government. We're between year one and year two of the 13th Five-Year Plan, and we studied that very deeply and very well aware as to what the government is trying to do particularly around advancing and incubating the local pharmaceutical sector and rising quality standards there and rising data standards there, as well as in the food industry and the area of traditional Chinese medicine, those are three of our big priorities.", "We're seeing a lot of balance across those right now. We're seeing the rapid adoption of some of our newer technologies like the ACUITY Arc that really allow many of these sectors to get up to speed quickly, but also advance to more innovative, up-to-date methods. And so it's a pretty robust market, but I think one of the reasons we're having success there is that we've got a very strong team. We've been in China for a long time, we're coming up on nearly 500 employees in China, we have a huge commitment there. We're very active with a number of the key opinion leaders and academic centers there. I'm actually heading back over to China in a few weeks to dig even deeper because we think that what's happening there is very positive for our industry, for our business and it's at the very top of our list.", "So, anyway, thanks for that question and let me also now just move to conclude the call.", "Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.", "As we move into the fourth quarter of 2016 and begin to focus on 2017, we're very encouraged by our year-to-date performance. The strength of our key growth drivers has enabled us to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth through the first three quarters of the year.", "So, on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on January 24, 2017. And with that I thank you and wish you a wonderful day.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter 2016 and Full Year Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "John Lynch", "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.", "During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the first quarter and full year 2017.", "We caution you that all such statements are only predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in Part I under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning\u2019s press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2017.", "During today\u2019s call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning. In our discussion of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of such items - of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning\u2019s press release.", "Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today\u2019s call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Waters\u2019 Chief Executive Officer, Chris O\u2019Connell. Chris?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Great. Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Along with John Lynch, joining me on this morning\u2019s call are Sherry Buck, Waters\u2019 newly appointed Chief Financial Officer; and Eugene Cassis, Waters outgoing CFO who is transitioning into new corporate advisory role.", "During today\u2019s call, I will provide an overview of our operating results for Q4 and 2016, and will add some broader commentary on the business. Gene will then review financial details for our reported results, and Sherry will then provide our 2017 financial outlook before the Q&A period.", "I am pleased to report that we finished 2016 with strong broad-based sales growth across our major market categories and product lines. The quarter capped off 2016 fiscal year that featured robust organic revenue growth, operating leverage and double-digit earnings per share growth. In the fourth quarter, revenues grew 9%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 13% as reported.", "For the full year, 2016 sales grew 7%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 12% as reported. These full-year results were especially encouraging as they followed strong growth and financial performance in 2015. Taking a the closer look and starting with review of our market categories at the corporate level.", "Sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category grew 6% in the quarter, and grew 10% for the full year. The strength in pharma demand over the course of the year was driven by macro trends of rising global regulatory standards, increasing global patient access to prescription drugs, and the growing testing needs of newer biologic drugs that future ever-increasing complexity in molecular structure.", "Sales to our worldwide industrial category, which includes the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets across all product lines were robust in the fourth quarter, growing 14%. This category continues to be led by demand for food quality and safety testing, and was also aided by demand from fine chemical applications that rebounded from levels earlier in the year. For the full year, the industrial category grew 6%.", "Looking at our governmental and academic category, we saw a general rebound in the quarter with sales growing 6%. Growth was led by improved performance from academic customers in Europe, where we saw a notable increase in installations of new research-grade mass spectrometry instruments as well as strong performance from governmental agencies in Asia Pacific.", "Like Europe, the U.S. was strong in Q4 but negative for the year, which contributed to a full year decline in our overall governmental and academic category by 3%.", "As we have consistently conveyed this category is small and somewhat lumpy quarter to quarter for Waters. So we tend to focus on rolling trends versus any particularly quarter result.", "Now I\u2019d like to review product line dynamics, which I will cover by our Waters and TA branded lines. Waters\u2019 instrument sales grew 12% in the fourth quarter with LC and LC-MS platforms performing about equally as well accompanied by continued strong performance for laboratory informatics offerings.", "Looking at the full year, Waters\u2019 branded instrument platform sales were up 7%, a rate that reflects our strong product positions and the excellence of our field operations in a very competitive marketplace. On the LC front, ACQUITY Arc and [workhorse alliance] [ph] based systems for regulated testing drove overall LC system growth.", "For LC-MS applications, bench-top systems that incorporated our ACQUITY QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole mass spectrometers grew impressively. With thousands of installations now at the ACQUITY QDa mass detector continues to expand the adoption of mass spectrometry molecular characterization to the larger liquid chromatography market and user-base.", "Waters\u2019 recurring revenue, the combination of service and chemistry consumables grew 9% in the quarter. This rate includes the positive effect of two additional selling days in comparison to the prior year\u2019s quarter. For the full year, Waters recurring revenues grew 8%, marking the third straight year of high-single-digit growth. This consistent performance is indicative of strong instrument utilization, growth in service plans for regulated workflows and leading technology positions for advanced consumables.", "Our differentiation in consumables continues to grow with innovations in LC columns, such as CORTECS, and application-specific testing kits such as GlycoWorks and ProteinWorks. Additionally, sales of ACQUITY UPLC columns continue to demonstrate the increasing uptake of UPLC technology in more challenging biopharma workflows.", "Turning to our TA product lines, revenues were down 2% in the fourth quarter. Sequentially, we saw a nice pickup of orders and shipments in comparison to the third quarter result and the fourth quarter\u2019s modest decline was more a reflection of the mid-teens growth that we delivered in the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "From a product perspective, we saw increasing customer acceptance of our newly introduced Discovery line of thermal analyzers. In the quarter, we began shipping our Discovery Thermogravimetric Analyzer or TGA, an instrument that is often purchased alongside Differential Scanning Calorimeters or DSCs.", "Customer feedback in the new Discovery line continues to be favorable and our installations have gone very well. For the full year, sales of TA products and services increased 2%. This growth is slower than the business\u2019 long-term trend and reflected moderate weakening in demand from industrial end-markets against the prior year strong performance.", "We now enter 2017 with a strong product position, a growing business pipeline and some early indications of a cyclical recovery in industrial demand. Finally, I will review performance by geography at the corporate level.", "Asia Pacific continues to pace our global growth for the fourth quarter, while Europe was also region of strength and the Americas grew more modestly. Asia outside of Japan has been strong over multiyear period, and this performance continued throughout 2016, with growth in the high-teens range in the quarter and mid-teens range for the year.", "The strength in our business in Asia was highlighted in 2016 by strong double-digit sales growth in China, as well as consistent double-digit growth performance in India. Within China, we saw growth across all of our market and product lines with particularly strong demand from pharmaceutical customers.", "Looking specifically at this category, growth drivers included new regulatory requirements by China\u2019s Food and Drug Administration, which focus our increasing analytical rigor across key workflows to assure consistency of results and integrity of archived data. Our industry-leading Empower chromatography data systems has us well-positioned to meet these rising regulatory needs.", "In Japan, sales increased 6% in the quarter and 4% for the year. Growth over the course of the year was somewhat balanced between the pharmaceutical and industrial categories. Revenues in the Americas grew by 2% in the quarter, with strong growth in specialty pharma, chemical materials, and government and academic markets, offset by weaker growth from newer clinical diagnostic installations and applied industrial markets.", "For the year, Americas sales increased by 3% with balanced contributions from the pharmaceutical and industrial categories, offset by modest declines in governmental and academic business.", "Europe as a region was a strong contributor to the fourth quarter, growing 9% behind strong trends in pharmaceutical applications for both LC and MS instruments as well as service plans. Offsetting stronger growth in Western Europe was weaker demand in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. For the year, Europe grew 6%, impressive when considering the backdrop of economic uncertainty in a number of countries.", "Stepping back and looking at the corporation broadly, 2016 was a year of great performance and also great progress. It all starts with our 7,000 employees worldwide for it is our people, culture and values that make the Waters\u2019 difference.", "I want to congratulate our entire organization for job well done. The team works tirelessly and executed all year long. While we delivered strong financial performance in 2016, we also transitioned to our new leadership structure, advanced our innovation capability through development a rigorous portfolio of management process, and created a strategic framework to guide our continuing growth and performance for the long-term. It was a busy and rewarding year, and I feel very grateful to be part of such a fine company and team of people.", "In a few minutes, you\u2019ll have the chance to hear from Sherry Buck, our new CFO, as she outlines our financial outlook for 2017. Though Sherry has been at Waters for only a few weeks, she has already immersed herself in the business, participated actively in financial planning activities and contributed strongly in her new position. We are very excited to have Sherry and welcome her warmly as our CFO. Her background, skills and character are the perfect fit for Waters at the right time, as we navigate the changing landscape of corporate finance and chart our next phase of shareholder value creation.", "I also want to salute Gene Cassis, as he supports Sherry\u2019s onboarding and transitions to his new corporate advisory position, focused on technology and strategy. You will continue to see Gene, but I want to thank him at this time for a truly impactful and memorable three years as our CFO. I know everyone in the investment community will miss interacting Gene on a daily basis, but rest assured his positive impact on Waters will only continue.", "Finally, I want to comment on our upcoming Investor Day scheduled for Thursday, March 2 in New York City. Our goal as the Waters management team for this meeting is to provide investors with a fresh look at our markets, products and growth strategies. While much of what you will hear will feel familiar and consistent with our development to date as a company, our aim is to provide fresh new insights on our evolving global markets, our unique competitive position and our strategies for growth and value creation.", "Perhaps more importantly, you will have the opportunity to hear from our experienced and talented executive management team. I know you will enjoy meeting them, and I am confident that their remarks will add new texture to Waters as a compelling investment opportunity.", "Now I\u2019d like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the 2016 financials. Gene?", "Eugene Cassis", "Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the fourth quarter, our revenues came in at $629 million, an increase of about 9% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2%, resulting in 7% reported sales growth.", "Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were up 13% to $2.21 in comparison to earnings of $1.96 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $2.15 versus $1.83 last year. For the full year, 2016 sales grew about 7% before currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales growth by 1%.", "Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 12% to $6.62 per share versus $5.89 last year. In all, the impact of foreign exchange benefited full year earnings by about $0.07 versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, full-year earnings per share were $6.41 versus $5.65 in 2015. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.", "Looking at the fourth quarter, our growth was balanced with all of our major customer defined markets contributing nicely. Our pharmaceutical end-markets grew 6%, industrial markets grew 14%, and sales to global academic and governmental customers grew 6%.", "Product line growth was also balanced with total instrument sales growing at 9% and recurring revenues up 8%. Breaking that down further, our Waters products and services sales were up 10%, while TAs declined by 2%. Breaking that down even more, LC and LC-MS platform instrument sales increased by 12%, and TAs instrumentation system sales declined by 4%.", "Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 8%, with TA service revenue up 3% in the quarter.", "Looking at the full year, instrument and recurring revenue sales for the corporation grew 6% and 8% respectively. Now, looking at our growth rates in the fourth quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were down 1%, European sales were up 9%, sales in Japan up 6% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 18%.", "As for TA, global product and service sales were down 2% overall, with growth in Europe offset generally by declines elsewhere. Looking at the full year, Asia Pacific showed strong and consistent growth throughout the year and grew 12%. Europe was also solid growing 6% and the Americas grew 3% this over a strong prior year performance.", "Now I\u2019d like to comment on our fourth quarter\u2019s non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 60% compared to 59.4% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. For the full year in 2016, gross margins were 58.9% versus 58.7% in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, foreign exchange impact to gross margins present positively by about 60 basis points, and for the full year the impact was neutral.", "Now moving down the P&L, in the fourth quarter operating expenses were up 9% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a non-GAAP reported basis. In the quarter, higher variable expenses associated with higher volume and performance incentives contributed to spending growth. For the full year, operating expenses were up 5% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a non-GAAP reported basis.", "On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3% and for the full year 14.1%, this versus 13.8% in 2015. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 81 million shares or approximately 1.4 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. This being a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Now, turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term incentives totaled $2.8 billion and debt totaled $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $986 million. As for fourth quarter share repurchases, we bought 595,000 shares of our common stock for $82 million. This leaves a $123 million on our authorized share repurchase program.", "We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure plus non-cash tax benefits from stock based compensation accounting and excluding nonrecurring items that are unusual. In the fourth quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at a $151 million after funding $21 million of capital, excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of investments associated with facility expansion. This brings our full year 2016 free cash flow to $555 million or approximately $0.25 of cash flow for each dollar of sales.", "Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 71 days in the quarter, which is equal to that in the fourth quarter of last year and sequentially down 5 days from the third quarter. In the quarter, inventories declined by $40 million in comparison to the prior quarter, this is in line with our typical seasonal patterns.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to hand the call over to Sherry Buck, Waters\u2019 CFO, for further comments on our future outlook. Sherry?", "Sherry Buck", "Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m very happy to be a part of the Waters team. I\u2019m looking forward to connecting with many of you during our engagements with investment community in the coming months. Looking ahead to 2017, our outlook generally assumes continued stable demand from our pharmaceutical end-markets, consistent growth in our recurring revenue and balanced growth rates from our other end-markets. These dynamics lead up to a mid-single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2017.", "At current rates, currency translation is assumed to reduce 2017 sales growth by about 2% to 3%. Gross margins for the year are expected to be consistent with the prior year, in the range of 58.5% to 59%, as volume related manufacturing efficiency gains are expected to be offset by negative effects from foreign currency translation.", "Our plan is to continue to manage operating expense growth at a rate that is less than our sales growth rate. Moving below to operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $26 million.", "Our current operating tax rate is estimated to be approximately 14%, similar to our 2016 rate. Our 2017 guidance regarding capital allocation assumes continuation of our share repurchase program through 2017 at a rate that will result in an average diluted 2017 share count of about 80 million shares outstanding.", "Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2017 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $6.85 to $7.10. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to negatively affect EPS growth by approximately 4%.", "Looking at the first quarter of 2017, sales growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5%. At today\u2019s rates, currency translation is expected to reduce first quarter sales growth by about 2%. The sales growth rate includes the effect of two fewer selling days in the quarter that we assume will reduce sales growth by approximately 1%. These top-line factors combined with moderate increases in expenses result in an estimated first quarter earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.26 to $1.36.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Chris. Chris?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Great. Thank you, Gene, and thank you, Sherry. As we turn to 2017, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core business and believe the trends in our key business drivers suggest a continuation of solid operating performance. As always, when entering a new fiscal year we will strive for balance in our results and seek to cover unexpected changes in our assumptions with the breadth of our growth opportunities.", "Additionally, as we have stated consistently, we will seek to balance growth, operating leverage and investment in the business.", "With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.", "Jay, first question, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson of J.P. Morgan. Sir, your line is open.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hey, thank you. Chris, I want to maybe ask on pharma dynamics. It look like, you had a little bit of a slowdown there, when you take into consideration the extra selling days and easier comps. So can you maybe talk about what you saw in the channel in the year-end? Was there any kind of budget flush dynamics that you could call out? And then, what\u2019s embedded in guidance for both pharma growth and then separately for biotech for 2017?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure. Thanks, Tycho. Yeah, the pharma quarter as we talked about was up 6% on a year of 10%. So I think the fact that we saw fairly balanced demand at the end of the year is evidence maybe to answer your question on budget flush that we did not see any significant budget flush. In fact, we saw the strength in our business generally across the quarter. And most of the growth in the quarter came from the smaller and specialty accounts, as we\u2019ve consistently talked about, that we do have a broadening base of pharma demand that is not as reliant on the large pharma companies that have historically been a question of budget flush.", "And so, really you can see from the result in the fourth quarter growing more modestly than the year that we did not necessarily experience that type of flush.", "And I would also point though to the prior year where we had a strong pharma year as well in 2015. We saw the same pattern of moderating growth towards the end of the year. And so, when I look at the pharma performance for the company I really look at the total year result, which was that double-digit result.", "In terms of guidance and what we are assuming for 2017, to answer the last part of your question, I think we do what we always do is to be a little more moderate in our outlook and look at more historical trend lines, when forecasting a line of business such as pharma. And as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we seek to achieve more balance across our portfolio at least from a planning standpoint. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to be going for upside like we\u2019ve been able to achieve. But I think we\u2019ve taken a very pragmatic outlook in terms of our guidance that we\u2019ve given.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And just if I could ask one follow-up, what\u2019s in guidance for China and India. These have been big sources of strength for you guys over the past year. Can you just kind of clarify what you\u2019re expecting there?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Yes. Certainly, China and India as we pointed out had another strong year, and it\u2019s a strong year on top of a strong year. Those performance trends reflect the underlying positive conditions in those markets for sure, but also the strength and consistency of our approach executionaly in those markets. But again, like the pharma story, when we look at guidance for the year, we do look to moderate our expectations to set a bar that we can achieve and don\u2019t necessarily assume that everything goes right in every geography.", "And so, really when you look at what we\u2019re assuming for 2017, it\u2019s a moderation of the performance we\u2019ve seen from 2016 and 2015, but again that\u2019s a baseline and we\u2019ll attempt to improve upon that over the course of the year.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question is from Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Dan Arias", "Hi, good morning. Thank you. Chris, just to sort of drive home the point on Tycho\u2019s question there, should we take your comments to mean that the mid-single-digit assumption overall is kind of in line with what you\u2019re thinking for biopharma? I\u2019m sorry to ask the same question twice, but just given the magnitude of decline, I\u2019m just trying to get a number for the assumption on biopharma.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure. I think mid-single-digit overall guidance for our company is very consistent with the type of guidance that we\u2019ve given heading into prior years, again, looking at an overall balanced portfolio, not assuming everything goes perfectly and wanting the ability to cover changes and assumptions overtime.", "I\u2019d say that the historic rate of the pharma market for us has been a little bit better than mid-single-digits, more in line with the company\u2019s sort of long-term trend line growth rate of around 6%. And I think it\u2019s responsible to begin the year with that more moderate type of an outlook. But really underlying that is a set of market dynamics that we think are sustaining.", "We\u2019ve talked about these in the past and certainly conditions we saw in the fourth quarter continue to reinforce to us that those core drivers are intact drivers such as the rapid rise of prescription drugs in the world really fueled by generics factors such as the increasing research and now commercial activity of large molecule drugs that carry with them, more significant characterization requirements due to the complexity of those molecules and just the general rise in standardization of regulation around the world, and that\u2019s particularly fueling our business in the emerging markets like China and India. So really a lot of those drivers are very much intact. And again, we try to make prudent assumptions when we head into a new fiscal year.", "Dan Arias", "Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe within industrial, can you just put some color to comment on the early signs of potential cyclical recovery? And then maybe if we just look at the four sub segments that you typically tease out, would you kind of mind just of listing them in order of strength? It sounds like food is at the top. I would love to just get a relative sense for your expectation around materials, chemical, environmental as you look at 2017. Thanks.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure. Yes, I think our comments on the industrial sector reflect our own experience, particularly as we close the year. But also just the broader backdrop of what we\u2019re seeing in the economy. And certainly, we are seeing probably a little bit better tone in the market among some of our end-customers in terms of capital spending. Now, obviously, we need that to be proven in terms of orders as we get into the year, but it does seem like the broad tone is a little bit better.", "In terms of the quarter, obviously, we had a good industrial quarter at 14% growth, and actually 6% for the year. So when you really step back and look at industrial for the company, there were definitely puts and takes, but a pretty solid performance for the year.", "At the top of the leader board if you will for the industrial businesses, indeed the food environmental, those applied markets, which are really a reflection of rising testing standards in the food safety industry and the continued adaption of LC-MS technology. We have a particularly strong product position right now in that area with our tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer offerings and that\u2019s really a combination of the TQ-S micro, which has been on the market for several years, as you know, and the newly launched in 2016 product, the TQ-XS, which is our new high-end tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer.", "So we have a good product position, we have favorable trends in those market segments that are really leading our industrial category.", "The chemical, the fine chemicals market, the chemical materials market was softer during the year, but did have a rebound towards the end of the year and really normalized, I\u2019d say in the fourth quarter for an overall year look. And so that would be really the next on the list. And perhaps hopefully signals some stability in the coming year.", "The TA Instruments business as we pointed out had a softer year, obviously on a tougher comp, but reflecting really a broad year of relatively soft demand in the material science, polymer and metals market. But, again, we feel really good about the TA franchise overall from the standpoint of the product position that we enter 2017 with. And so if there is a pickup in demand in those end-markets, we stand to benefit as we head into 2017.", "Dan Arias", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mr. Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Dan Leonard", "Thank you. I guess, I\u2019ll start by following up on that last bit. Chris, can you comment on how TA performed versus plan in the fourth quarter? And would the expectation on 2017 just be mid-single-digit like the rest of the company in an assumption that markets improve?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Yeah, TA was soft in the fourth quarter and they missed their plan, and obviously we are not happy about that. But we also are putting the right context around that, which is they had a terrific quarter in the year prior. So they accomplished 15% type growth in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "As I pointed out in the prepared remarks, we did see a nice sequential improvement in the result in Q4 from three to four. And we are encouraged by the work they are doing in their pipeline. And so in terms of the year, we expect TA to have, we certainly model them in and around the corporate average, which is primarily organic growth, but we will get a small benefit from a small acquisition we made in 2016 that we talked about in one of the prior calls. But like I said earlier, we are really keying off of the Discovery product line as our main lever to achieve better growth in 2017.", "Dan Leonard", "Understood. And I know it\u2019s a smaller part of your business and you\u2019re not a great barometer, but can you discuss maybe what you are seeing in the academic market? It sounds like the U.S. is still weak and maybe what the outlook is there for 2017?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure. Yeah, the government and academic market as we talked quite a bit about last quarter is smaller and lumpier. And we had a good quarter worldwide. It was strength in Europe and Asia, offsetting relative weakness in the U.S., but nothing off the radar.", "And for the year, the category overall was down in the low-single-digits as I pointed out. Like we\u2019ve stated before, we always have relatively modest expectations for this sector, because it does tend to be lumpier and really more research-grade mass spec oriented. We do like our product position and to the extent there is an improved spending profile coming from those types of sources we stand to benefit.", "That market is generally driven by medical research where there is certainly a lot of interest in broad-based funding, and really is an interesting proving ground for the latest and most exacting measurement technologies. And so, we like the market. It\u2019s a good market for us, but it is smaller and lumpier, and we have relatively modest outlook because of that.", "Dan Leonard", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro", "Good morning, guys, thank you. I wanted to start with a question on just the strength in Europe and academic globally where looks like your performance was better than most would have expected. I know you guys are at the beginning of the earnings cycle here for the group. But I am wondering if you have any views as to whether or not market share was part of the driver.", "And I know it\u2019s hard to measure, but just seems like you guys at the very least might have gained a little share at least in those two areas.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Yes. Isaac, that\u2019s a good question. And I think I don\u2019t have a very good answer. Market share as you point is tough to ascertain particularly the further you get out in the world and in different pockets. I would say that we had in Europe a particular success with our new Vion high-resolution Tof mass spectrometer in some of the key academic centers. It\u2019s attracted some interest with an increasing perspective, I would say, on ion mobility in workflow, and a solid execution by the team. That was true in Asia as well.", "So whether we picked up share, it\u2019s hard to say. Because of the lumpiness of those markets, I wouldn\u2019t want to draw conclusions based on very limited data. But we obviously like the performance and we\u2019re going to continue to attempt to play with a hot hand and as the year unfolds here.", "Isaac Ro", "Great. And then just a follow-up on the maybe financial side with regards to margins, and then, Sherry, if you could comment that would be great. I know you\u2019re new in the seat, but just curious in your initial overview of the business anything really stands out in terms of areas where you could drive an improvement in margins? Waters obviously has been a very profitable company with great margins for a long time. But I think the assumption here is that there is still opportunity.", "So if there is either a category or a theme here that we should think about as you take the reins, I\u2019d be interested in where you think there is opportunity for improvement?", "Sherry Buck", "Sure, yes. So as you pointed out, there has been a very strong history of our performance and really as you look at the margins, we\u2019ve achieved historically, I\u2019d say it\u2019s really a factor of the kinds of businesses that we\u2019re in that generate those kinds of margin profiles. I\u2019d say, like all companies I think we have opportunity to improve in our operations through various efficiencies, and that will be one of my areas that I\u2019ll be focused on this year.", "Isaac Ro", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mr. Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken", "Good morning, guys. Just curious on the capital equipment side, it seem like obviously strength broadly, but how much lumpiness was there in some of the order of patterns? And obviously you didn\u2019t see much flush in pharma. But I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of - in the industrial and some of the other nontraditional businesses, how that cadence looked. And then, obviously it\u2019s tough to see any look into 2017 as we\u2019re only in January. But as your sales has had conversations on capital equipment purchasing, is there any areas you\u2019d highlight for us to monitor where it could be improving or decelerating?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Yes. Thanks for the question, Ross. The instrument category, generally the hardware category, was pretty solid across the year. We had in total instruments 9% growth for the quarter and 6% growth for the year, which is really right in the zone of where we expected and hoped to be then with the recurring lines giving some improvement to that.", "And what was nice to see, particularly as we came to the end of the year was more balance between LC and MS. We were little softer in the beginning part of the year in the mass spec business, pretty solid throughout the year in LC. And really as we get towards the end of the year, seemed like better balance, and that\u2019s in any time we see better balance, we\u2019re encouraged.", "In terms of lumpiness, I guess, I\u2019m still in the broad sense of the world getting to know the business and understand the different patterns. And there are always a lot of puts and takes. And so I tend to see the lumpiness factor within certain subcategories like government and academic, with more consistency in the bigger categories like pharma.", "And then really in that broadly defined industrial trade class, if you will, what I have been looking for is strength and consistency in the factors that tend to drive that category like the applied markets in food and environmental. And that was really a good story in the year driven by both a good product position as well as relatively healthy end-markets. And I think the trends that are driving some of those end-markets in the applied areas are ones that are sustainable, just because of the general rise of regulatory standards and expectations for quality and safety in the world\u2019s food supply.", "Ross Muken", "Got it. And just to be clear, on the operating margin side honestly, obviously a bit of a shift on the FX benefit this year turning obviously to a headwind. Just give us a little sense of what the underlying sort of implied operating margin expansion and/or incrementals look like, because obviously it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re getting much on gross?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Yeah, I mean, the gross margin, just one quick comment and I\u2019ll defer to John as well for any further comments. But the gross margin was relatively flattish. But keep in mind that a couple of key drivers for the business this year, for example were China and then broadly the global service business. Both of those areas of business tend to carry slightly lower gross margin, but they are accretive to the operating margin.", "And so really by the time we get down to the operating margin, one thing we feel best about over the course of the year was the modest operating leverage were able to achieve and the improvement in the operating margin really on an as reported basis as well as on a constant currency basis.", "And so, to get the 7% top line constant currency to reflect in double-digit operating income growth was a good achievement by the team and really reflected the mix of the business overall, rather than being too fixated on one particular line or the other. But it was good spending control. It was efficiency gains. And it was at the same time making sure we are making the right investments back into R&D and things that drive our growth for the future.", "John Lynch", "And maybe just add to that Ross, what Chris said, this is John speaking. I think that the major dynamic in margins for 2017 is that we are expecting a bit of a FX headwind in margins. I think other than that, dynamics will be similar to what Chris described.", "Ross Muken", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mr. Jon Groberg of UBS. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg", "Okay, thanks. First of all, welcome Sherry to Waters, and good luck.", "Sherry Buck", "Right, thank you.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Jon, are you there? I think you got dropped somehow by the phone. But, Jon, if you call back in, we\u2019ll take your question right away.", "Jonathan Groberg", "Hello.", "Operator", "It\u2019s the operator. The next on the line is Mr. Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. And maybe I just want to start off on FX and just what your thoughts are in pricing philosophy there and just more broadly what\u2019s baked into the guidance on that front.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Baked-in in terms of the overall FX headwind?", "Jack Meehan", "Yeah, I guess, just with some of the recent changes, whether it impacted the way that you think about setting price for some of your products.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Now, I would say that we tend to be pretty consistent in our pricing philosophy. We do try to achieve annual modest and sustainable price increases, especially where we demonstrate that value to our customers. So I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual in terms of our pricing policy or strategies right now related to FX. Obviously, we try to protect our revenue in some of the more volatile currencies through a combination of pricing in dollars and local currency. But I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything unusual heading into this year.", "Jack Meehan", "Got it. Thank you. And then I just want to follow-up one more time on biopharma, getting a few questions on it. And I was wondering, just pairing your commentary around biotech and some of the smaller accounts driving a lot of the growth with the 2% organic you had in America, just what should be the read through in terms of the trends with large cap pharma and just the confidence looking into 2017 that that can continue to sustain the growth? Thanks.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure. No, you have to piece apart the overall pharma picture and the U.S. picture to see some of the underlying points there. And like you point out, Jack, we are less dependent on large pharma. That\u2019s been a consistent trend over time, where 10 years ago 25% of our pharma business was large cap multinationals and today that\u2019s only about 11%.", "And so, it is a broadening base of that business and a globalization of that business. And when you really piece it apart, U.S. pharma was comparing to a tough year of 10% growth in prior year. And when you exclude the effects of some slightly negative government and academic and flattish industrial, U.S. pharma was more of a mid-single-digit, which reflected pretty good performance.", "And so, I think we generally feel good about the U.S. It\u2019s sort of steady as she goes. And we continue to seek the balance that I described, but certainly not forgetting about large pharma. It\u2019s been really our core customer base for a long time. And actually some of the most innovative work going on in the world right now is from the traditional large pharma companies. And we\u2019re very excited to participate in that.", "Jack Meehan", "Great, appreciate all the color.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Thanks. Jon, did we get you back on the line?", "Jonathan Groberg", "Can you hear me now?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Now, we can hear you.", "Jonathan Groberg", "All right. Well, thanks. I\u2019m not sure what happened. So I just had two quick questions. One on, I know you want to think about this Chris, but for QDa, can you give a sense as to how penetrated you think that market is from an adoption standpoint? And then the second question, they\u2019re both kind of detailed questions, given kind of the rhetoric going on in Washington, how are you thinking about, or what percent of your products are manufactured outside the U.S. today?", "I know it\u2019s a pretty significant percentage. And how are you kind of thinking about what you\u2019re hearing going on in Washington? Thanks.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure, sure, now, fair question. First of all QDa, look, I think we\u2019re - I know I have trouble hiding my enthusiasm of the QDa. QDa is a fantastic product. It\u2019s revolutionary in terms of bringing mass spectrometry to a package that\u2019s far more usable and integratable into many more workflows. The bottom-line is today mass spectrometry is used in far less than 10% of traditional chromatographic workflows. And so, you are only at the very beginning of mass detection. And this is particularly true as it relates to the use of QDa in mass detection generally in biopharma workflows as biopharma becomes bigger and bigger.", "And so it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s actually hard to put a specific number on percent penetration of addressable market, even though we do strive to do that, because the other thing we see is that new uses for QDa continue to present themselves. It\u2019s a fairly diverse range of uses that people are finding for it. And we\u2019ll put some more color on that when we get to our investor conference in early March. But we really do like the QDa platform and we like what it will do for the field of mass spectrometry broadly.", "In terms of the rhetoric in Washington, there is a lot of rhetoric for sure. To answer your question specifically, we\u2019re actually relatively balanced today in terms of being a net importer or exporter. We\u2019ve got a strong global manufacturing footprint with our major facilities between Singapore, Ireland, UK and the United States. And so from the standpoint of potential changes in corporate tax policy, we\u2019re actually excited about some of those directions. Certainly, access to our global cash would be a benefit. Certainly, lower rates in the U.S. would be a benefit.", "And operationally, depending on how significant some of those changes are we\u2019re in a good position based on that global footprint to move production to where it\u2019s most optimized to benefit the company operationally, but also financially. So we\u2019re watching all that very, very closely. I guess, I\u2019m an optimist at the end of the day on matters like trade policy. I think we have too much to gain in terms of being a global economy. And while there is a war of words from time to time among different countries, I think the U.S. has shown over time to take a pragmatic view towards these questions and I think the U.S. economy will only benefit from that.", "So I\u2019ll be an advocate for my chair in terms of free trade type policies and the growth of the U.S. economy as a result of that, which would only benefit our company and our industry.", "Jonathan Groberg", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question is from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Your line is open.", "Amanda Murphy", "Hi, I just have two quick questions for you. One, you mentioned the importance of regulatory dynamics and standardization, and you also talk about the Chinese FDA. So I was curious how much more runway you have on that specific initiative do you think. And anything else that is coming down the pipeline that you see in terms of regulatory changes or movement that could help in various different geographies going forward?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure. Now, it\u2019s a good question Amanda. We\u2019ve seen this theme in different markets. And, for example, two, three years ago, four years ago, we saw this trend play out in India for example as the FDA took a greater interest in on-the-ground resources in India and as a lot of these Indian generic providers both local and multinational began their efforts to step up compliance activities.", "To your point, we are seeing that in China real time as the Chinese government is harmonizing on the greatest common denominator, which are the more exacting FDA-level type standards. We think we are in the middle of that. We are not going to try to predict how long that cycle may exist. We\u2019re just focused on executing within it. But we do think at least in the near-term there is more runway there.", "I think this regulatory theme is not just one for the pharmaceutical market, but it\u2019s also there for the food market as well. And actually it\u2019s no coincidence that our food and applied franchise in China in particular has been a source of strength for the company. We do see over time more transparency in the supply chain for food from farm to market, and really the adaption of more sophisticated measurement technology such as LC-MS.", "And so we are trying to pursue those trends, we are trying to advocate with governments for responsible regulation in that regard. And we think we\u2019ll benefit from it. But rising regulation is also a trend in the material sciences, as new materials become introduced for industrial products of all types. There are all increased testing standards and even regulation. So we think this regulatory theme is an important business driver for us and one we\u2019re going to key off of.", "Amanda Murphy", "Yes, okay, it makes sense. I just have another question. I know this might be kind of generic, so forgive me, but I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit competition. And I know this is probably different in each parts your business. And I think mass spec historically been a little bit more competitive than others. But just trying to get a sense of, how you feel about the competitive dynamics at this point and who you are running into type thing.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Yes, I\u2019ll probably just give a simple answer to that, which is we think we have really great competitors. I have a lot of respect for the people we\u2019re up against. The dynamics are different obviously in different sectors. In LC, market share tends to be stickier for obvious reasons related to the standards that endure in terms of the methods used to produce, develop and produce medications. Mass spec tends to be a little faster in terms of the innovation cycle and a little bit more dynamic in that regard.", "And don\u2019t forget about competition on the service and chemistry side as well. TA Instruments on the material side faces a more fragmented competitor base than we do in the LC and MS business. But overall, I think we are up against smart, well-resourced disciplined companies. And I think that\u2019s good for the business and for the markets, and for the customers. So I wouldn\u2019t really want to say anything more than that.", "Amanda Murphy", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mr. Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin", "Hey, good morning.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik de Bruin", "Great. So just a couple of quick ones, and then I have one, then one long one. Any M&A contribution in the quarter? And last quarter you had a negative 15% academic result in Q3. Was there stuff that got pushed from Q3 into Q4 this quarter?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Yes. First of all, M&A was very, very minor, almost material. We had a tiny bit from the Rubotherm acquisition within TA, but it was almost not enough to comment on. Academic, yes, it was down in the quarter. We talked about that being sort of small and lumpy. There were one or two relatively modest examples of business that was pushed quarter to quarter, but that is also something that happens many quarters. There is always pushes and pulls.", "So we tend to look at that, as I said in the prepared remarks, that academic and government over a little bit more of a rolling period as quarters can, there is sometimes a lot of noise in various quarters.", "Derik de Bruin", "Great. And then just one long one, I certainly agree with that globally regulations going up, but there is news out this morning that Mr. Trump has frozen EPA grants. And he\u2019s talking about rolling back 75% of regulation. I mean, how do you sort of deal with sort of like the, I would say, the mixed messages that we\u2019ve got, wanting push back regulations in the States and then sort of the global market?", "I guess, the question I\u2019m going to is like how much of your market for - is U.S. based potentially be impacted by some of the plans that Mr. Trump is has been proposing?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Yes, first of all, I think the regulatory drivers of our business have a lot more to do with the emerging markets harmonizing on more global standards. I mean, certainly I don\u2019t expect - there is a lot of different types of regulations that I think people are probably talking about in some of those comments. But I don\u2019t think we have any expectation that regulations around the safety of medical therapies is going to be rolled back. I don\u2019t think there is any talk about that.", "I think there is a lot of talk about financial regulation, environmental regulation and some things of that nature. But there are lot of messages out there. And we just try to be a little more focused on what\u2019s in front of us. But I would say the two overwhelming factors driving our view of this topic are again the harmonization standards around the world, particularly in the Chinese and Indias of the world.", "And I think there is also an underlying consumer demand for safety, for purity, for quality in products of all types, whether they\u2019re medications, food or industrial products.", "Derik de Bruin", "Good. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from [Vineet Suda] [ph]. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. Good morning. Can you guys hear me?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Gene, and welcome, Sherry. Just of course if I could try to understand the biomolecules\u2019 dynamics, in the developed market pharma could you help us understand in the QA/QC lab in terms of competitive dynamics? You have biomolecules that are been entering the pipeline from the top from discovery and going through the approval.", "They\u2019re pulling in some of the competitive technologies into the QA/QC lab, where traditionally you\u2019ve had a very good position, very strong position. Help us understand a little bit in terms of those competitive dynamics. And, of course, you are answering that by your QDa detector. But help us parse out what you see that in 2017 and how do you see that going forward?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Yes. I think it\u2019s a good broad question, Vineet, as it relates to the - really the movement of a lot of biomolecules from the discovery and development phase into manufacturing. And there is ultimately going to be a technology set that may look quite different in that large molecule category than we see in traditional chemical entity type workflows. And this is why the company is positioned for that.", "You mentioned QDa and that\u2019s certainly one aspect of it, but it also starts with separations and the advent of UPLC and the technology advantage we have on the UPLC side for speed and precision of a separation science is clearly a key driver.", "I would also say on the kits, in addition to the mass detection that we talked about with QDa, there is all the work around the kits required to characterize various qualities or molecules, for example in Glycans. You\u2019ve heard us talk about Glycans and the GlycoWorks technology that it\u2019s been a real boon to protein characterization; additionally, our package around ProteinWorks that goes even further. And then I really wrap it also with the comment on software. Please don\u2019t forget about the importance of the data integrity equation that continues to impress us as a need in the market and the validated software that we offer.", "So anyway, we\u2019ve put a stake in the ground a long time ago. We continue to develop this particular thought process around how the biomolecule world will increasingly look different. And we expect to share more insights on that when we get to our investor meeting in March.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. And just one quick follow-up on the food and environmental comments that you made earlier, I mean, as you look at the food and environmental market in China, again, my understanding that LC-MS world being in that in past life is sort of the pricing is on the biopharma, and it is less sensitive compared to the food and environmental guys as they looked at the overall offering. Help me understand how you are able to penetrate those markets and gain share, especially in China, which is not only itself price sensitive, but again food and environmental being more - little bit more price sensitive. And you guys really have premium offering in terms of UPLCs and across the board. So help me educate a little bit.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Vineet, let me give you just a quick simple answer for that, then I would like to go to the last question as we\u2019re little short on time. The reality is those markets are still prioritizing the most exacting measurement technology and, we\u2019re actually able to maintain a price premium. We\u2019ve been hard at work for a long time with the government agencies to help define these new standard to analysis, which typically involve adoption of latest technologies, not price discounted lesser technologies. So we\u2019ll continue to try to push that trend. But thanks for the question.", "We have one more question, Jay, from the queue?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next one is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel", "All right. Good morning, everyone. First, I welcome Sherry, and second, I want to take this opportunity to thank Gene for all your help over the years and congratulate on the new role. So now for the questions I have, I have two. The first is on guidance, I was surprised that gross margin guidance was a little bit better given the move in the pound sterling. Can you help educate us a bit? Or are you embedding any assumption that product or geographic mix are a lot different in 2017 as part of the guide?", "And then, the second question is really on TA and the industrial end-market. I was a little surprised as well to see TA not do a bit better, when commentary on industrial was so positive relative to what we\u2019ve seen for a little while. I know some of this was attributed to the comp. But do you think there is also some potential that the market paused a bit at least for you due to - all the new products launches that you have coming to the market right now? Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in the queue and listen.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure. Well, I will take the question on TA, and then see if John and Sherry want to comment a little more on the guidance. But, first of all, - and thanks for your comment on Gene as well. On TA, maybe what you suggest is possible that as the market seeks to absorb new technology it does so in a little bit more of a measured fashion. But I think the TA performance really reflects what we talked about, which is strong comps and also maybe particular factors that are associated with the polymer and the metals type of industry that TA tends to be more focused on or better performs in the overall industrial category, which is really driven by as we talked about early the applied markets of food, environmental and those sort of markets that TA has some exposure to but less than Waters product.", "So, again, a little bit of the softer year on a great year before, but a great product position and we are hopeful for TA for 2017. So, any thoughts on the guidance?", "John Lynch", "Yeah. Hi, Doug. This is John. I will comment on the gross margin guidance. I think that would you get some benefit from the pound, but we anniversary that about mid-year. And what we are feeling some pain from is the yen and the euro for the full year.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay, okay.", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Thanks, Doug. And with that let me thank everybody for your great questions. Let me conclude the call now, please. So in conclusion, we are encouraged by our 2016 performance as we\u2019ve described, really headlined by our ability to deliver strong organic top-line growth, modest operating leverage, and double-digit earnings per share growth.", "So as we move into 2017, we remain focused on delivering operating results, and feel that market conditions and our competitive position support continuing success.", "So on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. And we look forward to updating you on our progress during our upcoming investor conference as well as our Q1 2017 call, which we currently anticipate holding on April 25, 2017.", "Thanks very much, and have a great day.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "John Lynch", "Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.", "Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.", "We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for January 23, 2018.", "During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro-forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.", "Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Thanks, John, good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Along with John Lynch, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, I will provide an overview of our Q3 and year-to-date operating results as well as some broader commentary on the business. Sherry will then review financial details for our reported results and provide an update on our Q4 and full-year 2017 financial outlook. We will then open up the lines for Q&A.", "In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, where we delivered solid revenue growth from each of our major customer defined end markets, as well as across all of our major product lines, well balanced between instrumentations and recurring revenue. Geographic strength continued in Asia and Europe, and importantly we saw another quarter of sequential improvement in the United States. ", "Third quarter revenue has been totaled were up 6% compared to the same period in 2016, which built nicely upon our consistent quarterly results in the previous two quarters of 2017. This Q3 performance led to year-to-date revenue growth of 6% and a very strong P&L featuring operating leverage and consistent double-digit earnings per share growth of 13% for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Additionally, we delivered another quarter of strong free cash flow bringing our year-to-date growth in free cash flow to 11%.", "Taking a closer look and starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category grew 5% in the quarter which is encouraging against a strong low teen base of comparison in the prior year. Our pharmaceutical growth was led by strength in large molecule and biomedical research applications. Geographic growth was balanced between our developed and emerging markets and we also absorbed some headwinds from the natural disasters in the Americas and meaningful timing delays in India caused by our customers' implementation of systems to accommodate the new goods and services tax protocols or GST. ", "Year-to-date overall sales for our pharmaceutical markets were up 6% against the strong prior year performance. Our ongoing strategy work continues to emphasize the vast opportunities in our core pharmaceutical business where we believe we are very well positioned to benefit from rising global regulatory standards, increasing patient access to medical therapies and growing volumes of biologic therapies that require more demanding analytical testing methods. ", "Sales to our worldwide industrial category which includes the materials characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets grew 5% in the quarter led by strength in material characterization. Overall, we have seen encouraging growth across applications within our industrial markets where year-to-date sales are growing 7%.", "Looking at our governmental and academic category, we saw sales grow by 13% in Q3 with broad based performance across all major geographies. In the quarter, we experienced strength in spending from academic institutions focused on biomedical and Omex research. ", "Now I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded instruments sales grew 4% in the third quarter and are growing 4% year-to-date. Within instruments, I would like to particularly highlight our bench top LC tandem mass specs systems led by our higher-end GVO TQXS as well as the workflow GVO TQX Micro. Mass spec continues overall to grow solidly in the quarter and consistently year-to-date.", "As we have commented on the past, we continue to see the expansion of mass spec technology into routine use quantification workflows primarily in food safety and biopharmaceutical applications. The development of our tandem, Quad [zero] platform has enabled us to meet evolving demand for reproducible quantification capabilities for both small and large molecules. ", "Waters branded recurring revenues the combination of service and precision chemistries grew 8% in the quarter and now represent approximately 50% of our Waters business. Recurring revenues were driven by global strength of our service, HPLC and UPLC application kits and our complete chemistry offerings. Year-to-date our chemistry and service revenues have grown at 7% indicative of high utilization rates for our installed base of Waters instruments. ", "Turning to our TA product lines, sales grew by 9% in the quarter bringing our year-to-date growth to 7%. Instrument sales for TA grew 12% in the quarter and continue to be led by our new discovery line of thermal analyzers introduced in 2016. This strong quarterly result also benefitted from the growth of rheology and high temperature thermal systems. We are well positioned to capitalize on market trends of rising innovation in highly engineered, high performance materials. ", "Finally, I will review our performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia, our largest reach in terms of revenue grew by 8% again led by China which grew faster as well as Japan. ", "Our China operation saw a solid growth from all of our core markets. Within the pharmaceutical category growth drivers continue to include new regulatory requirements for China\u2019s Food and Drug Administration. In the industrial category, China experienced strong growth across our materials characterization, food testing and environmental customers. Japan continue to benefit from strengthened governmental and academic customers and steady growth from pharmaceutical customers. ", "As mentioned previously, disruptions associated with customers, implementations of the new GST reporting system impacted our results in India in the quarter, we expect this situation to smooth out over the next couple of quarters, with continued solid overall performance of our Indian business. ", "Turning to the Americas. Sales were flat in the quarter, with our U.S. sales up 1% despite headwinds from recent natural disasters in the broader region. Macroeconomic and governmental policy uncertainties that we talked about last quarter, still persist, affecting general business activity in the United States, but we are seeing steady sequential improvement in line with our expectations. We are looking for continued improvement in the U.S. growth trends based on our strong product and market position. ", "Europe was a strong contributor to the third quarter, with sales growing 13%, highlighted by broad-based growth from our pharmaceutical customers, across product categories and throughout the region. ", "We saw strength in bio-pharma applications where we are well positioned with our targeted LCMS and a bio-molecule separation solution. We also saw strong service revenue from our large and growing base of installed systems. ", "Commenting further on Europe, I was able to spend to sometime in the region this quarter with customers and employees. In addition to a deep dive into our high potential Eastern European operations, a highlight of this trip was my visit to the Water separation in Brasov Romania. The Brasov team has grown steadily over the years, into one of our top operational sites worldwide, recently this site became Waters Informatics Center of Excellence, supporting development of our Empower Chromatography Data Systems, Unified Software Technology and New Genesis Lab Management System as well as the development of LCMS and TA instrument drivers. During my visit we dedicated a modern new facility designed to enable collaboration and innovation. Our informatics offering is a key differentiator for Waters and Brasov is a significant contributor to this strength. ", "So, as we head into the home stretch of 2017, I am pleased with the consistent top line and bottom line results the company has delivered for the first three quarters of the year. ", "We also remain steadfastly focused on our five-point value creation model. As I have constituently communicated, we aim to create shareholder value by first holding a unique and highly differentiated position in structurally attractive markets. Second, executing a clear growth strategy driven by organic innovation. Third, seeking opportunity for continuous operational improvement. Fourth, being a disciplined capital allocator and fifth operating with a performance oriented culture and management team. ", "Finally, I\u2019d like to comment on last week's announcement regarding the retirement of Doug Berthiaume as Chairman of the Board of Directors and my election as the new Chairman effective January 1, 2018. You all know Doug, as a visionary leader, who built the modern Water\u2019s and created significant value for shareholders. His achievements as Chairman and CEO have profoundly impacted our customers, employees, shareholders and the broader community. During the past two years in his role as Non-Executive Chairman, Doug has been invaluable mentor for me and orchestrated a smooth and productive transition. On a personal level, I am grateful for his example and his support and we\u2019ll continue to utilize him for advice and counsel. ", "More broadly in my view, Waters has always been a model for good corporate governance with a rigorous cadence to Board meetings, robust transparency practices and a strong lead independent director. As part of this, I am pleased that Tom Salice will continue in his position as lead Director working very closely with to sustain and continuously enhance our governance practices. ", "Furthermore, I will continue our efforts underway to ensure the optimal mix of backgrounds and capabilities for our Directors to our ongoing board development program. This initiative has already resulted in the recruitment of Dr. Flemming Ornskov, CEO of Shire Pharmaceuticals as a new Director of Waters. Flemming has now participated in two board meetings and has added valuable new insights to the Board and management team. I look forward to continuing to develop our Board, to ensure the highest possible quality and effectiveness of our governance practices. ", "With that, I\u2019d like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of our third quarter financials. Sherry?", "Sherry Buck ", "Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. We recorded net sales in the third quarter of $566 million, an increase of about 6% before currency translation which increased sales growth in the quarter by about 1% and results again 7% reported sales growth. In the quarter, pharmaceutical markets grew 5%, our industrial markets also grew 5% and sales to academic and governmental customers were up 13%. Product line growth was strongest in our recurring revenue with the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue growing 7% while instrument sales grew 5% in the quarter. ", "Breaking that down further, sales relating to Waters' branded products and services were up 6% while TA's grew 9%. Combined LC and LCMS instrument platform sales increased by 4% and TA\u2019s instrumentation system sales grew 12% as we continue to see the benefits of new product introduction. Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 7%. ", "Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter geographically, and before currency translation, sales in the Americas were flat with sales in the US increasing 1%. European sales were up 13%. Sales in Asia were up 8% led by strong growth in China and Japan. ", "Now I would like to comment on our third quarter non-GAAP performance versus the prior year. Growth margins for the quarter were steady coming in at 58.3%. Positive mix dynamics and product manufacturing efficiencies were offset by approximately 30 basis points of currency headwinds from higher cost as a result of the UK pound and the euro.", "Moving down the third quarter\u2019s P&L. Operating expenses were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency translation increased the operating expense growth by about 1% on a reported basis. Year-to-date sales have grown about 1% faster than operating expenses. On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate before effects of the new stock compensation rule for the quarter was about 14%.", "This is the result of the mix of the legal entity process in the quarter. Including a $0.03 benefit from new stock option accounting rules, the non-GAAP effective operating tax rate was about 12%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $5 million down about $1 million from year. Our average share count came in at 80.5 million shares or approximately 900,000 shares lower than in the third quarter last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program. ", "During the third quarter, we bought 4,37,500 shares of our common stock for $79 million. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the third quarter were up 13% to $1.77, in comparison to earnings of a $1.57 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.69, versus $1.53 last year. both our non-GAAP and GAAP earnings included benefit of $0.03 resulting from the new stock compensation accounting rules. ", "The impacts of foreign currency translation in the quarter on earnings per share were a positive $0.01. keeping the year-to-date impact about neutral. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release, issued this morning. ", "Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $3.3 billion and debt totaled $2 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $1.3 billion. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the third quarter of 2017, cash flow was strong and came in at $134 million after funding $20 million of capital expenditures. Modest improvements in working capital efficiency and disciplined capital spending contributed to our cash generation. This represents both a strong quarterly performance and year-to-date growth of approximately 11%. ", "Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 73 days this quarter, which is down two days from the second quarter of this year and three days compared to Q3 of last year. In the quarter inventories were approximately $298 million compared to $303 million in the third quarter of the prior year which was in line with our expectations. ", "As we look forward to the balance of the year, I\u2019d like to share our full year and fourth quarter 2017 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes continued global growth and demand from our end markets and consistent growth in our recurring revenue. Bringing this altogether we continue to expect constant currency sales to increase 5% to 6% for the full year. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to be neutral for the full year. ", "Out outlook for gross margins for the year is consistent with our previous guidance, in the range of 58.5% to 59%. Higher volume and manufacturing efficiency gains are expected to continue to be offset by negative effects from foreign currency translation. Our plan for the year is to continue managing operating expense growth at a rate that is less than our sales growth. ", "Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $22 million. We estimate our full year tax rate including an expected benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.19 due to new stock option accounting rules, to be about 12%. This is comprised of approximately $0.17 benefit realized year-to-date plus an assumed amount of $0.02 in the fourth quarter of this year. ", "Quarter-to-quarter variation will reflect the timing of actual stock option exercises and our stock price. We continue to provide a reconciliation of this item with remainder of 2017. ", "Our guidance regarding capital allocation assumes continuation of our share repurchase program for 2017, at a rate that will results an average diluted share count of about 80 million shares outstanding. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2017 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $7.38 to $7.48. At current rates, the foreign currency impact on full year earnings per share growth is expected to be about neutral. ", "Looking at the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect constant currency sales growth in the range of 3 to 5% against a very strong basic comparison as well as another quarter of likely impact from hurricane affected areas. ", "At today\u2019s rates, currency translation is expected to positively impact fourth quarter sales growth by about 2 to 3%. Combining these top line factors with a moderate increase in expenses and assumed $0.02 of tax benefit due to the new accounting standard, we estimate fourth quarter earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.38 to $2.48. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Chris. Chris?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Great, thank you Sherry. As we move into the fourth quarter, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core businesses and delivering on our operating performance objectives. As we have stated, we will seek the balance growth, operating leverage and investment in the business. With that, we will now open phone lines for Q&A. we are rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s question, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and if you have additional questions after the call, please contact our Investor Relations team. Operator, may we have the first question please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Tim Evans", "Hi, thank you. Can you perhaps give us a sense for how big the hurricane impact and the India GST impact was in the quarter and maybe also hope that you\u2019re expecting at least for Q4. ", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure Tim, thanks for the question. We estimate that these one-timers that we refer to in the call hit our top line growth rate by about 1% and that was roughly equally split between the natural disasters in the Americas region and the India GST but as we commented, those factors will look a little bit different in the fourth quarter. We think that the India GST situation is working through as we speak and you know while we may not be completely out of the woods, we expect to recover that business steadily over the coming two or three quarters and that\u2019s really simply a delay in orders and shipments. ", "From a natural disaster standpoint, it was really the US that took the majority of the hit in the third quarter where some of that risk shifts to Latin America for the fourth quarter but you know hopefully the impact will be somewhat less in Q4 than we saw in Q3. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question coming is from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hey Thanks. Chris, I want to ask a little bit about kind of the bifurcation growth you\u2019re seeing out of Europe versus the US. You know the particular sub-segments in Europe that are driving 30% growth this quarter, I mean that certainly stands out and then conversely here in the US, I noticed it does feel slow a little bit sequentially versus an easier comp. Is that kind of dragging down the US market?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure, yes. Thanks, Tycho for the question. There is definitely a bifurcation as you pointed out between the US and Europe and you know I\u2019ll first make a comment more on the pharmaceutical business. As you know the pharma business is a very global business and clearly what our experience here and sort of the short-term we are seeing the larger multinational pharma company is favoring. The more friendly operating environment in Europe, right now and that\u2019s obviously driven by more and more certain environment on tax and regulation and trade. ", "And so, the U.S. does feel like its bending a little bit of wait and see mode, but like we said in the call, we definitely saw a sequential improvement in that tone in the U.S. certainly Q2 was better than Q1 and Q3 was better than Q2, so hopefully we\u2019re stepping out of that and as you know sometimes these companies have cycled their purchasing activity between the U.S. and Europe and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re seeing right now. ", "In the industrial sector, we actually saw a growth in both the U.S. and in Europe, which was encouraging. Our industrial performance is pretty broad-based right now, and in academic and government we also saw a growth in both the U.S and in Europe. So really the U.S. versus Europe question is really trading-off pharma demand but like we said we\u2019re very encouraged with pharma demand overall, we think pharma demand is healthy, despite the near-term U.S. shift and the pharma growth that we saw in the quarter was obviously on tough comps as well as absorbing some of those one-timers that we just spoke about a few minutes ago. ", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I know on biopharma, if you could just comment a little bit on where you are feeling better or worse, I know you like to talk about the increasingly broad customer base there and I know you highlighted large molecule but we get a lot of questions on the generic side given some of the headlines there, so I am wondering if you can comment on, what you are hearing from those customers as well?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yes, I think a lot of the themes that we saw in the quarter, Tycho were pretty similar to what we have been seeing all year and what I have been seeing over the past couple of years, the demand in generics is good. There is obviously some headlines with some bigger companies out there, but again keeping in mind that even in some of the larger generics companies that have had some difficulty, our business is much more a function of volume and production than it is about say new initiatives. ", "But the generics market is very broad based, certainly the Indian business has been consistently strong despite the short-term dislocations with system implementation and GST and the U.S. continues to see new investment in generic categories from startup companies and mid-sized companies. And as I alluded into the call, the biopharma market has been really solid again, we continue to see the majority of the innovator companies focusing their investments on new analytical techniques for biopharma and as you heard at our analyst day and in subsequent investor conversations, we continue to highlight our strategy to win in that environment. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is coming from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Dan Leonard", "Thank you, Chris how are you thinking about the opportunity on the margin side as you head into 2018?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "Sure, margin is as I pointed out in the call on the value creation model, our margin philosophy and approach is to look for continuous improvement, obviously we operate at strong margins. As I said before, I think our margin profile is a unique reflection of our business model, and the concentration we have in highly attractive end markets and technologies and it's not a reflection of being optimized in any way and so we have a strong operational improvement initiative underway, where we think we can achieve modest ongoing operational improvements. ", "If you look at our P&L year-to-date, we\u2019ve delivered operating leverage in the quarter and year-to-date on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis and so I think that mentality is going to continue into \u201918. We\u2019re not giving guidance on \u201918 yet and we\u2019ll certainly do that in the January call. But we will be looking at another solid year of revenue and looking to drive some modest operating improvements while continuing to invest in future growth particularly in R&D.", "Maybe I\u2019ll take a moment while you raise that just to comment but one of the things I like most about our P&L both quarter-to-date and year-to-date is that we\u2019ve achieved a really nice leverage on the SG&A line while investing in R&D our year-to-date R&D investment on a constant currency basis is up about 10%. I mean that\u2019s really a reflection of our strong desire to continue to lead the industry and organic innovation.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question coming is from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin", "Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. The first one Sherry just a question I mean you\u2019re doing a $0.19 tailwind from the stock based comp this year. I guess can you talk about how you\u2019re looking at what that would translate over into \u201918 and obviously the follow-up question I mean there is obviously there is tax reform you\u2019re going to be able to repatriate some cash. Can you sort of talk about what cash is overseas and sort of what your initial thoughts would be, I assume you would use some of that to buy back shares to help offset this? What are the dynamics on the questions posed?", "Sherry Buck", "Sure, that\u2019s a really good question on the stock compensation impact for next year and I'd say it\u2019s a little bit too early as Chris talked about for our guidance for 2018. Probably the best comments here I can provide is we\u2019re looking at better operating tax rate and we would expect that to remain consistent in the mid-teens as you\u2019ve seen this year. ", "And then switching to your next question on tax reform, as we shared with our team internally looking at the tax reform and we have an ad hoc finance committee meeting that is helping us also in this arena. And for us we have a lot of optionality and we obviously would look to continue our share repurchase program but it will free up quite a bit of cash on our balance sheet and as we think about deploying that and looking to invest in the business is important to us and looking at our debt profile as well as return to shareholders. And we think we have a lot of options and we\u2019re going to watch closely with the details of the tax reform emerges and put a fine point on it when we have some more details. I don\u2019t know Chris if you\u2019d like to add anything else?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "That\u2019s well said Sherry. ", "Derik de Bruin", "Okay, a follow-up question. Just wanted you to walk through the EPS bridge for the full year. It looks by my math, you're about a negative 2% FX headwind before and then now you\u2019re talking about initial lines of benefits it's like a $0.14 increase by my math and then you know obviously the increases sort of full year is not as high as we would have thought sort of based upon that math. I guess what\u2019s going on with the underlying business. It looks like it\u2019s a little bit lark, just walk through the EPS bridge.", "Sherry Buck ", "Yeah, so we're looking at the EPS bridge, basically as we look at our guidance, we\u2019re following through our Q3 and just a little bit of the FX and as Chris mentioned earlier, we\u2019re taking some of the FX upside and investing in the business through R&D year-to-date up about 10% on a constant currency basis, so really trying to balance the benefit of some of the operating leverage and investing in the business. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is now open.", "Doug Schenkel ", "Good morning. What was core revenue growth by each sub-segment within the food, environmental and core industrial category and could you provide any relevant details on trends within each sub-segment by geography?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Doug, I think we\u2019re not going to go breakout those details at that level granularity, but I\u2019d point you back to some of our general commentary. Our industrial business was quite well balanced actually across many of those different categories in food and materials characterization and environmental and it was really well balanced across our major geographies, U.S., Europe and China were all in positive territory on industrial and India was slightly negative in part due to the GST tax implementation, but these are smaller, much smaller number and industrial as you know with a bigger pharma business. ", "So, I would just look at both quarter results, but also on industrial the year-to-date results and last 12-month results all in positive territory in the U.S., China and in Europe. ", "Doug Schenkel ", "Okay. Just flipping back to biopharma. You had a good year, but your biopharma revenue growth for the year has lagged the broader tools group at least the last couple of quarters. This may simply be a function of your concentration on certain product classes and company specific comparisons, that said Chris, how comfortable are you that competitive share shifts are not also a factor?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yeah, I guess as you sort of alluded to Doug, the basic comparison last two quarters of low teens growth in prior year has to be taken into consideration when looking at our pharma growth rate, but we have been really rock solid at 6% pharma growth both year-to-date as well as last 12 months and over almost any rolling period. I am confident that we are doing well from a share standpoint in the pharma business and if you compare our results over almost any rolling period to competition, I think you\u2019ll see that. ", "We obviously do the best we can to look at market share data from different sources like SDI and the oldest survey and all of those surveys tend to reinforce the same point. As you know share can be very sticky in these markets. We have done a good job innovating and holding on these shares, certainly there are some categories where we have seen some pressure like high resolution Mass spectrometry in recent years, but we also are continuing to invest in new technology that will turn that in the other direction. ", "In the heart of the LCMS world, we have done very well from a share standpoint, we believe especially with the broadening of our [indiscernible] product line that I talked about earlier and [indiscernible]. And as those two technologies continue to grow together and utilization we think we\u2019re well positioned for share gains in the future. ", "And then our core LC business, we have got a very strong base of share that\u2019s really headlined by not just for multiple technology categories of HPLC and UPLC but also our empower chromatography data systems, keep in mind we own about two-thirds of the market for CDS, which gives us great visibility into what\u2019s happening with instruments in the market and is the major competitive advantage that only continues to be enhanced. So, we do try to study the share question as much as we can but we feel good about where we are.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan", "Thanks, and good morning guys. Chris, I was wondering, could you elaborate on the industrial trends in the quarter, obviously a great result from TA and as you think about the fourth quarter, a little bit of a tougher comp there. If you could talk about the setup that would be great?", "Christopher O\u2019Connell", "So, as you point out the industrial has been a good story all year long as just to reiterate our industrial growth year-to-date has been 7% and actually last 12 months has been 9% because as you allude to we did have a strong fourth quarter in industrial last year. I would say that the balance in our industrial performance is really good between TA and those Waters categories. And TA has really come on strong this year, TA has had a year as you\u2019ve seen that\u2019s developed well over the course of the year and this quarter we saw double digit instrument growth out of TA and naturally a reflection of this we believe is really a winning product strategy around the discovery line of thermal analyzers which as you know has been rolling out steadily since mid-2016 and we\u2019re still in the process of maturing that overall portfolio of tiered instruments for all the different thermal applications. ", "I think we\u2019re also encouraged by the performance of some of the more recent acquisitions of TA, as you should know TA has a bit of a drum beat of small tuck-in product line acquisitions like the electro force group and [indiscernible] things we\u2019ve talked about in the past and a lot of those are also beginning to scale a little bit and give us strength and even a broader footprint in some of these industrial markets. ", "So obviously we watch this closely, when we came into the year we were setting out to have good balance growth between pharma and industrial and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s played out over the course of year and I think one of the more satisfying aspects of the year-to-date so far. ", "Jack Meehan", "Great. And then just one for Sherry, you mentioned on gross margin FX is about 30 bp headwind that would imply about flat year-over-year or otherwise. Could you just talk about some of the mix impact in the quarter, whether its product or end market driven that got to that result?", "Sherry Buck", "Sure, any question we have a lot of pushes and pulls on the gross margin. So there as some positive mix dynamics and manufacturing variances were helped some of the cushions on it, we had a pretty strong service quarter and so as you know that\u2019s kind of a headwind to our gross margin but it helps us on the operating margin. Our US performance, with it being, it has been improved but now there is bigger part of the total that is also a little bit of a headwind on the gross margin. So, you put all those things together and with the FX that gets us to our gross margins for the quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Steve [indiscernible] from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Hi, thanks. First is just a couple of housekeeping items for Sherry and then I have one for Chris. Sherry, there are some new revenue recognition rules coming into play for next year to get a chance to take a look at those and then see if you have any sense whether they\u2019ll impact particularly on service any of the rev record counting? ", "And then also for Sherry, it seems like currency for next year is probably going to be I don\u2019t know, maybe 3%, 4% positive to the bottom line, is that anywhere close to what you\u2019re thinking? And then again, I had one for Chris. ", "Sherry Buck ", "Sure, on the revenue recognition, our team has been doing quite a bit of work on that globally just to understand the impacts of it and while we aren\u2019t totally complete with everything our current assessment would be that we\u2019re not having material impact on our revenue line or the service contracts at this point in time. ", "Your other housekeeping question about FX for next year. So, a little too early to be giving guidance for 2018, we will do that in January, but I would say looking at today\u2019s FX rates it would be just a slight positive tailwind, I wouldn\u2019t be thinking as high as 3 or 4% based on today\u2019s rates. But, too early to call obviously since we are not in 2018 yet. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks Sherry, and then Chris look we have covered a lot of details here in the Q&A, I\u2019d love to just kind of open it up to you and ask a real simple question, it's like over the next I don\u2019t know quarter a year, you can pick the time horizon, if you want investors thinking about one thing that you really excited about that\u2019s a driver of topline growth through Waters that you think people might under appreciate. What is that? And I\u2019ll let others step in here. Thanks. ", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure, thanks for the question Steve and it\u2019s a good time to think about those things, we have just completed our second annual strategic planning process, we had a great discussion with our Board of Directors last week in New York. And one of the things that I have gained a deeper appreciation for I guess I have been on the job a little more than two years now, is just the opportunity out there, I think there is more opportunity in this business that I have been appreciated, when I first came in and that really is a function of sort of the inexorable desire of the world to gain even deeper insights into the molecular structure of material of all type whether its drugs, food or materials and I think as we look at our long range plans and we look at our technology roadmap, making our technology more accessible to more users and to really open up that opportunity not just in Pharma but in our other categories is a big opportunity. I\u2019d say at the very top of our list is something that I have mentioned in some previous settings, including your conference, which is just the rise in analytical rigor around bio-molecules and the opportunity to move LC plus Mass spec workflows into routine regulated applications and we have talked a little bit about our [indiscernible] program and there is lot behind that is well. ", "But I think there is some things out there that could lay the foundation for sustainable growth for a long period of time. And as we put more specificity around workflows and applications and informatics for the other vertical markets, we think that this is a great market development opportunity overall and I think what I am most excited about as we really hold all the cards in this deck, we have a very strong position as you know in chemical separations in Mass spectrometry particularly the integrated use of Mass spectrometry of course precision chemistries and the informatics that makes it all work together and comply with regulation and compliance needs. ", "And so, I know that\u2019s a bit of a long answer but that\u2019s the opportunity that\u2019s on my mind, and so it's up to us as the management team to be a very disciplined on how we continue to deliver strong results and growth but also balance that margin expansion with the investment in the business, to get after these opportunities. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question coming is from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Dan Arias", "Good morning, thank you. Chris, within Mass spec, can you just put some color to your comments there. You came back to the expansion of the application base in MS. So, at this point you\u2019re seeing higher growth from routine testing or is it more of the discovery research segment? Just curious how the split looks by usage or is there in fact a difference?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yeah, it\u2019s a good question Dan and actually as I highlighted in the note, we\u2019ve been encouraged by our mass spec performance this year. We\u2019ve had a solid mass spec year both in the quarter and year-to-date and that strength is broad based. We are seeing I think the beginnings of what I alluded to there in the prior question about the movement of mass spec into the heart of product development and even working its way even further downstream in to QA QC. ", "But discovery has been robust, but it's also been robust in the applied markets. Our tandem quad portfolio in particular with [indiscernible] TQSX and TQS Micro is shown its strength in the food and in some of the chemical application areas as well. So again, somewhat of an outside in view coming into the company, I really do see mass spec overtime playing out as a much more broadly utilized tool in more simple formats that go well beyond some of the research applications that its traditionally been known for. ", "Dan Arias", "Okay, helpful. And then if I just maybe could ask one more question on the setup within the customer class. If I just look at the coming quarter, the comp for biopharma is 6% I believe which is less than what it was this quarter. So, I mean if you just look ahead at 4Q, do you think you could finish the year a couple of points higher in biopharma or is 5 to 6% in line with what you\u2019ve done year-to-date still the way to think about it?", "Christopher O'Connell", "You know Dan I guess I just comment that what we always typically say which is we look at the long-term historical growth rate of the markets which we have very much been tracking at on sort of a rolling basis as we\u2019ve said. And we continue to strive for that and strive to overachieve it where we can. ", "And obviously year-end dynamics will play into that and I think we continue to look at the business as a global business. We\u2019re cautious in the US at this point but cautiously optimistic we think and we\u2019re not assuming everything goes right in terms of our guidance and so we\u2019ll continue to take step by step but the main point is that we think the pharma market is healthy overall is a very attractive and increasingly attractive market looking forward. And so, we\u2019ll just continue to stay laser focused on it in getting the best we can.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open. ", "Amanda Murphy", "Alright, good morning. I actually had a similar question to Dan just in terms of the LCE side of the business. So obviously you\u2019ve talked about or just talked about growth in generics and how that\u2019s going to continue drive our results strength in biologics. So, I just is wondering if you could help us understand kind of how the mix looks like in the install base at this point so between the alliance platform and then some of the UPLC product kind of what does that look like and how has it changed, how do you expect it to change and kind of what\u2019s the contribution to growth from both sides at this point?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure on the LCE business Amanda, that\u2019s a good question and we continue to see pretty good balance actually between our HPLC and UPLC platforms and you know at this point in time alliance in HPLC is still bigger in terms of units, the new PLC and also don\u2019t forget the [indiscernible] system which is a hybrid system that can bridge those methods and so we have a pretty robust portfolio and we continue to develop enhancements to that platform alongside our informatics platform because it's really LC plus Optical detection plus empower chromatography data systems as an overall system solution that is really the offering in the marketplace that serves particularly that generic customer as well as a wide variety of other types of molecules and it's not just the LC component but its actually the system and that\u2019s why you hear us talking so much about more of a systems orientation and systems engineering and transformational engineering things we can do uniquely by pulling all those things together. ", "Amanda Murphy ", "Got it, okay and then I also another question on China. So, one of the other areas you talked about in the past as being a driver of growth is traditional medicine. I just was curious if you had any contacts around how big that market could be for you, is that, as you think about China is obviously growing quite well, but how much of that market is driving the growth at this point and again kind of thinking going forward?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yes, that\u2019s a good question. TCM is definitely a unique aspect of the China market, and it's hard to predict I think or get our arms around how big that could be but it\u2019s an important market and the data point that I always love to hear and see is that the Chinese population takes prescriptions in equal amounts for TCM type products as well as traditional medical therapies and yet the labeling requirements in the testing methods around TCMs are small but growing quickly and so there does seem to be a genuine interest on a part of the Chinese regulators to continue to enhance the labeling requirements and the testing requirements for TCMs and we think that\u2019s a long term tailwind, those are pretty niche applications now. But we definitely see TCM and I'd also throw in food and food testing alongside TCM as categories that are seeing increasing regulation within China. ", "China, has been a great story for the Company, we have had a very strong year-to-date in last 12 months and quarter itself in China and the thing that continues to impress me about China is the balance and the breadth of that growth, China is actually less concentrated in pharma than a lot of other markets, its more concentrated in food and materials than other markets and even within pharma has a lot of diversity in terms of generics, innovator drugs and TCMs. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ", "Patrick Donnelly", "Great thanks. Chris, I think you guys aren\u2019t the best proxy for government academic market given your relatively small exposure but certainly saw some notable growth there. Can you maybe just kind of talk through where you saw particular areas of strength and then maybe just a focus on the U.S. what you saw with the lab budgets here? ", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure, no actually Patrick you are exactly right, you said it well which is we\u2019re not a great proxy for that market, its roughly 10% of our revenue. It was definitely a good quarter overall and that built on the 5% we grew in the prior quarter and year-to-date though if you look at more the rolling period of year-to-date or last 12 months were in that low to mid-single digit type range which is again I think more characteristic of that market overall. ", "As we pointed out before, the academic market is small for us and somewhat lumpy. So, we do get quarter-to-quarter variation and will continue to emphasize that because if the market goes down a bit or up a bit, we don\u2019t get overly exercised because we see a pretty steady drumbeat of that business over the rolling period. But in particular there just continues I think to be a very healthy appetite for investment in biomedical research and in the Omex and we\u2019re particularly pleased with our position in a lot of the metabolomics type work, assays and have particularly strength there and we have seen greater and greater interest from the research community on metabolomics and better understanding of microbiome and some of the related areas of biomedical research.", "Patrick Donnelly", "Okay, makes sense. And maybe just one more on pharma and obviously a few questions on that, but when you look at the last couple of quarters at 4 or 5% growth, when you look forward, do you see kind of pockets of growth opportunity that you feel can reaccelerate this market towards kind of the high single digit growth that you feel and I know you talked about the longer-term growth rate of 6%. I mean do you feel like we\u2019re kind of in the cycle where we\u2019re going to hang around there for a little while there?", "Christopher O'Connell", "I don\u2019t exactly know, I mean I think we feel good about the overall market right now as we\u2019ve said and you now we never get too far ahead of our tips if you will in terms of forecasting accelerated growth over historical trends but as you know we do get that from time-to-time from quarter-to-quarter and we\u2019ve had some years like that and we do think that the underlying trends in pharma give us that possibility of continuing to see better growth from time-to-time and to fairly safely rely on that through the long-term historical rates. So, it's pretty hard to predict when that happens but it has happened and ought to continue to happen from time-to-time that we get some acceleration. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. ", "Puneet Souda", "Hi Chris, thanks for taking my questions. A quick clarification on the GST, I just assume India has still 7 to 8% of the mix. So, if you look at the GST categories and changes from a tax perspective and the GST tax buckets, once they are accounted for is it a benefit to the customer or is it a negative for them and then if that market is still continuing to be largely alliance or some of them shifting to UPLC on the generic end?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Yeah, thanks for the question and just to clarify couple of quick things. India is more in the 6 to 7% range of our mix versus 7% to 8% but that\u2019s a pretty small difference and yes, GST is actually a really important thing and its just [indiscernible] of India and a bull on India and the economy and the government of India really. I applaud the implementation of GST as well as measures like demonetization. I think what India is doing right now is putting in some changes to their economy that could pave the way for more stability going forward. ", "The delay in orders and shipments is purely related to systems implementations for our customers to be compliant with the new laws and that our systems have to match up to their systems. So, as we work through that which we\u2019re working through real time, and our customers are working through that will provide certainly a very stable base of transactional capability going forward and I don\u2019t see it as any kind of an ongoing headwind, or in particular on a Q tailwind other than the catch that we will see. But really, I think it's another example of more of a long term foundational attribute of the Indian economy that will benefit the country overtime. ", "Puneet Souda", "Okay, thanks for that. And quickly on the Hurricane impact as well as just wanted to understand, are you expecting, are you accounting for any of the uptick and instrument replacement at some of these mass specs and LC that are largely sitting idle, I mean I ask that because some of us would been in mass specs, and essential detectors rule go bad overtime as they are sitting on the back end, so just trying to understand if there is any replacement tailwind coming from that in your guidance and expectations?", "Christopher O'Connell", "I think we\u2019re actually pretty conservative on that and we\u2019re not assuming any kind of accelerated replacement or tailwind there. I mean we\u2019re really focused on the needs of our employees and our customers, obviously we have employees in some of these ravaged areas Puerto Rico and beyond and our focus is really purely on getting people back up and running and helping our customers work through this and if that results in some additional opportunity down the road great, but we\u2019re not thinking opportunistically about it in that way, we\u2019re thinking more operationally about it and doing the best we can to serve our customers. ", "So, I think we have time, for one or two quick ones here, John maybe two more please operator. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Brandon Couillard ", "Thanks. One quicker for Sherry, sort of housekeeping items. What was the revenue contribution from M&A in the third quarter, and just to confirm, you do have an extra day in the fourth quarter, correct?", "Sherry Buck ", "Yes, so just a very small contribution from M&A coming through TA as Chris mentioned in his earlier comments. And then there isn\u2019t extra day in the fourth quarter and we kind of fully factor that into our outlook and guidance. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.", "Steve Willoughby", "Thanks Steven here. Just a quick one for Sherry and then a question for Chris. Sherry, just when I am looking, just want to make sure I have a little math right here on your third quarter results. I believe your guidance was for a 4% to 5% headwind from FX and then FX was a penny positive, do I have that right, so it's kind of a similar in a $0.07 to $0.09 positive swing for FX in the quarter. ", "Sherry Buck ", "Yes, that\u2019s correct. ", "Steve Willoughby", "Okay. And then Chris just wonder if you could comment all about kind of your product vitality in terms of what products are driving your growth these days whether its new products, kind of older products, how the QDA fits into that and any comments on kind of the overall new product pipeline?", "Christopher O'Connell", "Sure, I won't give too precise of an answer on that, because it does move around quarter to quarter but actually -- we are balance really comes to our mind, I am impressed by the contribution of very old products if you will like Alliance, HPLC Systems with empower chromatography data. That continues to chug along and be a very reliable source of growth. We continue to see good uptick on what I will call sort of medium in the market products like UPLC and QD arc as well. Like I said mass specs have been really solid and that\u2019s been a combination of some technology that\u2019s been in the market for a few years like TQS Micro, QDA, but also the [indiscernible] which is about a year old. ", "So, have a lot of balance, and we do have a pretty strong product cycle we believe coming up in \u201918 and beyond and we\u2019ll continue to try to leverage all aspects of this. One thing I do think about a lot of not just the launch of new technology but really how that technology grabs hold and gets traction in the marketplace and sometimes the biggest impact you actually see in a lot of these products and technology categories is actually in your two, three and four as some of those technologies work their way in to more standards of measurement. ", "So anyway, we think we have a pretty vibrant product offering and a good product position in this as I\u2019ve said today and many times R&D investment is our number one priority for growth for the future. ", "So anyway, with that maybe we\u2019ll finish with the questions and just want to say thank you for the great questions from all of you. In conclusion, we\u2019re pleased with our results through the first three quarters of 2017, headlined by our ability to deliver consistently strong organic revenue growth combined with disciplined P&L management to deliver double digit earnings per share growth. As we close out 2017, we remain focused on execution and feel that market conditions combined with our strong competitive position support continued success. ", "So, on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for our support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2017 call which we currently anticipate holding on January 23rd 2018. Thanks, and have a great day. ", "Operator", "Thank you.

Joining me on this morning\u2019s call is Sherry Buck, Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer and John Lynch, Corporate Treasurer.", "Before we get started, I would like to thank John for his leadership of the Waters\u2019 Investor Relations function over the last several years. Moving forward, John will be focusing on Corporate Finance and Treasury activities. During today\u2019s call, I will provide an overview of our Q4 and full year 2017 operating results as well as some broader commentary on our current business environment. Sherry will then review financial details for our reported results and provide our 2018 financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.", "I am very pleased with our fourth quarter and 2017 in total. We finished 2017 with a strong quarter of sales growth in our key end markets highlighted by broad-based strength from pharmaceutical customers, a rebounding U.S. market and balanced product mix. For the full year 2017, the highlight to me was the great revenue balance across end markets, geographies and product lines resulting in consistent sales performance and double-digit earnings per share growth in each quarter of the year. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was up 6% against a very strong comparison of 9% growth in the same period in 2016. Earnings per share grew 14% in the fourth quarter. This strong finish in Q4 led to full year revenue growth of 6%, a strong P&L featuring modest operating leverage while investing in promising growth initiatives and 13% earnings per share growth for the full year. Additionally, we delivered very strong free cash flow growth of 10% in 2017.", "Taking a closer look and starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category grew 8% in the quarter, highlighted by strong demand from U.S. pharmaceutical customers, continued double digit pharma growth in China and a solid pharma rebound in India. For the full year global sales growth from pharma was 7% against a strong base of comparison of 10% in 2016. Throughout the year we continued to see consistent sustainable results driven by our increasingly diverse base of customers, attractive geographical balance and strong product positions in our small molecule, large molecule and medical research applications. Our ongoing strategy work continues to emphasize the vast opportunities in our pharmaceutical business where we believe we are very well positioned to expand our core technologies into a greater breadth of applications to meet the growing and increasingly complex requirements of our customers.", "Sales to our worldwide industrial category which includes the materials characterization food and environmental and fine chemical markets were flat in the quarter against a very tough 14% comparison in the prior year\u2019s quarter. For the full year we delivered a solid 5% growth in our industrial category and saw growth across all of our key geographies and major product lines. We continue to be excited about our industrial product positions and pipeline and the breadth of opportunity across materials characterization, food safety and environmental applications. Looking at our governmental and academic category, sales grew by 13% in Q4 with broad based performance across all major geographies. In particular, we saw strong spending in the quarter from academic institutions focused on biomedical and Omex research. For the full year 2017 our governmental and academic category grew a very solid 6% though as we have consistently stated this business is a smaller part of our mix and sales tend to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter.", "Next I will review our performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia now our largest region in terms of revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter, led by China which grew 14% against a very strong comparison in the prior year period. Our China operations saw a solid growth from all key end markets. Also in the region India rebounded nicely in Q4 as we successfully work through disruption caused in the third quarter due to the implementation of the new GST system. For the full year Asia grew 10% highlighted by 17% growth in China, high single-digit growth in India and steady growth in Japan. Turning to the Americas, sales grew 6% for the quarter with U.S. sales up and encouraging 9%, sales in the U.S. was broad based across key end markets and product lines. We were encouraged by the pickup in spending from midsize and large U.S. pharmaceutical customers who had been more cautious earlier in the year. For the full year sales in the Americas were flat with the U.S. growing 1% as second half growth more than offset the first half declines.", "Europe continued to be a strong contributor with fourth quarter sales growing 7%, highlighted by broad based growth across the region from our pharmaceutical and medical research customers. We saw European strength in small molecule applications and continued performance in biopharma applications where we are well positioned with our targeted LCMS and biopharmaceutical separation solutions. We also saw strong service revenue from our large and growing base of installed systems. For the year Europe grew 8% delivering strong and steady results throughout the year.", "Finally I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded products \u2013 Waters branded instrument sales grew 3% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year, led by a particular strength in core LC and LCMS systems sold to our pharmaceutical customers. Within instruments, I would like to highlight our bench-top LC tandem mass spectrometry systems led by our higher end Xevo TQ-XS as well as the workhorse Xevo TQS Micro. LCMS systems continued to grow solidly in the quarter and consistently for the full year. As we have commented on in the past we continue to see the expansion of mass spec technology into routine quantification workflows primarily in food safety and biopharmaceutical applications. The development of our tandem quadrupole Xevo platform has enabled us to meet the evolving demands for reproducible quantification capabilities for both small and large molecules. Waters\u2019 branded recurring revenues, the combination of service and precision chemistries, which represent approximately 50% of the corporation\u2019s business, grew 9% in the quarter. Recurring revenues were driven by global strength for our service, HPLC and UPLC application kits and complete chemistry offerings. For the full year, our service and chemistry revenues grew 7% indicative of high utilization rates for the installed base of Waters instruments.", "Turning to our TA product line, sales grew by 10% in the quarter bringing full year growth to a strong 8%. Instrument system sales for TA grew 12% in the quarter and 11% for the year with broad-based growth across thermal analysis and rheology product lines. Looking ahead, we continue to see opportunities to capitalize on the rising innovation in highly engineered high-performance materials. We will continue to emphasize our discovery series of thermal analyzers while continuing system launches that will add to an already fresh and strong product line.", "Stepping back, I am pleased with the consistent top line and bottom line results that Waters delivered all four quarters over the past year and I am excited about all we have ahead of us in 2018. As we drive for consistent execution again in 2018, we also remain steadfastly focused on our 5-point long-term value creation model. As I have consistently communicated, we aim to create shareholder value by number one, holding a highly differentiated leadership positions in structurally attractive markets; number two, executing a clear and focused growth strategy driven by organic innovation; number three, programmatically driving continuous operational improvement; number four, being a disciplined capital allocator; and number five, operating with the performance-oriented culture and management team.", "As we look to 2018, we are anticipating solid market conditions across our key customer defined end markets. In pharma, we continue to see macro trends at rising global regulatory standards increasing global patient access to prescription drugs and the growing testing needs of new biologic drugs that feature in ever increasing complexity of molecular structure. In materials, food and environmental, demand remains strong driven by healthy global industrial conditions and the general rise of regulatory standards for performance and quality. All of these market trends point to customer needs that can be well served by Waters\u2019 core technologies and a greater breadth of applications optimized with our particular strengths in chemistry, software and professional service.", "Lastly, I would like to make some comments on tax reform generally and the impact on Waters specifically. Overall, I am very positive about what tax reform means for U.S. economic conditions and the overall competitiveness of the U.S. economy. In particular, I am intrigued about the positive implications for increasing U.S. capital deployment by companies of all kinds. Sherry will provide details on the short-term effects of the new law on our tax rate. But before she does, I would like to share my thoughts on capital allocation and the new opportunities created for Waters under the new tax loss.", "As you know, Waters has always been a judicious allocator of capital. We look at our capital allocation strategy in three levels: number one, invest in the business; number two, enhance our balance sheet strength and flexibility; and number three, return capital to shareholders. Now, with tax efficient access to our significant global free cash flow, we see great opportunity in all three of these areas. In terms of investing in the business, there is now opportunity to invest in the United States at a lower cost of capital where our cash can be very efficiently deployed alongside our innovation processes and supply chain operations.", "While we already have a strong balance sheet full access to our global cash flow gives us the opportunity to optimize our capital structure for maximum flexibility and opportunistic investments. In terms of returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, tax reform provides us with confidence in the sustainability of our program and additional flexibility to enhance return of capital to shareholders. Looking forward, we will proceed carefully and thoughtfully in evaluating our opportunities for enhanced capital deployment. As we do this, I will continue to view our significant cash balances as a strategic asset of the company that can wait patiently as we seek the right opportunities to invest in high return on investment initiatives.", "With that, I would like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper look of the fourth quarter and our full year financials. Sherry?", "Sherry Buck", "Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. We recorded net sales in the fourth quarter of $687 million, an increase of about 6% before currency translation which increased sales growth in the quarter by about 3% and resulted in 9% reported sales growth. For the full year sales grew by 6% before currency translation which increased sales growth by 1%.", "In the quarter pharmaceutical markets grew 8% and industrial markets were flat and sales to academic and governmental customers were up 13%. For the full year pharmaceutical markets grew 7%, our industrial markets grew 8% \u2013 5% excuse me and sales to academic and governmental customers were up 6%. Product line growth was strongest in our recurring revenue with the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue growing 8% while instrument sales grew 4% in the quarter. For the full year recurring revenue grew 7%, while sales of our instrument product groups grew 5%.", "Breaking the quarter down further sales relating to Waters branded products and services were up 5%, while TA sales grew 10%. Combined LC and LCMS instrument platform sales increased by 3% and TA\u2019s instrumentation system sales grew 12%. As we continue to see the benefits of new product introductions. Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 8%. Looking at our growth rates in the fourth quarter geographically and before currency translation, sales in Americas were up 6% with sales in the U.S. increasing 9%. European sales were up 7% and sales in Asia were up 6% led by strong growth in China and India.", "Now I would like to comment on our fourth quarter\u2019s non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter were 60.6% versus 60% in the fourth quarter of 2016 showing a strong finish to the year. For the full year gross margins were slightly better than the prior year at 59%. Moving down the fourth quarter\u2019s P&L, operating expenses were up 9% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency translation increased operating expense growth by about 2% on a reported basis, stronger than anticipated revenue growth resulted in higher variable expenses in the quarter. For the full year operating expenses were impacted by R&D expense growing faster than sales as we continue to invest in product development and innovation which is a key component of our value creation model that Chris spoke to earlier.", "On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate in the quarter before the effects of the new U.S. tax cuts and jobs act which are referred to as tax reform and the new stock compensation rule was about 15%. Including a $0.07 benefit from new stock option accounting rules the non-GAAP effective operating tax rate was about 13%. In the quarter as a result of tax reform we incurred a GAAP tax expense charge of $550 million, nearly 90% of this amount is associated with the transition tax on earnings and profits outside the U.S. This charge represents our best estimate and the actual expense may differ from this estimate due to further refinement of our calculations or additional guidance that may become available. For the full year our effective operating tax rate before the effects of tax reform and the new stock compensation rule was 14.7% versus 14.1% in 2016. The increase in the effective operating tax rate was driven by the mix of our earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, including a $0.24 benefit from the new stock option accounting rules the non-GAAP effective operating tax rate was 11.8%.", "In the quarter, net interest expense was $4 million and our average share count on a fully diluted basis equivalent came in at 80.4 million shares or approximately 1 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter last year. This is the net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter we bought 431,000 shares of our common stock for $85 million our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were up 14% to $2.51 in comparison to earnings of $2.21 last year. On a GAAP basis we reported a loss of $4.44 versus earnings at $2.15 last year. As noted previously, our GAAP earnings in Q4 2017 include the impact of tax reform. Both of our non-GAAP and GAAP earnings include a benefit of $0.07 resulting from the new stock compensation accounting rules. The impact of foreign currency translation in the quarter on earnings per share was a positive $0.08 bringing the full year impact to about $0.09. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 13% to $7.49 per share versus $6.62 last year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $0.25 versus $6.41 in 2016. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.", "Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $3.4 billion and debt totaled $2 billion bringing us to a net cash position of $1.4 billion. We defined free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the fourth quarter of 2017, cash flow was strong and came in at $162 million after funding $30 million of capital expenditures. This represents both a strong quarterly performance and a full year growth of approximately 10%. We were able to convert $0.27 of free cash from every dollar\u2019s worth of sales for the full year. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, which is even with the third quarter and flat from the fourth quarter of last year. In the quarter, inventories were approximately $270 million compared to $263 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year, which was in line with our expectations.", "Looking ahead to 2018, our outlook generally assumes continued stable demand from our pharmaceutical and industrial end markets, consistent growth and recurring revenue and balanced growth rates from our geographies. These dynamics lead up to a mid single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2018. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to increase 2018 sales growth by about 1%. Gross margins for the year are expected to be consistent with the prior year in the range between 58.5% to 59%. Our plan for the full year is to manage operating expense growth at a rate that is less than our sales growth.", "Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $16 million to $17 million, a reduction as compared to 2017 due to the increased flexibility and deploying our cash balances as a result of tax reform. We estimate our full year tax rate, which reflects the impact of tax reform and stock compensation rules to be in the range of 13% to 15%. This includes an estimated impact of about 2% related to provisions in the new tax reform law. Breaking this down further, we were estimating a positive impact in the range of 1% to 2% due to lower U.S. tax rates. However, this is offset by an unfavorable impact in the range of 2% to 3% as a result of the intangible and base broadening provisions and a lower tax benefit from stock compensation as a result of the U.S. tax rate reduction to 21% from 35%. We expect to further refine our full year tax rate as we gain more clarity on the tax reform regulations and will provide updates as appropriate.", "Our guidance regarding capital allocation assumes continuation of our share repurchase program through 2018 at a rate that will result in an average diluted share count of about 78.5 million shares outstanding. This share count assumes a share repurchase plan for the year that will approximately offset the impact to our tax rate from tax reform. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis full year 2018 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within the range of $8 to $8.25. At current rates, the foreign currency impact on full year earnings per share growth is expected to be about neutral.", "Now, looking at the first quarter of 2018, we expect constant currency sales growth in the mid single-digits. At today\u2019s rates, currency translation is expected to positively impact first quarter sales growth by about 2%. Other key assumptions for Q1 include a moderate increase in expenses as well as an estimated increase in our overall tax rate in Q1 of about 5% to 6%. The Q1 tax rate is impacted by tax reform and a strong $0.09 base of comparison from the stock option compensation benefit in the first quarter of 2017. Lastly there was one less calendar day in the quarter versus last year. We estimate first quarter earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.48 to $1.60 with an approximate 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation at current rates.", "Now I would like to turn the call back to Chris. Chris?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Great. Thank you, Sherry. As we move into 2018 we will continue to emphasize execution in our core businesses and delivering on our operating performance objectives. As we have stated we will seek to balance growth, operating leverage and investment in the business. With that we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get everyone\u2019s questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and if you have additional questions please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, can we have the first question please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hi. Chris, I want to start with the rebound in the U.S. market, good pharma strength, good academic, can you maybe just talk on those two trends how you are feeling, kind of exiting the year, was there any budget flush dynamic and in other segments?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes. Thanks Tycho. Yes, we were as I said in the prepared remarks we were encouraged by the U.S. As you know the first half of the year we sustained some declines as it was pretty clear at the time and an even more clear in retrospect that there was caution on the part of a lot of U.S. companies particularly in pharma and some of the industrial businesses really waiting some of the regulation and policy and tax changes that came later in the year. We did see as you recall some improvement in the third quarter in the U.S. and then we had a nice close to the year. So I would just say that the finish that we had hoped for in the U.S. was. There was a renewed sense of confidence in a pretty broad based way across the end markets. And we feel good about that going into the year. Now, obviously one quarter does not a trend make and so as we enter 2018 we are hopeful, but we are also balanced in terms of what might happen from here.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then you kind of maybe commented around cash being a strategic asset here, I understand there are lot of kind of moving pieces, but I guess as we think about the potential to bring back cash when do we expect we will get more granularity and visibility on that and then you kind of alluded to more investment here in U.S., I guess over what timeframe should we be thinking about that?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Sure. Based on the way the tax works and I will have Sherry comment further on some of the mechanics if you wish. Once we pay this toll tax, we have access to that cash. And obviously we are thoughtful in where that cash is to maximize the return on that cash while we go through our decision making on how to deploy it. And really my comment on cash is a strategic asset is a very thoughtful approach to making the right decisions in terms of allocation of capital to all of our priorities to invest in the business to show up our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. We obviously have a great share repurchase program, as Sherry commented we are going to continue or even enhance that in the current year to offset some of the effects of the minor short-term tax rate increase. But we really have an eye towards being opportunistic I would say. In terms of investing in the U.S. as I mentioned it\u2019s a much more favorable investment environment and there are clearly some investments that historically maybe we have been a little more cautious on the U.S. given the uncertainty of the tax situation but now are taking a more careful look at and we will obviously provide more details on some of the things that we are considering as we develop those plans. But we are going to be patient and we are going to thoughtful, we are going to be careful about that because we are very fortunate to be in a position of having significant cash to allocate against a high return on investment opportunities.", "Tycho Peterson", "Does this change your view on M&A at all in terms of opportunities?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "No, it doesn\u2019t change our view at all in M&A. As you know we are more organically driven. That said, we are also making sure we are aware of everything happening in the marketplace if we were to consider M&A would be from a strategic lens we would not change our approach relative to our investment priorities, but is a tactic to support a business strategy, we are open to it, but we would be very disciplined about it. And as I try to consistently say access to cash doesn\u2019t necessarily change our willingness to engage in M&A.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Dan Leonard", "Thank you. First question on tax reform, Chris, are you in discussions with your customers, are you getting any early indication that tax reform is going to stimulate demand for Waters products in 2018?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes, Dan, it\u2019s a good question. And I would say it\u2019s too early for me to put too fine a point on that. I think what we saw with our customers and in discussions is just a general relief that tax reform is here and excitement about a more favorable investment environment in the United States. And in terms of tying specific purchases of our technology to that type an event, it\u2019s probably too early to make that directive a connection, but certainly there is a tone that\u2019s out there that\u2019s generally positive and we are grateful for that, but keep in mind, U.S. is really only about 30% of our overall business and half of that business is recurring revenue anyway. So, I think the effect you would see would be balanced.", "Dan Leonard", "Okay. And then from my follow-up question, how are you contemplating the potential for pharma M&A as you think about your guidance for 2018 from M&A and any potential disruptions associated with that?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes, I guess I am not really an expert in handicapping whether pharma M&A is going to accelerate or not. There is probably better sources for that but I think my view on pharma M&A is that as long as pharma M&A is being done for the reasons of enhancing product portfolios and therapeutic portfolios, which is generally what I think happens. I think it\u2019s something that wouldn\u2019t necessarily affect us all that much. At the end of the day most of our business is tied to late stage development and QA/QC and we know that pharma companies who are under taking those type of strategies are looking to enhance their portfolios in the market and really leverage combinations to address overhead cost not necessarily innovation and certainly not production costs as it relates to serving the market. So either way, I think the demand for our products should be approximate and we will watch it carefully, but I don\u2019t really have a clear sense as to how that may play out.", "Dan Leonard", "Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hi, good morning. I am really just going to ask one question, but maybe I will pick on a few parts within it. It\u2019s just a request to get a little bit deeper understanding of some of the components of the thinking around the top line outlook for 2018. I guess, first, Chris as I reflected back on your comments, you gave some pretty encouraging comments on pharma and how you think about pharma as a source of funds in 2018. I wonder if you could give us a sense for where you think pharma lands as a growth driver and the model relative to the long-term trend in the maybe 6%, 7% range. Could we do a little bit better maybe in 2018 as we get relief in the U.S.? Second, I didn\u2019t hear you talk about what you think about the trend in terms of academic funding, very strong quarter for the company there, some enthusiasm around academic funding in a number of parts of the U.S.? And then third started piloting with the multi-parter here, but could you talk a little bit about the balance between hardware growth in 2018 and recurring growth in 2018, particularly around LCMS and then I will get back in queue and say thanks so much.", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Good. Thank you, Steve. I will try to remember all of that. As it relates to pharma and our outlook for pharma, like I said, we were encouraged with the close to the year we had a good solid year of 7% pharma growth in total and that was on tough comp and that is ahead \u2013 a little bit ahead of the historic trend line, so just to remind on the historic trend line, the long-term trend line of pharma growth for us tends to be around 6%, which is a little ahead of the market. We have been doing a little bit better than that recently. In terms of our assumptions for \u201818, again, we go into a year with a balanced outlook. We don\u2019t assume in our guidance that everything goes right even though we strive for to do as well as we can. So, we are watching the market carefully particularly the U.S. as I mentioned before one quarter does not a trend make, but I would say we are hopeful for more stable conditions particularly United States as we enter the year based on the additional certainty there is relative to tax reform and some other factors. As it relates to academic funding, again we are not probably the best proxy, not the best proxy for that type of question since academic and government is a smaller percentage of our business. Academic though is the lion\u2019s share of our government and academic category. We had a good year there. We had 6% growth, but keep in mind the prior year we had a 3% decline. As you know, that business tends to be quite lumpy. And while we did see decent trends in the back half of the year for the academic world, particularly really in all geographies around the world, it\u2019s never entirely clear how sustainable that is, so, again looking at balance coming into the year in sort of the middle or part of our guidance for historical kind of range of academic type performance. And then I think the last question you asked about was instrument growth. We had a solid instrument year overall of 4% growth and that was on a comp of 6% the prior year. And in the fourth quarter, our instrument growth was about 3%, but against a very tough comp of 9% for the prior year, so really pretty consistent with historical trends you are seeing our instrument growth that is slightly slower than our overall top line average with chemistry and service doing a little bit better than the average in that mix continues to gradually migrate towards the recurring revenue. So, I don\u2019t think there is anything that unusual going on there other than to say we are pleased with the solid performance across all those categories.", "Operator", "And we will go to our next question it\u2019s from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Tim Evans", "Thanks. Chris, I just want to push a little bit on the tax reform, because this is such a massive change to potentially to your capital structure and investment paradigm. Two specific questions and maybe you can answer about your long-term targets. Number one, do you want to continue to be in a net cash position or do you at some point in the future anticipate being in a net debt position. Obviously, your balance sheet should be able to sustain our net debt position given your cash flow. Second question is in the long run do you anticipate your R&D expenditures or your CapEx to be materially higher as a percentage of revenue than they are now given the ability to invest differently in the U.S.? Thanks.", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes, thanks, Tim. Appreciate the question. In terms of long-term goals of net cash or net debt, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have a pre-described formula in our head. We want to do the right things to be great capital allocators. I think that\u2019s the bottom line. Like I said, cash is a great asset for us to have and we want to make sure we are flexible to invest opportunistically when the right opportunities present themselves across that entire range of capital allocation priorities. If that means that we are more cash heavy until that happens fine, if that means at some point we find the right opportunity to invest and get more debt heavy that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s really going to be a function of the return on invested capital, which have been consistent in terms of being the priority and at what point in time those investments are most fruitful. As it relates to changes in R&D and CapEx, I think you have seen me really emphasize R&D in terms of the returns to the company and the organic growth strategy. In fact, I was looking at some numbers last night and our R&D over the last 5 years has very steadily grown and conservatively grown from about 7.5% of products revenue that\u2019s excluding service where there isn\u2019t any R&D, but 7.5% of products revenue to 8.5% of products revenue over the last 5 years in a very gradual study way and I like that. I am pleased with that, because we have also been able to cover that with efficiency gains in other parts of the P&L to deliver modest ongoing operating leverage. As it relates to CapEx, we have been a pretty steady 3.5% to 4% of sales type CapEx company and CapEx investments and opportunities to invest in CapEx, we would look at, but if there anything major we would obviously give more information as we assess those opportunities. So I would characterize the answer overall is open minded, but very disciplined and patient to B grade capital allocators.", "Tim Evans", "Understood, okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin", "Hey, good morning. Hey, where are we in the industrial analytical instrument growth cycle, I mean the market has been rounding, but still been a little bit slower than I would have thought, I guess can you sort of talk about some of the industrial end market demands and just what your chemical customers doing, some of your material sciences customers and just do you expect that segment to accelerate significantly in 2018?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 Derik, I think the industrial marketplace is in a good space right now. Heading into last year we were a little more cautious for particularly some of the U.S. type reasons, but as the year played out and we look at the year as a total body work. Industrial was right in the \u2013 right in the zone of the mid single-digits in a solid and we believe hopefully sustainable way. And obviously that\u2019s reinforced by a broader global economic backdrop of a pretty good balance in most major geographies around the world, good growth, employment pictures are pretty solid, relatively low rates of inflation. So the overall economic backdrop and many people comment on this has been supportive of that. In our quarter there were some core key one-time type factors year-over-year as I mentioned we are in a 14% growth in industrial in the fourth quarter of \u201816. And so if you look at a stacked comp quarter-to-quarter is solid and we also had some lingering effects that hit the industrial category are related to the natural disaster aftereffects in Latin America. So there were some kind of one timers in there, but maybe the best proxy for us in terms of what\u2019s currently happening in industrial is TA Instruments, you mentioned material science, material characterization, which is the heart and soul of TA. And TA had a solid year as we mentioned. That business does tend to be historically a little more lumpy, because it\u2019s more instrument oriented, but TA is probably a more indicative of the underlying. Picture in industrial and obviously TA we are getting better than average results, because of the new product platform that we have the market, the discovery series and so we are doing even better than maybe underlying demand, because of that new technology in the market. But I would characterize industrial overall as reasonably stable. I am not one to call cycles, so we are just going to again watch it carefully as we go into the year and have a balanced outlook that I think it gives us some confidence and reasonable performance as we look at \u201818.", "Derik de Bruin", "Great. And just one follow-up on this, so in the LC business and the QA QC business, I guess how much is the \u2013 the demands are very good for a while, I mean how much demand right now is replacement business versus capacity addition in the QA QC market, I am just curious is like how many new plants are going, I mean obviously some of your end customers are consolidating manufacturing, I am just wondering how you think about that the dynamic between new adds versus consolidation versus replacement?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes. There is some, generally, about half of the business out there is sort of replacing older units that are going out of service and about half is new adds. And I think the underlying thing that I look at is just the volume of testing activity and to me that\u2019s in two different ways. One is just the additional testing activity related volume and looking at global prescriptions and global pill counts and the rising access to medications that many people are enjoying around the world, practically in the emerging markets. That\u2019s sort of a steady drumbeat of fleet expansion if you will and opportunity for new entrants. We have a pretty broad pharmaceutical customer base, so it\u2019s not just about big companies replacing their products and expanding plants, it\u2019s also about a lot of new upstarts that you see across the range from innovator molecules to generics. And then obviously the testing activity on the innovator side with more and more focus being on biomolecules and more elaborate testing methods, those are both things that add up to that total activity which really yields at the end of the day, expansion of fleet, new facility and then some kind of drumbeat of replacement is older technologies need to be replaced.", "Derik de Bruin", "Thanks.", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Dan Arias", "Hi, good morning. Thanks. Chris, maybe just to finish the thought on Derik\u2019s question, how should we think about TA growth this year given the things that you mentioned?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes. So again like I will go back to the theme that that we have a balanced outlook for TA, TA obviously had a strong year, they have tough comps obviously coming into the year with the kind of year they had. So, the counter starts at zero again and it\u2019s a big hill decline. And as long as the overall industrial conditions in the market are favorable, I think we feel we have got the product portfolio to compete in that market. But again our guidance doesn\u2019t assume that everything goes right although my expectation is to for TA to perform with the company average or better.", "Dan Arias", "Okay. Then maybe just as a follow-up, two quick geography questions on Europe, obviously things right there in a pretty good place, can you touch on Western versus Eastern Europe and then how those two shape up for the year when think about your overall outlook for the region in \u201818. And then also just curious what you are thinking on Japan if you are giving the ups and downs that we have had there?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Sure. In terms of Europe, it was noteworthy in Europe this year to have the type of consistency we had across the year. And it was I would say consistency quarter-to-quarter that was somebody unusual historically. And I think it reflects the broad base of reasonable economic conditions in the background. We actually had kind of an unusual dynamic where for the better part of the year all four regions within Europe were in positive territory Northern Europe, Western Europe, Central Europe and \u2013 sorry Northern Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe had a good year that that business had been down and in some prior years, but had a reasonable year. I think we are hoping for again a balanced outlook as we come to this year, but I certainly don\u2019t know enough to forecast individual sub-geographies with any precision. But Europe has been a solid performer for us really driven by that solid base of pharmaceutical customers throughout Europe as well as reasonable biomedical research world. Japan had a solid year. Japan was a pretty typical, kind of low to mid single-digit type grower for Waters in both the quarter and the year. And as you know Japan tends to move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter based on how the different categories are doing in fiscal years and so forth. But our Japanese business has been in the broader picture quite stable and a good cash flow generator.", "Dan Arias", "Thanks so much.", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Thank you, Dan.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to talk briefly about SG&A expense in the quarter, it grew 12% actually a little bit more in the fourth quarter, when we look at why the incremental margin wasn\u2019t a bit higher and a strong top line growth quarter, this is the line that jumps out at us, so I am just wondering was there some opportunistic investment in a period of growth and if so where were these targeted investments made and what are you looking for in terms of targeted returns either in 2018 or beyond?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Sure, sure, yes. Obviously, quarter-to-quarter dynamics in the P&L jump around a little bit, Doug, as you know. I would point you back to the big picture for the year we saw a 40 basis point expansion in our operating margin and I count that as good solid modest operating leverage what we are able to invest exactly to your point. We actually grew R&D expenses for the year at about double \u2013 about 10% constant currency even with the modest operating leverage and also grew our SG&A expenses slightly lower than sales for the year. So, for the quarter, there was some catch-up in terms of incentive compensation with the stronger than expected finish on the revenue line and some things that are probably more akin to what you might consider one-timers, but it is that balance that we are trying to strike, I will have Sherry comment a little bit further on the P&L, but I think overall we feel good about the year that delivered that balance of growth investment and operating leverage. So, Sherry, you want to add to that?", "Sherry Buck", "Yes. Just to highlight what Chris said, we go into each year really trying to manage our operating expenses to grow less than our top line and fourth quarter in particular because of the stronger performance we had some catch-up on variables and that\u2019s kind of our plan is to keep managing that. We have a number of things underway as we go into 2018 to put some more programmatic things behind, how we continue to get continuous improvement on our operating margins. So, we look for modest improvements.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay. And thank you for that. And Sherry, I think one more for you. Just looking ahead and thinking about guidance specifically gross margin. We saw some nice momentum coming out of 2017, one might have thought that this would continue in 2018 at least to a level that\u2019s maybe a little bit higher than where you have guided, which is for essentially flat year-over-year gross margins. Would you just walk us through the puts and takes there and it seems like FX is likely part of this. So, if you wouldn\u2019t mind getting a little more specific there that would be helpful?", "Sherry Buck", "Sure. So on the gross margin line, the kind of big factors around that obviously with higher volume or higher sales we would be able to give positive impact being able to offset fixed cost absorption, but really mix plays a really big part as we look at the mix of our sales both geographically as well as service revenues. So, service revenues, as it continues to grow and be a big part of our business, it\u2019s actually dilutive to our gross margin and accretive on our operating income line. So, we have really tried to look at kind of the whole picture how we improve margins. So, there are things underway and operating efficiencies to be able to improve gross margin, but there are a lot of pushes and falls and we are guiding to a 58.5% to 59% and we will be working to see if there are other opportunities to improve that, but mix kind of shakes out during the course of the year.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And next we have Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.", "Puneet Souda", "Yes, hi, Chris. Thanks for taking my questions. So I am trying to understand a bit better on the recurring revenue growth. So, you delivered obviously it\u2019s only in the quarter. I was just trying to understand the underlying dynamics, is it related to some of the more product lines, is it a more Glycan kits or columns versus the service contract uptake? Would be helpful if you could just elaborate a bit and give us a sense of sustainability of that in 2018 knowing the pharma uncertainties that you have talked about?", "ChrisO\u2019Connell", "Yes, thanks, Puneet, I appreciate the question. I think the underlying dynamics in the recurring lines were pretty consistent with historical performance. We definitely continue to drive service plan up and certainly we see growth opportunity particularly in the emerging markets where there has been more installed base build out and where more products are still under warranty as those products come off service plan opportunities come on. And so we have opportunities just to continue that slow steady march upward in terms of attach rates on service plans and they are pretty high and pretty stable in the developed markets and there is opportunity for growth in the emerging markets. We also continue to add to our portfolio and professional service offerings and these are the more consultative type of programs that are more informatics driven that customers find incredibly valuable. As it relates to the chemistries it\u2019s really a little bit of both what you mentioned. The core column business is very solid, very solid aftermarket that reflects the high utilization of our systems, but also kind of a gradually improving mix based on the growth of UPLC methods. And as you know UPLC columns tend to be sold at a little more of a premium and we have a higher attach rate on our UPLC platforms than our HPLC platforms. And also the kits Glycan measurement is clearly a great area of interest among a lot of our customers and that plus also protein works and in other offerings we have in that area and we think that it\u2019s a smaller business for us right now in terms of these kits, but one that we think has good growth potential on a pretty sustainable basis.", "Puneet Souda", "Okay. Thanks for that. And one follow-up in terms of you have obviously highlighted in past that smaller accounts and biotechs have become increasingly bigger part of the revenue at Waters over the years and could you give us your sense of sustainability of that over than next year knowing that there is the tax reform driven M&A potentially here and obviously I mean I agree the point that you don\u2019t have the M&A crystal ball neither do we. So I am just trying to understand how to think about if those mid to small sized biotech accounts will continue to become a bigger part of Waters or become consolidated? Thanks.", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes. I guess like I said earlier Puneet, I don\u2019t really have that crystal ball and probably not the best predictor of what might happen in consolidation. All I can share is the experience I have is I go out into the marketplace myself and as our teams work every day. And that\u2019s that there is a broadening base of customers. And there has been a lot of activity at the startup and midsize level as it relates to our business. Many of those companies that I speak with are looking to build bigger franchises over time. They are going after multiple targets. And to the extent some of those companies are more U.S. oriented that gives them some benefit from tax reform as it relates to their own profitability after tax. Again, we \u2013 I would try to gauge the overall inventive and volume related dynamics for the industry at large, almost regardless of who is actually driving that. And we certainly see the big companies driving innovation. We certainly see the small companies driving innovation. And we like that balance that ultimately produces in our business. So it\u2019s a dynamic marketplace and we will just have to what you play out and see where the opportunities are.", "Puneet Souda", "Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "I think we have time for about two more questions here before we run out of the top of the hour.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question will be from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan", "Thank you. Good morning, I want to ask about new products, you mentioned that growing testing needs for large molecule, could you give us an update on BioTOF and do you think that could be a contributor in 2018?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Sure, yes. Let me give you quick comment on product and we remind you of my typical answer and that\u2019s that new branding products are really important, but also the new technology that\u2019s in the market is really what\u2019s driving our business clearly in the last 2 years, 3 years, 4 years we have had some great entrants across the board from QD arc to QDA to TQS Micro, TQXS, the discovery series in TA. And we are really keying on a lot of those technologies along with legacy acuity and legacy alliance and all the associated chemistries. In \u201818 we have a number of platform enhancements that are coming out that don\u2019t sound like big fancy new products, but are really important in terms of enhancing the overall application success of our customers. And then BioTOF continues to move well through development. I don\u2019t want to put a specific timeline on the launch, but I am very excited about this program to provide more of an off-the-shelf solution for about molecule characterization that we believe can work its way right into the heart of the routine and regulated workflows first in development than in QA QC. We think there is a lot of demand in the market for it and all I will say is that the product development teams are working very hard and making very good progress. And I anticipate that as we move through the year, I will be able to give you a better sense as to when the market might see that.", "Jack Meehan", "Great. Looking forward to it. And then just one on the quarter, you mentioned some of the India GST disruption came back, is that fully worked through the system now and maybe just where did that contribute in the quarter?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes. So, India as you know had a \u2013 we had a decline in Q3 as we had some delays with GST. It\u2019s a complex process of harmonization in terms of both state and national transaction taxes. We did make good progress. One of the things to note though is that the laws around GST are still evolving and that system catch-up that I have talked about before is I think doing well, but still not out of the woods yet and so we think that this as we have said before that the full catch-up process takes more than a quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s fully back to normal yet, but I think we are probably through the toughest pieces of it and we are supporting our India team with everything we have as company to keep everything moving while we get through it, but there really \u2013 there wasn\u2019t any loss in demand through the process it was just more of a transition to work through and we are excited about our India business.", "Jack Meehan", "Thanks, Chris.", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Okay. I think we are one more here.", "Operator", "Alright. Our last question will come from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken", "Good afternoon, guys. Good morning. So maybe just on China, can you just give me a view on sort of how you are thinking about the cadence obviously it\u2019s been strong all year and I am more interested in sort of dividing it into kind of the emerging biopharma and generic customers versus sort of some of the more traditional parts of industrial that you touch?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Sure. Yes, thanks for the question on China, Ross, as you know I am excited about China, I was excited about China for my whole career in medical devices and now here at Waters and I think there is just a lot of interesting things going on in that economy as China really moves towards a local innovation economy. Our China business as I have commented before is actually more balanced than most of our major geographies in fact, while 60% of our worldwide revenue is in pharma, only about 50% or even a little less of the business in China is related to pharma, but there is a broad as you suggest a broad backdrop of industrial business of food being over-indexed in China and also the material science business there. I guess I feel like what we are trying to do is to key off some of the major government initiatives, obviously, a lot of the focus now has been on some of the evolution in pharma, there is significant investment in local companies seeking to serve the Chinese market on the small molecule side, but also on biosimilars, I just was in China in mid-December and one night sat down with 10 CEOs of biosimilar companies that were all Chinese biosimilar companies serving the local market and I can\u2019t quite quantify what that exactly means, but I do see a lot of drive for innovation and a lot of optimism that those markets are there and that the government is going to support those therapies as come to patients. There are some broader things going on in China too around one belt, one road around healthy China 2030 and other key initiatives that we are just making sure that we are providing the type of technologies in service, but that companies in China need to take advantage of those trends. So, there is definitely a tilt towards some localization there and we are looking at strategies as to how we continue to localize, but overall we are just trying to maintain that balance in that growth and make sure we feed the eagles in China with the right investments, so that they can continue to grow and perform.", "Ross Muken", "That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just to close things out, so as we think about \u201818 forecast. This is business pretty predictable, lot of recurring revenue, I guess variability tends to come on the instrument line, if you are thinking about sort of the key sub-segments whether it would be geographic product or end market that is likely to sort of drive maybe a differentiated view versus your original forecast, where do you see the most likely sort of volatility or maybe variability and kind of the assumptions and what markets maybe you have the best sort of inclination versus maybe is there anything, it seems like everything is so positive where you see a little bit of caution?", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a crystal ball type question that I would hesitate to put too fine a point on. Obviously, there are different dynamics as it relates to comps, tougher comps and easier comps in various quarters by various geographies and the math is fairly clear there, but I guess the thing that I am assuming and I feel good about is the balance across geographies backed by some reasonable assumptions in the overall global economy and balance across our customer-defined end markets that we saw this year. I mean, if you look at 2017 overall we got 7% out of pharma, 5% out of industrial and 6% out of government and academic. And while those numbers are not completely similar to historic numbers, they do underscore the balance that we see in our business right now. So balance, balance, balance is what we strive for and we will obviously build plans to address unforeseen circumstances as they come up, but just keep our eye on the ball as it relates to delivering this year, but also investing in things that are exciting and will lead to sustainable growth for the future.", "Chris O\u2019Connell", "So, anyway with that, I think we need to wrap up. We are a little over the hour and I do want to thank all of you for your great questions. Concluding now, we are pleased with our fourth quarter as I mentioned and our full year results for 2017 and it was headlined by our ability to deliver consistently strong organic revenue growth combined with disciplined P&L management to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth. As we move into 2018, we remain focused on execution and feel that market conditions combined with our strong competitive position support continued success. So, on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you for your support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q1 2018 call, which we currently anticipate holding on April 24, 2018. Thank you and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you.
